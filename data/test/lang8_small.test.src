O f course I w an n ' t going to c ry
I was rather going to re l i e ve him
When I see him and his ga un t face , I could n ' t c he c k the f l ow of tea r
I re al i z ed what I ' m f a c ing , he is pass ing away
I could n ' t tell him what I was going to tell well because tea r s kept in ter e f er ing
And also I re al i z ed I can not po s s i b ly put my gra t it ud e into w or d s
I v ow ed to work as much as I can and con t ri b ut e to the world to his face
B e y on d that , I only could tell him " T h an k you for every g h ing , every g h ing you ga ve to me . " And I left his house with saying " S e e you la ter
If I di e tomorrow , I would feel I could n ' t put what he had ga ve to me to account enough
So I de c id ed to try to take more op po t un it ies to tell my f ri ed n s , my j o un i or s and you who is read ing my di ar y what I le ar n ed unti l now
And I ' ll try hard er to leave more things to this world

I ' m sure it will f a ll
B e c a us e I ' m sure that it is im po s s i ble to make this mo v i e ex c ept for J a p an e se
What I ' m try ing to say is , even if you are a great c he f , you can ' t make a dis h of J a p an e se c u is in e with A m er ic an sea s on ing
A h , I cannot express my feel ing well
There is only one thing that I am clear of it
It is I am glad that I could watch this mo v i e
A fter we had l un ch at ? ? , we went to the N a g o y a C a st le
P er ha p s I had been there before , I did n ' t re m e m b er anything of it
It looked with re al ity

I feel so tired and I c ri ed s ever al time s
I don ' t have time to do myself
How can I do
I feel so de p re s s ion
how to make friend s
When i am you ng , I find it ' s very easy to make a new friend
However , it ' s more and more hard now
Why ? , I think it is because of the lack of tru st
When we are l it ter , w e even don ' t know what is right and what is wrong
