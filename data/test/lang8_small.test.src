And his inmost thoughts are living in me
Of course I wann't going to cry
I was rather going to relieve him
When I see him and his gaunt face, I couldn't check the flow of tear
I realized what I'm facing, he is passing away
I couldn't tell him what I was going to tell well because tears kept interefering
And also I realized I can not possibly put my gratitude into words
I vowed to work as much as I can and contribute to the world to his face
Beyond that, I only could tell him \" Thank you for everyghing, everyghing you gave to me.\"  And I left his house with saying \" See you later
If I die tomorrow, I would feel I couldn't put what he had gave to me to account enough
So I decided to try to take more oppotunities to tell my friedns, my jouniors and you who is reading my diary what I learned until now
And I'll try harder to leave more things to this world
I represents my honorable grandpa
I should never disgrace his honor
Today I had my third time of the English conversation class
We talked about the article, \"Asian youth forgetting how to write
First we were given a paper which is written the article but some sentences are blanked
Then the teacher read the article to us
And we filled out the blanks
What is your favorite pan?(ﾉ´∀｀
Oh, there is a home work due next week
Then it hit me
Does anyone know this one??(；´Д｀
My favorite one is, \"There was a sign on the lawn at a drug re-hab center that said 'Keep off the Grass
Today I went to the Atsuta shrine and the Shiratori Japanese style garden
A Shinto shrine is a structure which is made as the house of kami-sama
It's placed in a hour from my house but I had never been there
As you see in the picture, that was really, really beautiful
t I felt like \"the true colors of Japan\" was there
The second picture is the oldest bridge in Nagoya
There are some rules about paying homage at a shrine
2 You have to walk left side of the road because its center is for the kami-sama to walk
Then tap your hands twice , bow and wish your desire in your heart
At this point, you shouldn't speak your wish in voice
These are some of conventions of Shinto
But I saw many people didn't follow them
Japanese style gardens are often made in imitation of the real scenery
And this is the biggest Japanese style garden in Nagoya which imitated the scenery of this area
It has quaint atmosphere
I think leaves of the trees will turn in autumn and it must be really beautiful
It's been 2 days since I met you, my brain is full of you
Because if I touch you I think everything I've established gonna collapse
That fear alienate you
If I've got on you in my birthday suit, 
with holding by you until the moon sets over the sea, and share the panorama of the color of the sky
I would've not feeling this gloom
How many times will I have sleepless nights
I cannot concentrate on anything but I'm just more in love with you
dear my new bed
I'm not in good shape
This morning I woke up with the horrible stomachache
So I ran into the bathroom as soon as I left the bed
I don't feel good since last Saturday
This happens periodically
It's like the air is being thin only around me
I can't center my focus on the studying
I made a rule! 
On the day of my birthday, I made a rule to never fail to write a jounal everyday
This was way I was in haste last night
It is the biggest priority for me to make good on my promises
But I will keep up
I will try to be undaunted
Now it's 12:30 in Japan now
I don't know what else to say
It might be the best movie I've ever watched
I have watched many movies
But I had never watched such movie before
So I don't know how to remark on it
Actually, Radiohead’s Last Flowers is used as an overture for the film
I've heard the news that Hollywood is remaking it with Daniel Radcliffe and Nicole Kidman
I'm sure it will fall
Because I'm sure that it is impossible to make this movie except for Japanese
What I'm trying to say is, even if you are a great chef, you can't make a dish of Japanese cuisine with American seasoning
Ah, I cannot express my feeling well
There is only one thing that I am clear of it
It is I am glad that I could watch this movie
After we had lunch at 矢場とん, we went to the Nagoya Castle
Perhaps I had been there before, I didn't remember anything of it
It looked with reality
Then we moved to 栄 and went to the restaurant which serves cake buffet
They served more than 15 kinds of cakes and we could eat as many as we want
They serve cream puffs, custard puddings, short cakes, and many other cakes which I had never seen before
The clerks ,customers and everyone in the house sang birthday song toghether
We had plenty of cakes and great time
Then we took 名無しさん and Porschla to the bus station and they departured to Takayama
They had a free day in Nagoya because the flight reserved would departure this afternoon
depression
I feel tired the last few days
Our school's rock club declared that I become next year the activities leader of rock club
I have to host our club's activity of Sea Music Festival
A lots of things around me :club,schoolwork,relationships,activity
I feel so tired and I cried several times
I don't have time to do myself
How can I do
I feel so depression
how to make friends
When i am young,I find it's very easy to make a new friend
However,it's more and more hard now
Why?,I think it is because of the lack of trust
When we are litter,we even don't know what is right and what is wrong
