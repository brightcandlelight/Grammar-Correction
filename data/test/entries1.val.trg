And he took in my favor ite sub j e c t s like so c c er .
A c t u ally , he was the one who let me know about L an g - 8 . .
H is Ka n j i ability is much better than mi ne .
We ' ve know n each other for only half a year , but his less on s were a l ot of f un .
I heard a sen t ence last night when I was watch ing T V .
When you go down h i ll , you have to st ic k out your ch est or you will f a ll down .
When you go up h i ll , you have to be n d your back .
It is like when you are con f ro n ted with f r ust r ation and you have to keep your con f id ence .
When everything is going s m o o th ly , you have to be more mo d est .
When I was at school , we pai n ted a l ot of w o o d en hand y w or k , like small p l ate s and case s .
M a k ing so u ve n ir s is a hard but interest ing work .
i F in ally my mother took me to the c ust o m s w in d ow , and ga ve a pass p or t to the man . . .
There are two b a ll s : one with a c at inside , the other with do g .
You know , you can ( w in ? ) them at a s l ot machi ne .
The th ir d me m or y is the house where we live d .
It was sit u at ed near He l s in k i , a big and light house with e a small la ke behind it . It was w in ter , so it was f ro z en .
I do n ' t know why .
I like d F in l and in the W in ter .
And I ho pe I ' ll like F in l and in the S um m er .
J ust start im p ro v is ing ! `` To tell the tru th , I myself did n ' t expect
If only I had de n se black c ur tain s .
A co up le of week s a g o , I heard a new W h it ne y H ous t on t un e / so ng on my c ar ra d i o .
I had been wonder ing what she was / has been do ing .
It said that it was dis a p po in ting .
O l d and not beautiful . . . . . ( w w w w w )
I know about her t um ul t u ous mar ri age with B o b b y B r ow n and an ar d u ous b at t le with her dr u g a d d i ction .
she still has n ' t re c o ver ed from them ?
M or e dis a p po in ting to me is she said the reason for her bad voice that day ? was because she talk ed with O p r a h W in f re y too much on her show .
That might be one of the reason s , however , to me it just sound s like an ex c us e .
I would say after 1 0 year s of wait ing , it has not f a il ed it s ti t le , at least not from my first impress ion .
A n y way , I think I ' ll sp en d quite some time play ing it in the next f e w week s .
O K , that ' s all for my first ent ry .
B e f or e , I went to the l i b r ar y .
On the way I got a head a ch e .
So , I think if we have to go some where on f o ot , we must put on our ha t .
If we did n ' t do that and walk ed for long time , we would will co ll a p se or di e .
If my sen t ence s are n ' t p r a c t ical , please c or re c t them .
This morning I found out that one of my f a v o ur ite b and s re le as ed a new al b um .
I already for g ot about R is e A g a in st and it is a great surprise for me , because I have n ' t listen ed to them for 2 year s .
I ho pe this b and did n ' t become w or se , like many other s big one s did , and I ' ll enjoy listen ing to it .
Well , I just have to get it and c he c k it out .
It ' s because my m um is probab ly the be st c ook I have ever me t in my life .
C ook ing is not her pro f es s ion ; but rather , she is a house w if e .
I have eat en at hotel s and have had ex p en s ive me al s but they are nothing like what she c ook s .
I would rather be work ing outside than be a house w if e .
I think it ' s been about one and half year s now .
I should have ex p l o d ed the who le bu il d ing so I can de st ro y ~ them ! ! !
I had to write about co un se ling .
This is my first time writing a di ar y on the in ter ne t .
I ho pe some on e will see my di ar y and c or re c t it .
I watch ed a D V D of `` G re y ' s an at o m y `` to day .
A c t u ally I watch it a l ot the se days .
So there is a l ot to see .
I do n ' t know all the me d ical w or d s in English .
But I can study English with it .
And I think it ' s f un , right ? ( Y E A H ! )
I ' m eat ing a b an an a every day for my he al th .
B an an as give s me en er g y .
I have to make a new s p a p er in English as my s um m er va c ation home w or k and I de c id ed to in t ro d u ce about my do g in the new s p a p er .
I will in t ro d u ce my do g , T i ar a .
She is a c he er ful and p l um p pretty do g , per ha p s she is the c ut est do g in the world .
She ' s an 8 year old go l d en re t ri ever
He r f ur is a beautiful am b er co l o ur and is so f t .
She is a little st up id , but has per c ept ive in s i g h t s about f o o d because she is always f a m ish ed ^ ^ She l o ve s f o o d !
When she is b as k ing she look s very con t ent .
However , I ho p ed it would ra in to day because it is too hot .
I saw a new s ar t ic le on Ya h o o yesterday .
It re p or ted that C h i en - M ing W an g c ut his ha ir and has a new ha ir style .
He re is the l in k :
It talk ed about there being a big di f f er ence about different va l u es of a hand s ome man between We s ter n co un t ri es and E aster n co un t ri es .
It me n tion ed many ex amp le s of J a p an e se me n , K or e an me n , and H on g K on g me n .
They pai d much at ten tion to their face s and sp ent l ot s of money to sh op .
But in We s ter n co un t ri es , the stand ar d of a hand s ome man depend s not on their face s , but on their ma s c u line s y m b o l s , like m us c le and be ha v i or .
I started to not ic e the way s of for e i g n c l o th ing and ha ir style s the se past days by watch ing T V pro g r a m s , such as F ri en d s , S c r u b s , e t c .
If they had a long ha ir , it would be re ally long and th ic k .
B y con t r a st , me n in e aster n co un t ri es dress up more .
A p ar t from a shirt and j e an s , we usual ly we ar an access or y .
As to ha ir , me n usual ly have me d i um ha ir , neither very short or long .
If we want to c ut our ha ir short , we must leave some ha ir on the back of ne c k in or d er to a v o id look ing like a n er d .
It almost co st me a who le morning .
I have to watch the N B A ' s f in al game 3 .
I like you give me any commen t s and opinion s too .
I would re ally like to dis c us s .
My so n has di ar r he a
When I came back home from work to day , my so n had di ar r he a .
It was like water and his bo t t o m was re d .
We were p l an n ing to go to my home t ow n tomorrow .
We were all read y to go .
But we had to c ance l the tri p .
But there ' s no way we can go .
I am listen ing to m us ic on the co m m ut er train .
To day , I listen the m us ic , it feel s like I am in a c a f e .
I like the w ar m sea s on .
So , I like sp r ing .
S p r ing is a very ex c it ing sea s on .
In J a p an , the new school and work year start s in sp r ing .
I ho pe to become qu al if i ed in English .
I ho pe to get a new pro m o tion .
E ver y day , there are new things to try .
. . . No , very f re qu ent ly .
S t ar ting to day , I ' m going to try write a di ar y every day ! !
To day has nothing sp e c al to write ! !
It ' s a kind of T a i - w an style ma s s age .
I l o v ed the ma s s age sh op where I went because the s ta f f of the sh op explain ed what is wrong in my body .
A fter that , I went to a f it ness c l u b which has be d r ock bath ing .
I felt re la x ed to take a be d r ock bath ^ ^
I went to S en d a i as a business tri p to day .
The sp e c i al pro d u c t of S en d a i is a co w ' s to n gue .
I b ough t it and at e it at home .
I want to eat this co w ' s to n gue again .
My d aught er / She was w o k en up by my w if e .
The w if e was w o k en up by my s ter t or / s n or ing .
Where to hold it and when we should leave has not been de c id ed yet !
So , even now I feel n er v ous , wonder ing if it ' s re ally going to be he l d .
And I want to live my life at my own p a ce .
B e c a us e when I ' ve finish ed my class es , home w or k or job s e t c . . .
It ' s near ly 1 0 p m when I get back home .
It ' s near ly 1 2 p m .
I ' ve been s u f f er ing many un ha p p y things the se days .
M a y b e things are n ' t so bad own their own , but I re ally c a n ' t hand le them when they o c c ur to g e ther . . . .
I do n ' t know how to m aster this language . . .
T h ough I sp en d most of my time and en er g y in le ar n ing English , it ' s become a p p ar ent that I ' ve hard ly made any im p ro ve ment .
I do n ' t know why it ' s so hard for me to le ar n English ! ! !
our teacher said something to me that made my heart b re a k . .
I had never know n my English was poor unti l the teacher told me that my English sound ed i ll o g ical . . . .
S um m er H o l i day
I had a long b re a k time .
I should study again .
I got up at 6 : 3 0 a m in J a p an .
He ll o ! N ic e to me e t you ! My name is A il s a .
I ho pe to make many friend s on la ng - 8 .
T h an k you every on e !
E le ction s will be he l d on A u g ust 3 0 th .
The M a y er is s up p or ting H a m ad a for the mi n is ter of de f en se .
H a m ad a be l on g ' s to the L i b er al D e m o c r at ic P ar ty .
This time they may los e a d m in is t r ation .
The D e m o c r at ic P ar ty has more s up p or ter s than they do .
The M a y er is bu s y with the e le ction c amp a i g n as well as his own work .
I ' m going to help ing him with his work as his se c re ta ry .
I went to a Ka n a z a w a U n ive r s ity f est i v al with my A m er ic an friend .
I made a good friend with a V i e t n ame se .
We enjoy ed it very much .
And we had dinner with my other friend s .
. To day was an am a z ing day .
It is made of sp on g e : ) It is c ut e .
I receiv ed an accept ance letter and s ch o l ar s h i p from the B er k le e C o ll e g e of M us ic .
I ' ll ent er / go to B er k le e in the f a ll se m est er this year .
However I have two w or ri es .
One of them is that my English is still very c l um s y .
A no ther is the high - p ri c ed t u i tion fee s .
A n y way , I ' m study ing English at the T O E F L In st it ut e the se days .
B er k le e do n ' t require s a T O E F L s c or e .
I have a l ot of as s i g n ment s every day .
It ' s very difficult to do all of them , but I always try to make my be st effort .
I ' m le ar n ing English , but it ' s re ally difficult for me !
S ever al days a g o , I had an ir re g ul ar heart b e at for the first time in my life !
It was like this ; I s ud d en ly started to feel some so r t of of dis c o m f or t around my heart .
I was very s c ar ed because I had been very he al th y so far .
I ' m still in my 2 0 ' s .
D o I have to live with it for the re st of my life ? ``
The do c t or told me that I did o c c as ion ally have an ir re g ul ar p ul se but it was not a f at al one .
He a d d ed that it could get w or se d u e to str es s and f at i gue , and he just a d v is ed me to take as much re st as need ed .
I was re l i e v ed to he ar the do c t or ' s di a g no s is , but I ' m still w or ri ed .
I think that may be a co m m on question for those students who want to p ur s u e high er education .
What C h in e se un ive r s it ies off er their students is most ly course w or k b as ed c ur ri c ul um .
I ' ve s um m ed up some point s which I think are im p or t ant and us e ful .
You can co un t on G o o g le as your be st friend , a d v is er and an almost in f in ite re s o ur ce of a c ad e m ic paper s .
M an y of them you can down l o ad as a p d f copy , or if you c a n ' t down l o ad a paper from the l in k s s ch o l ar . go o g le . co m off er s you , go direct ly to the a u th or ' s we b s ite , many a u th or s enjoy their paper to be see n and cited by read er s .
A good re v i e w is the be st start ing point .
And then you can tra ce the a u th or , or the paper cited , to do a more in de p th re se ar ch into your are a of interest .
The c or re c t b al ance of w id th and de p th of your read ing is es s ent i al .
B o th way s have their me ri t s and dis ad v ant age s .
In no v at ive and original idea s are good , but if you can not find them , you should know that most of re se ar ch work is just re f in e ment of other ' s work .
I ' ll sp en d the next f e w week s / the coming week s on board the `` J ust o S i er r a `` ve s s el c ar ry ing out some g e op h y s ical re se ar ch and le ar n ing .
The bad thing is , I have n ' t le ar n ed the ve s s el ' s part s in English yet .
The thing that I want to do in J an u ar y 2 0 0 9 is to put in more effort in study ing English and keep on writing sen t ence s in English every day here in L an g - 8 !
However there were not so many people there , so we did n ' t need to wait our turn outside .
I think that M an g a is the great est for m of ent er tain ment in J a p an e se c ul ture .
My favor ite write r s are N a o k i U r as a w a ( The M on s ter , 2 0 th C ent ur y B o y , e t c . ) and H i ro y a O ku ( G ant z ) .
B y the way , I found some we b sit es with a hu g e am o un t of M an g a tra n s la ted into English .
( I think they are no do u b t il le g al . )
It ' s a new ex pe ri ence and very education al for le ar n ing English .
But I think that there are a l ot of difficult express ion s in English M an g a .
D i a g no s ed with being easily impress ed .
I re al i z ed that I ' m the kind of person who is easily impress ed .
I ' m mo v ed by very simple things that other people might not even have a second look at .
F or in st ance , I started watch ing some In d i an mo v ies about a month a g o .
When I had the time , though , I b ough t about six In d i an mo v ies to watch .
The first mo v i e I watch ed made me c ry for two hour s like a five - year - old who los t her do ll .
A c t u ally all In d i an mo v ies have the same b as ic idea .
However , I con t in u ed c ry ing d ur ing the re st of the five f il m s and each one of them impress ed me even more .
In d i an mo v ies are like c la y that can be mo l d ed into many different sha pe s while still re m a in ing c la y .
This conc ept might be a b it am b i g u ous for those who have n ' t been in such a sit u ation .
I took some me d ic in e , so I feel better for now .
`` 4 5 0 time s ``
This is my 4 5 0 th di ar y .
I started keep ing a di ar y around 2 0 0 8 .
T h an k s to the people all over the world , I ' m having a f un and so l id time .
C ha ng ing the sub j e c t , but I got a call from my friend yesterday .
I was somewhat p u z z led what to say .
He ll o ! My name is K en .
I just started study ing English .
However , it is ter ri b ly difficult .
The no ve l is about an im p or t ant R o man po l it ic an called / name d G a i us M ar i us .
He is the ma in character , al th ough other s like C or n el i us S il la , M e t el us , and C a es ar ' s gr and f a ther also appear .
M ar i us did n ' t come from an im p or t ant family , but he became a con s ul because he was a c l ever and p op ul ar g en er al in the R o man ar m y .
So , after he was made con s ul by the R o man s , he went to A f ri c a , where he f ough t against Y u g ur ta , who was k ing of N um id i a .
M ar i us w on the w ar in two year s , and when he went back to R ome he was made con s ul again for five year s .
M ar i us had to fight other tri b es in the no r th of I ta ly , unti l 1 0 0 B .
He had to s te p down from p ow er because he got sick .
I l o ve study ing .
B y the way , do you like to study ?
I ' ve just receiv ed an in ter n ation al call on my ce ll p h on e .
I was wonder ing if it was from one of my friend s .
But it was from K or e a ' s qu ar ant in e de po t ,
We do n ' t have the se s y m p t o m s right now .
If it help s , this picture is the i nformation they ga ve us at J a p an ' s qu ar ant in e de po t when we return ed to J a p an .
is any on e free ?
let s ha ng out in to k y o ~ ha ha ~ x D
im free unti l next month .
c u z I don have a school unti l then ! !
I do n ' t like it .
A l th ough most people think about what ha p p i ness is like , most people never do u b t that there is ha p p i ness some where in a hu man ' s life .
A f a m ous man , I heard , said in the past that the w or st thing for you is to be b or n in the world .
This is just my n ic k n ame .
I st ud i ed at a un ive r s ity in Tokyo .
I receiv ed a b a ch el or ' s de g re e in a p p l i ed p h y s ic s and electronic s .
I change d job s a f e w time s but always kept the same ty pe of job as an e ng in e er .
I c ur r ent ly work for an electronic s make r in J a p an as an e ng in e er .
My p ar ent s , brother , and s is ter live in Tokyo .
F u ku o k a is l o c at ed the no r ther n part of K y us h u ,
which is a part of the J a p an e se A r ch i pe la g o .
C o m p ar ed with Tokyo , F u ku o k a is a comp a c t but very co m f or t able c ity .
C o m m o d ity p ri ce s here are l ow er than those in Tokyo , and F u ku o k a A ir p or t is very near c ent r al F u ku o k a .
N ar it a A ir p or t is far from c ent r al Tokyo .
M or e o ver , Tokyo is a very c r ow d ed c ity .
One thing I do not like about living here is that I ' m se p ar at ed from my family .
It co st s a l ot of money to go see my p ar ent s from here .
A n English less on for H a ll ow e en
I ' m an e le ment ar y school teacher , as you might know .
In J a p an , start ing next year we will off ic i ally have to tea ch English to 5 th and 6 th gra d er s .
I have already made some English class es for the ch il d re n .
The to p ic of the less on was H a ll ow e en .
We provide d act i v it ies to get the students not only to keep enjoy ing the less on , but also to keep some v o c a b ul ar y in mind before they le ar n it .
One of them is `` H a ll ow e en T ri v i a and B ing o `` .
The students need to answer question s about H a ll ow e en that I ' ve p re p ar ed by play ing B ing o .
The more answer s they get c or re c t , the more B ing o they can play .
A fter the class , I asked the students to f i ll out a question n a i re .
I was very glad to find [ that ] they like d the less on .
One of my ul t im ate go al s as an English teacher is that all students look at the world b ro ad ly .
I ' m sure you ' ll have p l ent y of op p or t un it ies not only to co m m un ic ate with people from other co un t ri es , but also to le ar n about s ever al c ul t ur al di f f er ence s through the less on .
I believe this will le ad them to accept ing more cha ll e ng es .
That ' s why I ' m very ex cited to tea ch students English ! !
It is It ' s been c l o ud y or and ra in y re c ent ly .
A l th ough my school was no le c ture does n ' t have a le c ture , I got up e ar ly in the morning to day .
It co st six do ll ar s to was h ing for the la un d ry and co st six do ll ar s to for the dr y er .
When I was h ing end ed , it was even ing . L a un d ry end ed ti ll even ing .
I went to the c a ke sh op in the c ity that my friend in t ro d u c ed to has been tell ing me and it has a as n ic e ta s te and f a m ous .
The sh op of in n er de c or at ing de c or s was gr e en .
A fter I came went back home , I c ook ed dinner , and the f o o d for dinner was were p r a w n s & a v o c ad o s al ad , ro a st ch ic k en and O T A M A S A N G O H A N .
F ir st , I c ut the let t u ce , c ut co ar se ly a the to m at o co ar se ly and then s ta ir - f ly f ry some p r a w n s .
The O T A M A S A N G O H A N is J a p an e se on ly tra d i tion al f o o d .
It only sp r in k le s the ra w e g g and a p in ch d ash of the so y so ur ce on w ar m ri ce .
They were easy to c ook ing but they ta st ed n ic e ! !
A fter that I watch ed two mo v ies , an im ation of g en i us bo y and 0 0 7 , on T V for a p p ro x im ate ly four hour s .
I a p p re c i ate you teaching English to my d aught er .
I was look ing for an English class around here .
We thought about just tak ing a tri al less on , but she told me that she want ed to go to the less on again .
I am very surprise d about her pro g re s s .
No w she is very interest ed in speak ing English , writing the al p ha b e t ( w or d s ) and s ing ing W H A T ' S Y O U R N A M E ?
We ow e her pro g re s s to you
It will be a b a se when she go es to a new school .
If I did n ' t need to take care of my kid s , I would want to take your less on s !
It is very easy to come with kid s because it is c le an , s a f e , just a 1 - hour time di f f er ence and close to the H an ed a a ir p or t .
A fter , un ive r s ity class es , I went direct ly back home , p re p ar ed pack age s and sea r ch ed what time I should leave home and which train s I should take .
And if the tea m w in s 8 game s , the tea m will get first position .
But / However the re m a in d er of it s game s is 9 game s .
There f or e it is difficult for it to get first position .
The start ing p it ch er was not good , there f or e the op po s i tion got 3 point s easily .
We c he er ed very hard , but the mi r a c le never happen ed .
T h o se are such things as play ing sp or t s , read ing b ook s , listen ing to m us ic , tak ing walk s .
My favor ite ho b b y is talk ing with my friend s , because I think it is the be st time to be with my friend s .
I ga in ed about 1 0 k il o g r a m s after I qu it my c l u b s in high school .
That ' s why I have to los e some we i g h t ! ! !
So , I always j o g and ex er c is e . (
I w an n a have a six - pack ! ! ha ha
This week en d , there are three ho l i day s in J a p an .
They are on S at ur day , S un day and M on day .
M on day is E qu in o x D a y .
It will gradua l ly become w ar m .
J a p an e se are wait ing for ch er ry b l o s s o m s in this sea s on .
Yes ter day was the same .
But N e x t week I will go on business tri p s .
To m or r ow I do n ' t have much work .
I will go to the l i b r ar y and to the c a f e to study electronic s after that .
My friend star r ed in the play .
She and I became friend s when we were j un i or high school students .
O ur friend s h i p s has last ed for more than 1 0 year s .
I saw her act for the first time to day .
To day is a J a p an e se N ation al ho l i day .
So I took a three - day week en d .
S in ce it was ra in y yesterday and to day , My family and I could n ' t enjoy it .
C h il d re n were play ing game s for a very long time .
And re al i z ed how language s can help you know more people .
R e ad ing English make me feel very ha p p y .
I was impress ed with my life there very much .
I only told them in English
that it would be good if I could speak
It might be b or ing .
and re m e m b er ing Ka n j i that I like ^ _ ^
J a p an e se f o o d is a v a il able at every corner in T ha il and .
I think / believe b ir d s of a f e a ther f l ock to g e ther .
The other day , I me t one of my class m ate from high school at a st ation , for the first time in f if te en year s .
I ' m an English teacher .
On the other hand , she tea ch es c or re c t walk ing and po s ture .
We made small talk / had a short con ver s ation there and left .
When I started to walk , I had an ur g e of want ing to talk with her more !
So I called out to her and stop p ed her .
We ex change d our con ta c t in f o and de c id ed to me e t again very soon .
We me t once more two week s a g o , I felt strange / no st al g ic then because we had n ' t me t each other for many year s , but still we had many things ( that we want ed ) to tell each other .
P l ent y of things to talk about , but there was n ' t s u f f ic i ent time .
We should n ' t so r t people into le ve l s / ty pe s / c ate g or ies and I believe we are ( all ) living on the same le ve l ( same c ate g or y , same world ) .
I do n ' t like watch ing a s c re en when it ' s too close so I k il led time read ing something .
To day , I read `` The C at ch er in the R y e `` as a s um m er home w or k as s i g n ment .
To tell the tru th , I could not understand why this b ook is thought of as a m aster p i e ce .
B e c a us e I did n ' t feel b or ed when I was read ing it , but I was not very ex cited or mo v ed .
If you had read the b ook , please tell me which part you think is interest ing .
2 1 . 1 2 . 2 0 1 2 * * * I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent .
H i , I ' ve started L an g - 8 .
I want to le ar n English and find friend s here .
C an we become friend s ?
I live d in L on d on from 2 0 0 5 to 2 0 0 8 ,
But I c a n ' t speak English . . . ( ; _ ; )
So please tea ch me English ! !
I gradua te from un ive r s ity in 2 0 1 2 .
so I want to ex change i nformation about my job around the world .
I called for a refund for the P ar k Y on g - ha conc er t ti c ke t s .
I heard that they sen d money by re g is ter ed ma il by A u g ust 1 3 th .
C ul ture of sh ame
F or e i g n me d i a a d m ir es how J a p an e se people are be h aving c al m ly , or g an is ed and in a s up p or ting manner .
But it ' s co m m on for us J a p an e se .
We think that ma k ing trouble for other s is a very bad and sh ame ful thing .
E ver y p ar ent want s their ch il d re n not to trouble other s .
In the past , J a p an e se gr e w ri ce which was need ed to help other s in the co m m un ity .
It would be great if you c or re c t my mistake s .
T h an k s a . l ot .
I did n ' t know why I lie d , but at that time I b l an k ed out .
It was about a job I s ough t from the new s paper .
A l th ough I know a p ri v ate school st ud ent like me in S ing a po re is st ic t ly pro h i b it to go to have a job .
I am still going to the place to try my l u c k .
When my a un t i e asked me what kind of pass I he l d .
But for me I am more f o c us ed on le ar n ing the ex pe ri ence through work ing and co m m un ic at ing with other s .
B y the way , the job is re ally a short - ter m job ( se ll er ) , which only last s for two week s .
To day I saw a mo v i e called T w i light .
But some of them made me feel dis g ust ed .
E d w ar d is c ut e , he care d about B el la .
And B el la is a strong girl .
Yes ter day , J a p an ' s n ation al so c c er tea m play ed against A ust r al i a .
It was the f in al ma t ch of the As i an C up 2 0 1 1 .
F ive days a g o , J a p an play ed 1 2 0 minute s , includ ing ex t r a time , against So u th K or e a , further m or e , the a ver age he i g h t of the A ust r al i an tea m is ta ll er than J a p an .
So I thought most of the J a p an e se me m b er s would be tired and the game would be very hard for them .
The game went into ex t r a time t w ic e in a r ow in the se m i - f in al game for J a p an .
However , at 1 1 0 minute s , L e e , who came off the be n ch , got the go al !
I ' m very glad that J a p an w on !
D o you like s ing ing ?
I like to s ing very much .
To day , I went to the k ar a o ke bo x with my so n and ne i g h b or s .
I s an g so many so ng s and re l i e v ed my str es s .
My favor ite k ar a o ke so ng s are by S e i k o M at s ud a .
He r so ng s are easy to s ing to , know n by many people , and they also have good r h y th m s .
I had a re la x ing time .
To day I might f a ll as le e p soon .
L on g a g o , my father got a g u it ar .
h He ' s still the own er .
I do n ' t know but I of ten us e it more than him .
I ' ll do my be st !
It is the sea s on of ch er ry tree s in J a p an right now .
He re are some reason why we l o ve them .
The time from b l o o m to f al ling is very e ar ly .
It is like a hu man life . ( t ate m a e ! )
It is a l ot of f un to dr in k while see ing them .
I had a head a ch e , was tired , and had no a p pe t ite .
I s l ept all day unti l I had to work .
The day before yesterday , I hung around with one of my C h in e se friend s .
We went to J I N M A O O B S ER V A T O R Y 8 8 .
It was a rather high bu il d ing .
D o you know me ?
I am a her o .
But I am also a ro b ot who is hand led by a re m o te con t ro l .
F or t un ate ly , I am a her o of just ic e .
So I am called , `` The He ro of J ust ic e . ``
My name is `` T e t u z in 2 8 go `` , which mean s `` ir on man No . 2 8 `` .
If the re m o te con t ro l is take n by an e v il person ,
I am tru ly a her o of just ic e though .
Where am I ?
H in t : In J a p an .
O k in a w a is in the so u ther n m o st part of J a p an so it was hot there .
We enjoy ed s n or ke ling !
We went to the be a ch which is an de s er t is l and near N a ha .
I felt like I was in dr e a m because the sea was so beautiful and there was a l ot of fish .
And we went to O k in a w a P re f e c t ur al P e a ce M e m or i al M us e um .
I think that the w ar should never of happen ed .
To day was my ch in e se friend ' s b ir th day .
She is a 2 6 year - old woman who works for a tra ve l a g en c y .
In addition , she is p ur s u ing a mo d el ing care er in J a p an .
We me t at a night c l u b in Tokyo .
O ur dr e a m s are different , but I think we are similar in that we both want to p ur s u e our own dr e a m s .
I wonder what I should give her as a present , so could you give me some a d v ic e ?
F or e i g n b a b y
I can me e t for e i g n er s if I go to the c ity are a in Tokyo , but I w o n ' t be able to me e t a for e i g n b a b y .
It ' s only a d ul t or ch il d re n that I me e t .
I like b a b ies so I ' m always look ing for w ar d to me e t a for e i g n b a b y
He has been living in J a p an for 1 0 year s and he like s to talk with J a p an e se people .
I think our language s k i ll s were even .
He want s his b a b y to speak J a p an e se so he ' s le ar n ing J a p an e se every day .
R e c ent ly , I ' m f as c in at ed with a T V s er ies name d `` How I me t your mother . `` ( T h ough I do n ' t watch it on T V but the In ter ne t because is has n ' t been in t ro d u c ed into T a i w an .
He always make s his own the or y about life !
To day , since people turn out to be more and more r ation al and have high er de m and s about the op po s ite se x , along with an open mind about da ting which has n ur ture d to n s of different re al ity da ting show s .
This show f e a ture s `` P ar ent s da ting G u y s `` .
The pro ce s s is like this , the girl ' s p ar ent s will me e t the guy s first , then they will make the de c is ion for their own d aught er s who , by the way , is not even on the scene about whether they should give this guy a ch ance to go out for a d ate with their d aught er s or not .
I do n ' t understand why so many people are into this stuff , I de c id ed to ar r an g e some n ic e d ate s for my friend s by follow ing my own style .
A d ate that can ex ud e both part ies ' w ar m th and cha ri s m a .
S ound s a little b it trick y ?
With o ut a ud i ence s , l o ve j ud g es , p ar ent s , just a friend ly and p ri v ate at m o s p he re , which all ow s them to be themselves and enjoy the moment .
L a st night was the second d ate ( that ) I ar r an g ed for my friend and ho pe ful ly they can work things out !
play ing the two ro le s
I ' m a e m p l o y e e on a week day and a st ud ent at gradua te school for the three days in a week .
I en ro ll ed the school in A p ri l .
H ar d work is require d some time s , but o b tain ing a new know led g e is n ic e .
I am cha ll e ng ing a ta s k that I have not ever done in the business .
This is also very va l u able to me .
With o ut f a il when there ' s great need , great heart s and mind s ri se up to me e t the cha ll e ng e .
In two month s , my p rofessor will take some students to O h i o un ive r s ity in A m er ic a for a month .
But who m ever want s to go there , must pass the ex a m and in ter v i e w .
G o ing a b ro ad is my dr e a m , so I re ally ch er ish this op p or t un ity .
It is a good ch ance to str e ng th en my know led g e , b ro ad en my ho ri z on , enjoy for e i g n c ust o m s , and also re al i z e my dr e a m .
With o ut any mean s to im p ro ve my poor English I can try speak ing more , listen ing more , read ing more , and so on .
In my opinion , it is a difficult pro ce s s to over c ome myself , but I must insist on do ing my be st , no matter how difficult it is .
On ce you make up your mind , per s ever e in do ing it .
I was s up ri s ed when I found it . I have been study ing English for 2 year s because I want to make a l ot of friend s all over the world .
Yes ter day , K it a j im a K ous u ke who is a b re a st str o ke s w im m er , got the go l d me d al .
He is small er than most people but he did it .
I was very impress ed .
They are i ll um in at ed d ur ing the night .
The to p of the mo un tain was very co l d , even though I was we ar ing s n ow b o ar d g e ar .
I ho pe I do n ' t catch a co l d . : )
W ish ing You H a p p i ness In P ar ad is e
I just listen ed to his b and B o y z on e ' s b ri ll i ant so ng `` No M at ter What `` on the way back home .
S te p h en was c ut e and bra ve but now he is go ne .
When I was in j un i or high school everything seemed b or ing and mean ing less , and I also did poor ly in my st ud ies .
One day , I f a il ed a ne x a m .
A t that time I had no place to go ; my p ar ent s ha ted w h en I under a ch i e v ed but s ud d en ly a f a ir - sound ing voice f l o at ed to my e ar . ' I c a n ' t de n y what I believe , I c a n ' t be what I ' m not . ' I was as t on ish ed by the voice and ly ri c s which c he er ed me up .
You r l o ve ly face looked like a ra y of ho pe .
I wish you ha p p i ness in p ar ad is e .
With know ing come s c ar ing , and with c ar ing there is ho pe that we could make way for a he al th y en v ir on ment that s us tain s us .
[ In depend ent paragraph ] O il has been f l o o d ing the g ul f of M e x ic o for three month s .
[ In depend ent paragraph ] There has been only 1 5 days without w ar since the begin n ing of hu man ity , which mean s an un c o un t able number of people have been k il led and been k il ling at the same time .
[ In depend ent paragraph ] On the other side of the g l o b e , a great number of people live on less than a do ll ar .
C le ar ly , the world is l op s id ed .
W at ch ing C N N and read ing The N e w Y or k T im es , I am s ud d en ly wonder ing how many of us believe we know what ' s going on outside our own little world .
I ' m bu il d ing comp ut er pro g r a m al g or i th m s even when I am dr e a m ing at night , because I ' ve been do ing comp ut er pro g r a m s all day long .
It was n ' t the c or re c t al g or i th m , I am try ing to make a block p u z z le .
The pro g r a m will be p il ing block s up or so r ting them or do ing something else .
F or 1 0 month s , I st ud i ed J a v a and J a p an e se .
It was particular ly difficult to study J a p an e se .
A c t u ally / H on est ly , I wonder ed `` can I do this ? ``
Some time s , I felt f r ust r at ed and de s p a ir ed .
N e x t We d ne s day , the e c on o m ic s se m in ar so f t b a ll ma t ch will take place .
However , the ex pe ri ence of v o ll e y b a ll does not transfer well in so f t b a ll because the for m is different
A n y way , I ' m re ally look ing for w ar d to play the game ! !
I must to read litera ture , which is written in English .
So , I am start ing to le ar n English for the first time in a de c ad e .
I am an a ud it or of a con st r u ction comp an y .
To day the J a p an e se con st r u ction in d ust ry face s a serious c ri s is .
When some on e as k s me , `` What ' s your favor ite thing ? ``
I ' ll respon d , `` My ho b b y is read ing b ook s , ``
In fact , most people , when asked about their ho b b y ,
they would n ' t usual ly answer that they `` l o ve to read b ook s `` .
and ma g a z in es ,
than k s for read ing and f i x ing my wrong sen t ence s , ,
To day was a bu s y day .
I have been work ing no n - stop .
I have to work from 9 : 0 0 a . m . to 1 0 : 0 0 p . m .
You get to ex pe ri ence a l ot of things , like how to us e different kind s of p en s , and me e t a l ot of people , even if they are not always very kind . *
O ur b re a k time is too short .
O h , how wonder ful the co ll e g e life is !
On ce you get into the so c i e ty , your life w on ' ' t be as simple as that in co ll e g e .
A fter each tea m sub m it s it s propos al , there ' s a week for people to v o te for their f a o u v or ite on the we b .
There ' s a f in al p ri z e for the three high est s c or ing tea m s at the end of the con t est . They all can en ro ll for free in a po st g r ad u ate course ( or a language one , if they have n ' t finish ed their de g re e ) .
A d d i tion ally , the first tea m get s to tra ve l to N e w Y or k !
We w on the last t est , and each of the me m b er s of our tea m got a mo b i le p h on e .
As I had just b ough t a M ot or o la M il est on e ( the e ur o pe an ver s ion of D ro id ) , I ga ve it to my father , who ' s act u ally very ha p p y with it , since it ' s a c ut e small No k i a with w if i .
We ' re going first next time , but since they try to give one p ri z e to a different tea m each time , we expect the j ur y to make the one s who are going th ir d w in this time .
But we still ho pe we w in in the end and visit U S A ! !
I went to Tokyo D is ne y R es or t on F e b r u ar y 8 th and 9 th with my bo y f ri en d .
On the first day , we went to Tokyo D is ne y S e a .
We ro d e many at t r a ction s and we did sh op p ing in many kind s of st or es .
It is a new at t r a ction .
On the other hand , C ir qu e d u So le il was such an impress ive show .
We were ex cited at the show !
We enjoy ed so much on this tri p .
I ' m sick of co l d we a ther every day .

We did n ' t talk about the con t ent of the te x t b ook much , but we talk ed a l ot about each other ' s favor ite country , c ity , f o o d and sp e c i al ex pe ri ence s .

But it ' s get ting near to the d ate of my gradua te school t est so , I must work hard to study e ng l ish . I feel str es s ed every day

D ur ing the day I wait ed for the ra in as I looked up at the s k y and I was think ing what the pro ble m with we a ther for e c a st or g an i z ation .

There were 9 0 % which expect ed the ra in to day but they were wrong .
To m or r ow will be sp or t s day at my d aught er ' s school .

The ex a m in ation fee is $ 1 5 0 .
So I want to pass it the first time .
I left my um b re ll a on a train this morning .
A fter work , I went to the st ation ' s los t and found office .
The st ation s ta f f sea r ch ed the re c or d s on the comp ut er for my um b re ll a and found it .

And the teacher was so great to us .

No w I want to dr in k this gr e en tea some time s .
So to day I made gr e en tea by simple pro ce s s .
A fter I made it , I dr an k the gr e en tea .

It was so b it ter .
Why do n ' t I re m e m b er this ta s te ?
But I ' ll make the gr e en tea again .
I ' m going to sen d a me s s age to my friend . . .

You know , the e ar th qu a ke affect ed my family very bad ly .
But my gr and m a is s a f e .
And my c ous in s are also fine .
I p r a y for them to return to normal life ! ]
C a n ' t I say `` f ri ed potatoes `` ? You can .
In the gra m m ar ex er c is es , which I did for hour s ( ? ) I could n ' t c or re c t any sen t ence s ( ? ) .
B e c a us e it is very im p or t ant ; I ' ll never get a good job without it , and I ' ll never understand half of the beautiful sit es in the In ter ne t !
And I like to draw in P h ot o s h op and I ll ust r at or , and many other things !
Some body , who is le ar n ing Russian , and all who want to talk with a Russian girl - let s talk by s k y pe !
To day all of my class m ate s and I went to the H u an g R ive r P ar k .
The H u an g ri ver is the second long est ri ver of C h in a .
As it s name im p l ies , the water is very y e ll ow c ar ry ing l ot s so il .
I re g re t ted we ar ing new c l o th es , when I came back they were full of d ust .
The ri ver is very long . I c a n ' t see the end , and the water is pe a ce ful .
He is c r a w ling every where as his in st in c t tell s .
When he get s s il ence , it is a da ng er ous sign to me .
I put my f ing er s into his little mouth , and p u ll it out .
I tri ed to keep an e y e on him while do ing house work ,
E ver y day he is gr ow ing little by little , s te p by s te p ,
and every day I am le ar n ing how to de al with his can - do things .
S p r ing V a c ation is A l m o st He re !
It ' s been a long time since I w ro te a di ar y ent ry .
My un ive r s ity class es started on J an u ar y 8 th , but they will be over short ly .
T im e f l ies !
When sp r ing va c ation come s , I will have to study English hard er , and I ' d like to write a di ar y ent ry every day .
I would be so ha p p y if you would commen t on my di ar y .
But I s l ept in l ate this morning !
I ' m a b s o l ut e ly get ting up e ar ly ! !
A c t u ally , there are not only three so l u tion s in the ar t ic le , but I just p ic k ed out three so l u tion s .
This will re s ul t in a ra p id ly a g ing so c i e ty with f e w er ch il d re n .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to see ing them !
My life is cha ng ing in N Y .
F or ex amp le , to day I or d er ed some c l o th es on line ( you do n ' t say `` in ter ne t sh op `` ) .
I felt ha p p y !
When I us ed to live in S e o ul I us ed to sh op on line .
There are many pro d u c t s that are c he a p er on line than in re ta il st or es .
A fter I left S e o ul , I stop p ed sh op p ing on line .
I could n ' t believe the cha r g ing me th o d .
It was much e as i er than the K or e an me th o d .
I just need credit c ar d number s , that ' s it !
I was w or ri ed that some body would take my credit c ar d number .
F in ally , I found the off ic i al we b s ite . ( F or what ? )
It made me feel more co m f or t able and s a f e to bu y there .
There is no A & F st or e in K or e a , so people se ll this bra n d .
And is very ex p en s ive ! !
B e c a us e of this ex pe ri ence , I could n ' t stop sh op p ing on A & F we b s ite .
I or d er ed some c l o th es and they are going to sh i p p ed on F E B .
I ' m a little dis a p po in ted with the sh i p p ing sp e ed but it does n ' t matter because I ' m re ally sat is f i ed with the p ri ce s and the de s i g n s .
I ho pe it ar r ive s soon !
My very first di ar y ent ry on L an g - 8
On the first day of 2 0 1 0 , like every other year , I made a new year s re s o l u tion .
B ur this year is a little b it different than the previous year s .
I am p l an n ing to mo ve to a for e i g n comp an y , which mean s my ability to speak and write English should im p ro ve .
So I de c id ed to write an English di ar y as a way to im p ro ve my e ng l ish .
And l u c k i ly , I found T H I S S I T E ! !
I believe that writing an English di ar y will re ally help to im p ro ve my English s k i ll s .
T y p h o on is coming
A big strong ty p h o on is head ed to w ar d s the middle are a of J a p an .
R i g h t now it s ra in ing he a v i ly and a strong w in d is blow ing here , so I close d all sh ut ter s to pro te c t the w in d ow s and re d u ce the no is e .
I ' m a little w or ri ed about whether I ' l ll be able to co m m ut e to my office tomorrow morning or not .
M or e o ver , I should at ten d her feel ing s more once more .
The sit u ation made me re al i z e the im p or t ant things .
F ir st ex pe ri ence
My e le ve n month old so n stood by himself for the first time to day !
However , he started to c ry hard after w ar d .
He must have been s c ar ed that he was stand ing without any help .
My English is very bad .
I do n ' t know any gra m m ar and I ' m afraid to speak English .
In fact , I want to say so many things , but writing in English is very ti r ing .
He ll o ! I ' m sorry to write my di ar y l ate ; (
To day , I s l ept for only two hour s .
So I felt sleep y all day .
Why I stay ed up l ate , because I watch ed l ad ies so c c er game ! The game was between J a p an called `` N ad es h i k o J a p an `` and A m er ic a .
The first half of the game was a draw and the second half of the game was a draw .
The over time game was a draw too ! I was very str a in ed by P K ! I ' m afraid of watch ing P K .
F in ally , J a p an w on the game , so `` N ad es h i k o J a p an `` is to p tea m in the world ! ! I was ex cited , so I could n ' t sleep ; ) But I do n ' t re g re t watch ing so c c er .
I want to play some sp or t s ! T h an k you very much : )
I de c id ed that I will write a di ar y every day at la ng - 8 about da ir y thing to le ar n English .
To day , I took a walk around my house by b ic y c le .
I visit ed a F re e m ar ke t which was he l d at p ar k .
The sound s of ( people ' s ) f o ot s te p s / F o ot s te p s
Yes , I am sp e c if ic ally re f er r ing to my bo s s .
I than k my sh ar p e ar s for ( the s a ke of ) my s ur v i v al unti l now .
So many M M A fight er s think they want to be strong er than they are .
This is the most im p or t ant thing to them but , my opinion is different .
Even if they are strong , they do n ' t w in some time s .
M M A is a sp or t that should n ' t be though of as a re g ul ar sp or t .
There are a fight er s who do n ' t think M M A is a sp or t and when they los e fight s , they see m like they want to k i ll their op p on ent . It go es to show a strong person can los e to a we a k person .
I want to say , there is no future in M M A for just the strong .
F ed or , who is Russian , is not very strong .
Y e t he is name d the one of the be st fight er s in the world .
3 : 2 5 a . m . J S T
It is 3 : 2 5 a . m . J a p an S t and ar d T im e ( J S T ) .
To day , I went to un ive r s ity .
In English class there was a t est : (

But , I ' m going to do it now , because my la p t op is suppose d to get re p a ir ed , and in a co up le of hour s , the me ch an ic is going to be here to p ic k it up .
Well , the reason why I call the re p a ir man is because it has been ma k ing loud no is es and the s c re en of ten make s w a ve s .
It has been about e i g h t month s since I p ur ch as ed it , so any s er v ic e is free .
now here he ' s is .
O k a y right now I want to know what the be st way is to le ar n English a c c ent s ?
S in ce I ' m we a k in understand ing the a c c ent s of a language .
I ho pe some on e here can give me some ti p s or s te p s that I should take in or d er to im p ro ve my co m m un ic ation s k i ll s
One of my friend s , Y o s h im i , in t ro d u c ed me to this we b s ite .

To day , I me t an old friend .
I dr an k be er with her .
I asked her if she had a bo y f ri en d .
She answered , `` Yes , I have a bo y f ri en d . ``

Some day , I will find a girl f ri en d .
My ch ance will sure ly come .
It f e a ture s the he a v y us e of me l ted c he e se , be an s , ch il i and to r t il la s .
The only pro ble m is that it is very he a v y f o o d .
When I have T e x - M e x at l un ch , I c a n ' t eat anything at night . . . .
I am new to la ng - 8 .
E ver y day , I work very hard to le ar n it .
But re c ent ly , I have want ed to speak English .
If I can speak English f l u ent ly some day , I want to go a b ro ad .
And I want to see the wonder ful ar ch ite c ture of for e i g n co un t ri es .
That ' s why , I started le ar n ing English .
I w o ke up e ar l i er than normal to day .
B e c a us e I had a head a ch e and a he a v y st o m a ch .
I thought that was why I felt bad in the be d .
I had a dinner at 1 1 p m yesterday and s l ept as soon as possible .
I did n ' t feel that way before , yet I did the same things .
I am dis a p po in ted that I ' m still not you ng !
We have a three day ho l i day , so I w l ll sp en d the se days play ing .
Yes ter day I got up l ate as usual , and then had l un ch , went to the s up er m a ke t with my good friend , and b ough t something for my family .
Yes ter day was a bu s y day , but I was very ha p p y .
I felt the time pass ed f aster than usual .
I am old er than before .
I have n ' t written here for a long time because I found a job .
It was very difficult work because we have to work over time .
We have many for e i g n er s as our c l i ent s and I re ally could try my str e ng th in English ) It ` s so interest ing to talk with the B ri t ish , G er man s , It al i an s , D an es , F in n s , C ro at s . . .
One D ut ch man always as k us `` How are you ? `` , no body understood him , ex c ept me and I could talk with him for a long time .
It was a difficult , but very interest ing time )
A fter my hard - days I am going to go to M in s k , B el ar us

S um o is one of the tra d i tion al J a p an e se sp or t s .
He has re c ent ly been a c c us ed of p un ch ing a man while dr un k .
A s um o ch amp ion , called a y o k o z un a , is require d to be strong not only physical ly , but also spirit u ally .
He is one of the strong est s um o w re st l er s in s um o history .
He is very f a m ous , as even I know who he is .
A B a c k p a c k er
D ur ing the last s um m er va c ation , I tra ve led around So ut he a st As i a ; M al a y s i a ( M al a c c a and K u al a L um p ur ) , C a m b o d i a ( S i e m R e a p ) , and My an m ar ( B a g an ) .
I me t a J a p an e se back p a c k er when I was in K L .
We became f a st friend s .
He is an ex pe ri ence d back p a c k er .
He said he tra ve led around the world .
I like his tra ve l st or ies es pe c i ally in T ha il and and In d i a .

A c t u ally , every body in my comp an y co un t s on me when it come s to English , for ex amp le when work ing with c ust ome r s or tra n s la ting do c u ment s from the U .
But as you can see , my writing ability is like ch il d s play .
I ' m always dr e a m ing about having my English comp o s i tion s pro o f re ad by n at ive English speak er s .
If you not ic e something , for ex amp le , gra m m at ical er r or s , or un n at ur al express ion s , please tell me .
This time , I tri ed writing a di ar y without us ing my di ction ar y .

It is said that you can be he al th y and ha p p y or your wish will come tru e if you c l im b this mo un tain .
On the to p of mo un tain , there is a sh ri ne bu il t in the 7 0 0 ' s .

We will each pack water , l un ch , and our wish es in our back p a c k s .
B e c a us e it has been ra in ing for 3 days , I made `` T ER U T ER U - B O Z U `` in ho pe s of s un s h in e .
It is an old J a p an e se c ust o m , al th ough only ch il d re n do it in the se days . . .
U s u ally it is hung under the ro o f , but I could n ' t do it .
E ver y on e who j o in ed this class was very good .
Even a middle - a g ed man was better than me !
I am a begin n er .
I made a l ot of mistake s .
H is t or ic ally / in the past * , I am a well p l an n ed person so there are always s ch ed ul es that keep me from do ing anything sp on ta ne ous .
So to speak , there are certain things I have to do almost every day before the s un set s , such as read ing a b ook , watch ing new s , and writing something .
I ro n ic ally , I found myself ha ng ing out with my friend who came here in the e ar ly morning , tak ing a who le day from me . We did st up id things like k il ling f l ies , ma k ing me think of what is more im p or t ant than that .
I am very str es s ed right now .
It was very difficult to say anything so I us ed the wrong w or d s .
so , I spoke English in c or re c t ly .
It was the kind er g ar ten le ve l ~ ~ . .
When I talk , I for g e t what to say .
My gra m m er was wrong too .
I y could only say `` I like ~ I want . . ``
On ly very simple things .
I felt very tired .
They ' re very l o ve ly .
It look s like j e w el ry .
I thought there were about a hu n d r ed th ous and people on the gr ound .
I had never see n so many people , so I was very surprise d : ) .
B y the way , what do you like to do in the s um m er ?
P le a se tell me : D
Yes ter day , I went to H ome D e po t to bu y a b a g of so il and a p l ant er .
I want ed to re po t my ro se s .
The ro se s gr e w and their f l ow er po t s are too small for them .
And also I want ed to so w sweet b as il see d s and or e g an o see d s .
O h , I just re m e m b er ed , I also b ough t a set of start ing p ot s for th o se her b s .
It took a long time to do that but I was ha p p y , because I like ga r d en ing .
a p at i o , not a ga r d en .
I want ed to do so w ing of V i o la s but I did n ' t have enough st ar ting p ot s , so I will go to H ome D e po again tomorrow .
a ) I ' m lack ing the sen s it i v ity need ed to de p ic t whether an express ion is for m al or in f or m al .
b ) I have to have a sen s it i v ity to w ar d s other s , or girl s w o n ' t like me .
I did n ' t like to le ar n English in school two year s a g o .
But , I came to like English because I began think ing by myself .
L an g - 8 is good place for le ar n ing language s , and it give s us enjoy ment .
I ' m able to keep at it .
E s pe c i ally , in the comp an y , there are many re l ation s .
I want to know how people co m m un ic ate with each other in for e i g n co un t ri es .
It does n ' t mean I ' m not do ing well .
I think I c aught a co l d : - (
I took some me d ic in e , but I still feel bad .
Yes ter day , I went to a sh op p ing ma ll called `` D es s er t H i ll s `` and I found a l ot of reason able c l o th es , b a g s , sh o es and so on .
I b ough t a l ot of stuff and walk ed a l ot . . .
My name is E ll a . I ' m C h in e se and my C h in e se name ' s M ome if en .
I work in an e - co m m er ce comp an y .
I like English , but I do n ' t speak in English re g ul ar ly , so my English has been de c l in ing .
I ho pe you can understand this
I was n ' t able to dr in k al c o h o l because of me d ic in e . I want ed to dr in k , though .
But I enjoy ed the dr in k ing part y !
A l th ough I want to write more about it , I am sleep y
B e c a us e he still want ed to play .
I always watch T V on a S at ur day night .
I c a n ' t watch T V on week day s B e c a us e I am work ing .
I like come d y story and history story .
To day , I enjoy ed a T V pro g r a m about little bo y ' s and girl ' s first er r and s .
The ir p ar ent s sen d them on their first er r and .
It was a little b it ex p en s ive for me , but I was so ha p p y to get it .
I c ar ry it every where , and show it to my friend s .
I de c id ed that I ' d man age it care ful ly to not b re a k it .
Some time s , When I get back from co ll e g e , I feel that I can do a b s o l ut e ly nothing but watch a mo v i e .
I feel so ex ha ust ed but I can not sleep because If I s l ept then when I w a ke up , I ' d have to start study ing again or go to co ll e g e .
E p it ome of C o o l
He re is the end ing .
The after qu a ke is still happen ing in J a p an , Ka n t o are a .
But the st u ation is being re c o ver ed by help not only from other J a p an e se but also from co un t ri es all over the world .
U n f or t un ate ly , we c a n ' t say there is no pro ble m at the F u ku s h im a re a c t or .
I am going to mo ve out to S a it a m a ( in the Ka n t o are a ) from where I c ur r ent ly live just because I study at the un ive r s ity in S a it a m a .
I ' m very w or ri ed about the ra d i ation .
We do n ' t know when the sit u ation will re c o ver per f e c t ly .
The w or st thing in the world is sit ting in a room with only your p en and watch ing the time go away
P r a y for me : D : D
R e ad ing B ook s in the B a th
My favor ite time is when I read b ook s while tak ing a bath !
I usual ly take a bath for more than half an hour .
I think read ing about other s ' l o ve affair s does n ' t make any sen se for me .
I like the st or ies that are un e x pe c ted / s ur p ri s ing , like a ro ll er - co aster .
I expect ed an e ar th qu a ke would o c c ur while I was was h ing my face in the morning .
I ' m so n er v ous about e ar th qu a ke s .
I p re p ar ed an e m er g en c y b a g in case .
And I have to f i x my f ur n i ture s to p re v ent from s l i p p ing .
It was very n ic e .
We walk ed around the ga r d en , we saw the an im al s and different s tree s ; we had a small l un ch
I like ma k ing a p l an , but I c a n ' t follow my p l an .
I think I ' m a la z y person , so I ten d to ch o o se an easy way out .
I want to do many things in one day .
On the other hand , I think I sp en d too many hour s us ing the comp ut er .
It is f un indeed , but it is a was te of time for me .
If I stop c he c k ing sit es so of ten , I think I can s a ve more time .
I need to re c on s id er how I us e / man age my time .
T h ough I ' m not good at man a g ing my time at all , I want to try to be good at it .
I will make a good s ch ed ul e which I will follow .
I want to have strong er mind to keep my s ch ed ul e , and I want to con t ro l my time , not let time con t ro l me .
H i every on e it ' s been a while since I w ro te my last di ar y here .
On F ri day I was S c re a m and on S at ur day I was a b l on d ha ir ed girl .
It re m in d ed me of a high school f est i v al .
What I found through c l u b ing as a girl is that some guy s are so dis g ust ing ! !
E s pe c i ally one guy who tri ed to dance with me was so dis g ust ing ! !
He was get ting too close and to u ch ing my as s with his le g even though I ' m a man .
The c l u b had some small st age s and I was da n c ing on it then a guy came to dance with me .
A fter 5 or 1 0 minute s of da n c ing , at last he not ic ed that I was a man .
He was like ' O M G ! ! ' n he l d his head .
A n y way I enjoy ed it a l ot ! !
I was ted too much time watch ing You t u b e .
I watch ed without any re al de s i re to watch .
P o l it ical one s of ten are full of ch il d ish s w e ar ing .
I was interest ed in how they explain the b ook which I read f e w year s a g o ( in J a p an e se ) only the begin ing and ga ve up .
The se over s i g h t s are some time s ma s s ive .
`` E x i le `` is the one of the most f a m ous v o c al gr o up s in J a p an .
But to day , I ' ll in t ro d u ce to you a very ra re un it `` O k a x i le `` .
And he le ad s the dance in this so ng .
He has a funny and interest ing dance .
You can c he c k other v id e o s of O k a x i le .
It ' s been a while since I w ro te a di ar y on la ng - 8 .
Well , _ I ' m into R a y C h ar le s ' s so ng _ `` H it the R o ad J a c k `` _ re c ent ly .
This You t u b e v id e o has such a good s y m p h on y of m us ic and such good im age s .
B y the way , _ what can I say when something is very good ?
I im a g in e only `` co o l `` or `` a w es ome `` or `` do pe `` .
P le se tell me if there are any other of ten - us ed w or d s that mean `` very good . ``
There are only 1 0 days left of this year .
T im e f l ies like an ar r ow .
This year , I have take n up the cha ll e ng e of le ar n ing English again .
It is re ally than k s for my w if e , who has started le ar n ing English .

L u c k i ly , I have some K or e an friend s so I work ed on it while as k ing
my friend s whether the translation is c or re c t or not .
I was re ally re ally c a ut i ous at tra n s la ting this because it ' s a n ation al
this is just an ex c us e .
A n y way I did my be st and finish ed .
K e e p ing a di ar y is difficult for me .
I want to keep a di ar y every day , but it is not a simple thing for me .
I think my English ability is poor , so than k you very much for your a d v ic e .
It was a mar g he ri ta p i z z a .
I like c he e z e and a b as il .
I want to eat it again some day .
We sat in out d o or sea t s .
To day , it is hot and the s un is sh in ing
So , I got s un b ur n ed a little .
I feel s um m er will come soon in J a p an .
I like w in ter more than s um m er .
So , I ho pe that s um m er will pass quick ly .
S t r an g e J a p an e se c ust o m s ?
A n interest ing T V show a ir ed last S at ur day .
One of them is dr in k ing al ch o le al c o h o l outside , because most co un t ri es do n ' t see m to all ow this .
It is not a s m ar t be ha v i or in J a p an either , but we have a big f us s once a year outside .
D ur ing that sea s on , no one pay s much at ten tion even we are dr un k , and make no is e .
The next moment we rather become friend s with other gr o up s that are enjoy ing themselves around us .
In J a p an , there are strange c ust o m s as me n tion ed a b o ve , like ha n a m i .
D ur ing ha n a m i , we have to find a place before start ing .
It see m s to be high est p ri or ity .
So , when ever I pass by , I am sure they must be new e m p l o y e es .
To day , my country is ra in ing .
It was very hot and dr y .
U n f or t un ate ly , we have to finish ter m ex a m in ation s .
I can not come on here for around 2 week s .
If a t est is over , I will come again .
He has work ed as a c ust ome r s er v ic e re p re s ent at ive about in s ur ance .
So he will try to study something in that time .
But he has no idea what he should study .
A t the moment , the J a p an e se e c on o m y is bad
We are conc er n ed about los ing our job s .
If he los es his c ur r ent job , he would n ' t know what to do .
No w , the W i i is at my house .
The re c ent T V game is am a z ing .
It is very con ve n i ent that it s c or d less .
B y the way , do you know ' L u c k y T a x i ' ?
Yes ter day , I took a tax i , the dr ive r give me a c ar d . ( picture )
It was a somewhat ha p p y day .
A re the se sen t ence s c or re c t ?
C h il d re n c ry to get / at t r a c t their mother ' s at ten tion
To day , I had a l ot of free time .
So , I thought about what I would do .
Then , I re m e m b er ed a very im p or t ant thing .
That my room was very me s s y , because I ' v been bu s y re c ent ly .
So , I work ed very hard to c le an my room .
I was re ally tired after w ar d s .
T `` it was a cha ll e ng ing time .
It ' s easy for me to study .
I do n ' t like s c i ence as well .
I went back home .
I then went to the p ar k .
I enjoy ed play ing so c c er and b a se b a ll with my friend s .
It may ra in at any moment .
P le a se l en d me a p en to write with .
I ' m no long er s up ri s ed about that sit u ation .
A ll I want to know is the reason why they could n ' t come to my c al s s .
I asked some on e about the reason why they were not here .
He ex p l an ed the reason in S w a h il i , so I was n ' t able to understand , but I re al i z ed that they were being p un ish ed .
D o you re m e m b er my j o ur n al ent ry that I w ro te 2 days a g o ?
To day ' s class is the same class which I was n ' t able to tea ch them because of C H O T A M A J I .
T an z an i an students are different from K or e an students .
When I was in K or e a , if we s k i p p ed the class because of other affair s , they seemed very ha p p y .
However , in here , my students do n ' t want to s k i p the class .
When ever I have a class at night ( act u ally , some time s we have an ex t r a class at night like to day ) , I was sat is f i ed with my students who listen ed de v o ur ing every w or d .
So I have to di g out my first M P 3 ( 1 G B ) out from my draw er .
Well , it c a n ' t sat is f y me .
And I f e ll in l o ve with the l i b r ar y at our school ! ! !
I always stay there for a long time
B y the way , listen ing to m us ic there is also a good ch o ic e ~ ( ha , ha )
D o you take n a p s ?
I us ed to lie down on the so f a after eat ing .
R e c ent ly I read a b ook about di g es tion .
A ccord ing to the b ook , tak ing a n a p is not good for di g es tion .
It say s that even if we are sleep y after l un ch , we should not sleep .
If we get very sleep y , we should go for a walk to for g e t about our sleep i ness .
F in ally I de c id ed to try it .
A fter l un ch to day , I brought the b ook to the so f a and began to read it .
But two hour s la ter I found I had been sleep ing for that time .
A fter all that , I went to sleep to day too .
I wonder if I will be able to stay up tomorrow .
My s is ter took entrance ex a m s a f e w days a g o , and she ' s wait ing for her re s ul t s .
My brother will take it this F ri day .
My s is ter is at a un ive r s ity , my brother is in high school .
F ir st , I can see some mo ve ment s of people s who have re c o ver ed from the da m age now .
When the e ar th qu a ke had happen ed , the e c on o m ic act i v ity was strong ly de p re s s ed .
We thought that it was not good to have sat is f i ed days when people in the da m age d are a have s u f f er ed .
A l th ough that , we have already re al i z ed that the s ta g n ant e c on o m y was even w or st for the re c o ver y of the To h o ku are a .
F or in st ance , the us age s of the are a con ta m in at ed by the n u c le ar en er g y are now dis c us s ed on the J a p an e se new s p a p er s f re qu ent ly .
I ho pe J a p an will re c o ver from this sit u ation and re p ly on other co un t ri es for their help s in the future .
J a p an ' s en er g y po l ic y
B e c a us e of the great big e ar th qu a ke on M ar ch 1 1 th , J a p an e se en er g y po l ic ies have change d dr a st ic ally .
M an y people claim that `` We should not us e n u c le ar p ow er p l ant s ! ! ``
It ' s tru e that ra d i ation im p a c t s people , ve g e t able s , so il , a ir and the sea .
However , I do n ' t think that n u c le ar p ow er p l ant s should be stop p ed im m ed i ate ly .
If we c a n ' t us e e le c t ri c ity to the full ex t ent , e le c t ri c ity fee s will in c re a se and some c or p or ation s might de c id e to mo ve their fact or ies to a for e i g n country .
If that happen s , J a p an ' s e m p l o y ment ra te will face great difficult y .
M o st J a p an e se people c a n ' t speak English .
So if we los e our e m p l o y er s , we c a n ' t get job s !
A fter that , we can change our e le c t ri c ity so ur ce into a natural one .
We should n ' t change our en er g y po l ic y if we c a n ' t do it s a f e ly .
This is like the thing which J a p an e se w ive s of ten say : `` W h i ch is more im p or t ant ? M e or your work ? ! `` .
It ' s the same kind of question .
She always answer s in c or re c t ly at the same question s that I had t aught s ever al time s , like a ne g at ive number m ul t i p l i ed by a ne g at ive number is a po s it ive number .
She just c as u ally answered the question s and so r t of appeared im p at i ent , which made me so r t of a ng ry .
Y e t , I have re f le c ted on my be ha v i or back home .
I had heard of it before but I ' ve never play ed it and neither had any one over there .
A fter play ing be er po ng , many people play ed with it but a funny thing happen ed on that day .
T w o guy s were comp e ting against each other , ra c ing in an a th l etic game .
N e i ther of them knew how ex a c t ly to run in the game .
One of the guy tri ed to run by l if ting up his k ne es a l ot and the other s did not .
A c t u ally , it require s l if ting up their k ne es high enough to make the K in e c t sen s or to sen se their mo ve , so he was c or re c t and had f a st est sp e ed in the ra ce .
However , the pro ble m is he was a b it too serious so he started mo v ing to w ar d the T V mo n it or little by little , then f in ally he s l i p p ed on a floor and f e ll down .
As a re s ul t , s ud d en ly he became 7 th in the ra ce which is the second from last .
