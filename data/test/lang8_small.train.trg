It was such hard work

I had a good time . ( S ound s more natural . ) "
I began to  le ar n English when I was about  1 6 year s old
I have had English for about four year s e ng l ish now
F or four week s I was in the  U K to  le ar n English
I was in C a m b ri d g e and  le ar n ed a l ot
The school I was in was the  st ud i o school
S in ce last year , I have had a re ally bad English teacher
In my opinion , my English s k i ll s have de c re as ed since I have had this teacher
So I began to  le ar n  J a p an e se by myself
I  le ar n ed more  J a p an e se then English last year
I don ' t have a  J a p an e se teacher , but I think I  le ar n ed more  J a p an e se than English since I have had this English teacher
A t the moment , I can write all the  k an a and about  2 0 0  k an j i
But just the mean ing s and how to write them
I think it ' s e as i er to  le ar n s te p by s te p
So I  le ar n the  v o c a b ul ar y , gra m m ar , and the mean ing s of the  k an j i
A l s o , I listen to  J a p an e se P o d 1 0 1
It ' s very help ful because I don ' t have a  J a p an e se teacher
The pro no un c i ation is very difficult to  le ar n without any on e who can speak  j a p an e se
While I am  le ar n ing  J a p an e se , I don ' t want to for g e t English , so I write here to  im p ro ve e ng l ish
My English teacher can ' t re ally help me
I am a f f r a id that I am not good enough to write in  J a p an e se
I just can only speak some short sen t ence s like  ' ? ?

this was not what I was going to write
So , see you then !"
? P R ? M y be st friend ' s b and is re le as ing their ma j or de b ut  al b um on  4/ 2 1
He is one of my be st friend s
We went to the same school and had been in the same class for five year s
I w ro te a  j o ur n al  ent ry about him and his b and a while a g o
A t that time , I asked you for some help for the name of the ma j or de b ut  al b um on his be h al f
He ho pe s his so ng s will be the f i re and w ar m th in your heart
E n j o y ing our live s is   " an  "  im p or t ant thing
But while we live in   " a  " each  n ation s , there are respon s i b il it ies and  o b l i g ation s
I re ally   " ha ve to  " re f le c t   " up  " on myself about this ."
The sub j e c t was   " I s it possible that each of the people all over the world to us e the same am o un t of  en er g y that a  J a p an e se us es now
A t no dis t ant future a time may come when people will us e up all the  o il
But if the b la d e is da m age d by  light n ing and need s re p la ce ment , the w in d must be s light enough to under ta ke the re p a ir work s a f e ly
This mean s that  op er at ing a w in d p ow er  g en er at or require s con st ant and p ow er ful w in d but it must be stop p ed per i o d ic ally
So I think I should go to be d a b it than e ar l i er to night
I will write more about the  en er g y pro ble m some time soon
I have a p po in t ment with do c t or tomorrow morning
So I have to finish it to night and leave him to turn it tomorrow morning
I have n ' t dinner yet
S or ry that I ' ve been un able to c or re c t your  j o ur n al s the se days . (   ; ? ; `
So c or re c ting your  j o ur n al  ent ri es from that comp ut er is re ally hard to do . (   ?
So I ' m think ing I will b r ing the  la p t op comp ut er which I usual ly us e at home to the  la b , and leave it there for some time
F ur ther m or e , my gradua tion re se ar ch could be a kind of s im ul ation stuff , I think . ( S or ry , don ' t know what you are try ing to say
Y E S
But I de c id ed to do it to s a ve my money
But it ' s go n n a be much more p ow er ful than the one s made by man u f a c ture r s
I ' m think ing of us ing some w i re she l ve s which I ' ve kept outside
They are co ver ed bad ly with  r ust so bad
I have a B B Q and hi k ing ( t o do ) this week en d

He also place d many temple s and  J a p an e se style ga r d en s under the F e ng - S u i style
T h ough many of  J a p an e se are not a w ar e of it
I was at the   " T a c o s P ar ty  " last night

The second picture is of the hand m ad e ti r a m is u
One of them had the b ir th day re c ent ly had his / h er b ir th day
It was not only  ta c o s part y , but also her b ir th day part y
It ' s been a week since the last time I w ro te a  j o un al
L a st T h ur s day , I was present at the part y . L a st T h ur s day , I went to a part y
That part y was a im ed for  le ar n i g English con ver s ation ! The part y was to help us p r a c t ic e English con ver s ation
This The se kind of part ies are he l d per i o d ic ally
But this was my first time to take part in one
And I wait ed for them about  3 0 minute s under in the co l d we ther
We could dr in k as much many dr in k s as we want ed
I dr un k l it ter s d r an k l it re s of G in and To n ic
We only j ust had English con ver s ation s
But also it was f un to talk with  J a p an e se people who are interest ed in English
I for g ot about that this was my f ir t st time and enjoy ed speak ing English
T h o se picture s were take n at there
I am the guy who is a c c id ent ally  k is s ing with the  4 2 year old guy in the second picture . )
A r ound  2 2 : 3 0 , people started  le aving . if not they were mi s s ing the last train s . I f they did n ' t , they would mi s s the last train s
Then we m o v ed to the next place
We walk ed about  1 0 or  2 0 minute s with a str a g g er ing ly ! L o l  -  i don ' t know what you ' re saying here !
We talk ed about many funny things ( m o st ly in d e c ent things ) at there
We stay ed at there unti l morning
I have T O E I C  t est in a month s
I did n ' t write a  j o ur n al  ent ry last night . p ( ? ? ) q
But the comp ut er which was provide d for me by the  la b was re ally s l ow
I tri ed to un in st a ll some a p p l ic ation s and did a  v ir us c he c k ( t o o ) . ( I t will sound more natural if you a d d   " t o o  " at the back of your sen t ence
It took a co up le of hour s . ( This is a set p h r a se ,   " a co up le of  . . .  " ,   " a set of . . .  " ,   " a do z en of . . .  " e t c e t c
Then the works h op started
When I got to home , it was ( al re ad y ) past  1 0 p . m . ( > ? <
I still could write a  j o ur n al  ent ry but I was too ex ha ust ed
I need to be more s te ad y
And sleep s for only an hour
He say s his be d is too co m f or t able so
He might sleep for more than an hour if he sleep s in the be d
I don ' t know if an hour is enough for me
I feel pro ud of  J a p an ' s c ul ture
I also feel s ad for the los se s of that c ul ture
The G o l d en We e k start s tomorrow
There are many different the or ies regard ing what mo t ive ate s hu man being s to act in the way s in the what they do
I agree with the l at ter position because all hu man so c i e t al act i v it ies are direct ly or in d i re c t ly in v o l v ed with other people around us .  ? ?
U l t im ate ly any kind of hu man a ction s are is mo l d ed by affect ion to from other s
And I ' m in the middle of the  se ction about   " I n t ro d u ction .  " he he ! ( ? ? )
No w I ' m writing a paper about the c ur r ent s state and f ut e ur e pro s pe c t s of the  en er g y s up p r ly in  J a p an
? ? ! ^^ ? ?
The more I  le ar n , the more  o b v i ous it is that the de ve l op ment of the  n u c le ar p ow er p l ant is reason able
? ? ! ^^
But ,   " H as te make s was te s !  " ,  " S ta y c al m !  " and   " B e co o l !  " "
M o st of people say  E m in e m is one of the co ar s est ra p p er s in the history of  m us ic because of his be ha v i or , w or d s and his so ng s which are  st ud d ed with in s ul t s
He has put a f f ro n t s upon a f f ro n ted / in s ul ted many  ce le b ri t ies in his so ng s such as M ic ha el  J a c k s on ,  E l v is P re s le y and even his ex - w if e .   " P ut a f f ro n t s upon  " might not be in c or re c t ( I did n ' t c he c k ) but it sound s a w k w ar d
A so ng which is in on his  3 r d  al b um , however , show s those of his in s ul t s might be not his re al intention . I think people usual ly say that a so ng is on an  al b um , not in it
This so ng which you might have not heard of is name d   " H a i le y ' s So ng
H a i le y  " is his d aught er ' s name
P le a se turn off or put your  ce ll p h on e into s il ent mo d e while watch ing the show  m us ic  v id e o . ( I think   " s h ow  " is for something long er  -- like a T V pro g r a m
the   " H a i le y ' s So ng
There is a hu g e for est where no one can  t re s p as s on it s ho ly gr ound in the middle of a c a p it al c ity which is well - k n ow n world w id e
The p ri est is a direct de s c en d ant of the the world ' s old est d y n as ty , and he is also the only e m p er or who ex is t s in the who le world now
There are three ho ly d ur able s called   " The T h re e S a c r ed T re as ur es
T h o se are own ed by the e m p er or and have been pass ed from  g en er ation to  g en er ation
E a ch of them is being  g u ar d ed close ly at the an c i ent s an c t u ar ies and they are regard ed un t o u ch able
The  g i g ant ic c ity it s el f has also been close ly pro te c ted by  la y er ed ma g ic s by a sub l im e w i z ar d since it was  est a b l ish ed
So it is an  ar t if ic i al c ity de f en d ed by ma g ic
It is of un p re c ed ent ed s c al e and no other such c ity is long er in ex is t ence , even in the c r ad le of the ma g ic ."
sea she p ar d
I feel like they are do ing such things just for f un ( on ly
The F ir st thing that I want to e m p ha s i z e is there is no di f f er ence  between a w ha le and a co w
B i o l o g ic ally they are both class if i ed as ma m m al s
D o you think it can be us ed as a reason to not  k i ll it / th e m
We have the c ul ture to a p p re c i ate ( ? ) all live s e qu ally
A p ri l  1 st is the day which called know n as A p ri l F o o l s ' D a y
But I am not going to be a fool in this  j o ur n al
A p ri l is the begin n ing of school sea s on
I gradua ted from  N a g o y a  U n ive r s ity and got the de g re e of Bachelor of  E ng in e er ing last month
No w I ' m going to gradua te school at  N a g o y a  U n ive r s ity
I  le ar n ed many things d ur ing last year
They were not only sp e c i al know led g es . I also  le ar n ed more than just a c ad e m ic s
My a im of for this year is   " le ar n a l ot , and play a l ot  " by us ing e f f ic i ent time man age ment !"
M id ter m s are f in ally over with ! ( W h en you say   " I am over with mi d ter m s  " , this act u ally mean s   " I am f ed up with mi d ter m s !  " and   " I will never study for / w ri te a mi d ter m  ever again !  " What I w ro te is close r to what you mean t , I think
F in ally , the mi d - ter m s are done over now
But not for this year
This year , it mean s , f in ally I can f in ally f o c us on my re se ar ch
How about ,   " O p t im i z ation of str ate g ic ma in ten ance of e le c t r ical e qu i p ment s  " ?
I have no idea how to so l ve / g o about do ing this yet
I have only  5 month s to finish this
So I have no time to re po se ! [ A l th ough ,   " re po se  " work -- it sound s  o d d in every day language . I think a better w or d to us e would be   " re st
I have n ' t to u ch ed my e le c t r ical e le c t ro n ic di ction ar y the se days
This mean s I have n ' t us ed English the se days for some time .
L e ar n ing English is un a v o id able for my future . ( I t ' s a b it a w k w ar d to us e   " no t a v o id able  " where you can us e   " un a v o id able  " I M H O
I have to sp en d more time on  le ar n ing / m y English ! ( This sound s more natural to me ) "
It has been re ally co l d unti l last week
In the middle of A p ri l , It ' s usual ly w ar m enough to go out with we ar ing only a long - s le e v ed shirt or some time s a c as u al  j a c ke t over here
But on the day of last week , it was so co l d that I need ed to we ar a down  j a c ke t even though it ' s already sp r ing ! ( I think an ex c la m ation mar k is more s u it able here  ; p
To day , the p rofessor of the  en er g y tra n s f or m ing e ng in e er ing class told us some of his do u b t s on  g l o b al w ar m ing
He de s c ri b ed it from the view po in t s of the number of the s un s po t s , the a x is of the e ar th and the e ar th ' s year ly sp in s
He said that the e ar th is f a c ing a  g l o b al co o ling now ( in s te ad of  g l o b al w ar m ing ) . ( I t will make your sen t ence more comp le te if you a d d the b l u e w or d s behind
He said it will in d u ce a rather co o l s um m er all over the world
The we a ther for e c a st said tomorrow is go n n a be co l d
I just can ' t wait for the  n ic e w ar m sp r ing !"
We took part in it under the  Y F U , ( th e co m m a here make s the sen t ence e as i er to understand ) which was the ex change or g an i z ation that took care of me while I was stay ing in A m er ic a
I have been told that we were suppose d to explain the act i v it ies of the  Y F U to students who were interest ed in study ing a b ro ad
We have he l d such a meeting last month
So we thought that this would pro ce ed as easily as last month ' s meeting
But it was n ' t / d id n ' t
A c t u ally this even t was like a kind of ex t r a c ur ri c ul ar act i v it ies to the  high s ch o o l girl s
There were a l ot of other or g an i z ation s such as the gr o up of  J a p an e se dr um play er s , the we l f ar e work er s and a  ri v al or g an i z ation that is called A F S
But all of them were most ly for people who want ed to study a b ro ad
So the con t ent s of s l id e show / p re s ent ation which we p re p ar ed were most ly about how to a p p ly for the  Y F U ex change pro g r a m , the history of the  Y F U and the str u c ture of the or g an i z ation
So it was a serious  ty pe of thing and was n ' t a f un thing at all
The  ri v al or g an i z ation , A F S , on the other hand , was do ing re ally f un stuff
We to t ally mi s un d er st o o d the purpose of the even t
We felt as if we were  ly ing on a be d of  th or n s ."
L a st S at ur day , we he l d a C h ri st m as P ar ty for the ex change students
There were  n in e ex ch age students stay ing in the To k a i are a through  Y F U
Y F U is the one of the world ' s large st ex change or g an i z ation s
T h re e year s a g o , I went to A m er ic a for a year as an ex change  st ud ent through  Y F U
I re ally a p p re c i ate to them
So , to re p la y and express my feel ing of gra t it ud e , I ' m work ing for  Y F U as a volunteer now
The se ex change students are return ing to their home l and h ome at the begin n ing of next month
So we want ed them to have one more another p re c i ous me m or y of  J a p an  < t o take home with them
That was why we he l d the  ch ri st m as part y
A previous  Y F U ex change  st ud ent now run s a c a f e in  N a g o y a , he let us us e his ha ll for the part y
It was a re ally  n ic e place
It had a  n ic e in ter i or with co o l draw ing s pai n ted all over the wall s
M a y b e the se are draw n by themselves th e y were original s
O ver  3 0 people came to the C h ri st m as part y , it was l o ve ly
The for e i g n ex change students bra ng their friend s  - their  age ra ng ed from my  age to over  5 0
We provide d them with many s n a c k s  , j u ic es and  J a p an e se tra d i tion al f o o d like T e m a k i - S us h i
We had a game called   " Russian  ro ul e t te was a b i c re a m p u f f

A fter game , w e enjoy ed cha t ting with each other and the ha ll run g with the sound of laugh ter
One of the ex change students had a b ir th day on that day
So we  ce le b r at ed her  1 7 th b ir th day with a very c ut e b ir th day c a ke
I ho pe we made an un f or g e t t able me m or y for them
I want to than k every on e who help ed make this such success ful part y .

L a st week we re c i e v ed a his he al th s c re en ing re p or t , and it show ed some un us u al  n um er ical va l u es . * No te : You r sen t ence s were fine , but I might write the two sen t ence s this way
It show ed some un us u al  n um er ical va l u es
The do c t or said he has the me ta st as is sp re ad of can c er of all around his  body
The do c t or also said his days are number ed ,  3 month s at the most
I ' m re ally pro ud of him . my gr and p a
He has give n me a l ot of help in life
When I ho p ed to study a b ro ad in A m er ic a , he was the one who a p p ro v ed and pai d all of the ex p en se s
He also pai d my  t u i tion fee s , and what ' s more he is s aving to p re p ar e for my gradua tion school fee s
When I got back from one year of study ing a b ro ad , I visit ed my gr and p ar ent s first
He took one look at me , and s ud d en ly he  st or m ed about my ha ir co l or
C an you  y e ll at the gr and s on you have n ' t see n for a who le year
He could n ' t over l ook that I seemed to have  change d my  id ent ity and los t my p ri d e in being  J a p an e se
So next day , I had my ha ir c ut re ally short , and d y ed it black
Then I visit ed them again and apologize d
B e c a us e I think it is part of the  J a p an e se  id ent ity
He brought me up
I have never face d such a sit u ation before , that some on e who is re ally close to me is d y ing
A t first , I kind of los t my gra s p of what I was f a c ing
I could n ' t think of what I should tell him
S t r an g e ly enough I have n ' t been  ter ri b ly gr i e v ed this week
B e c a us e I was too bu s y with my un ive r s ity stuff and other work I ' m respon s i ble for
I re ally a p p ri c i ate what he has give n me
