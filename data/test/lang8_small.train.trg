Today's story is \"a bear cat walking on two legs

They don't like to talk about the same things
I felt very funny
We had a good time."

Does the sentence I wrote above make sense? yes! but just a grammatical error with \"despite
I can't help but think of him although I decided not to chase him anymore. [Don't you think these sentences are the same
I stopped chasing him
but I can't stop thinking about him."
Therefore I'd like to go to another school

And, I went to buy a hair care product and a snack
Finaly, I went to Starbucks coffee and drank coffee, ate a cookie and wrote letter to my boyfriend

It was kind of a farewell party for her
The bar was very crowded because every drink was only $2
And It was so much fun
I drank too much and got drunk though
But it's ok because we had a really great time together
However, we are so sad that she left here
I hope I see her again soon."
And I attended the Orientation today
I'm looking foward to going to school
Finally I came back!! (would be better to say \"Finally I am back
I haven't come been (on) here for a looooong time... (you're original sentence was understandable, but this is a little bit more like something an American would say
Because writing by English is really hard for me and I'm kind of busy
Actually, I've just been was just lazy, hahaha
But I really wanna improve my English because I can only stay US just for half a year
That's a very short time. I don't wanna leave, but I can't do anything about it
After going back to Japan, I'm sure I don't won't have any chance to use English
Because in Japan, most of people are Japanese. (or you could say, \"...most people speak Japanese.\" Just a suggestion, it's a little clearer). 
I hope I can make friends from overseas though
I have been live living in the United States from since last month as an Au Pair
Here is a very good place, the sky is blue and wide, there is a lot of green and it is the climate that it is makes it easy to spend here time outside

I would be happy to receive your corrections
It is now 2011
A lot happened last year
I'm going to graduate from university and enter a company
I'm going to work in an asset management company
It seems like it will be difficult
I'm required to use English in the company,so I need to study harder
Thank you for reading this entry\/article
I would be glad if you would correct this
I like reading books
I have read it several time in English to study English
Do you know “The little prince” story
The little prince lives in a small planet. There are two small volcanoes and a rose
He waters the rose and protects it from cold weather
And prince decides go away from the rose
Then I wondered what the rose means on prince’s planet
And I checked it on the internet
Her name is コンスエロ
It's because サン＝テグジュペリ’s family doesn't like her
Then someone found a lot of letters, pictures, and a lot of stuff in a big サン＝テグジュペ’s trunk
He died by a planned accident
When he died, he was wearing a bracelet with the stamp of コンスエロ
So he loved her so much
On July 25 (または the 25th of July), there was festival in Osaka
It is famous for fireworks
So my friend and I went to see it
The festival was near the river so it sounded nice to go to
But it was difficult seeing some fireworks because some buildings were in the way
So we went around to find a better spot
We were able to see some good fireworks
And there were many foreigners who came to watch
I talked to a foreigner who is from Taiwan
and we became friends
We will meet again at another festival
It was nice to meet him (her?)."
I have been to LA in US on this New year
When I arrived at LAX, I rented a car at the Dallar rentcar (rental car?) shop
After an hour later, I had a flat tire
and I needed to change my car
I called the rent-car (rental car?) office and the officer said \"You should return here and you can change it to another car
Where are you?\" thatwhy. (I'm not sure about this part, maybe that is why
I could not change the flat tire to a spare tire
He is supposed to send somebody to my place
I did not know where I am
I asked the neighbor who was walking nearby
And I could change the flat tire to the spare tire by Road Server and return to the shop
I could switch the car to another car
I thought I would need a navigation system on the car
Finally I could meet my friend 
at LA."
I begin to like baseball games.(この意味、たぶん。。。）
I went to see a baseball game with some of my friends at KOUSHIEN
I didn’t like baseball until I watched the game
That why,  we were singing a song, when the players were standing at the butter box. (batter box
all player has each song  one of player had a homeback hit
The team we were rooting for won.(rooting for = supporting, hoping would win)"
the title is “The beauty and the beast”
It is famous for everyone in the world
Most  of people know it
Then I have examined it searched for its related information on the internet
One of it said the story makes originated from Greece the Greek myth 
The story has a maxim
That is you should believe your feeling instead of what you are seeing"
My trip to Tokyo
I have been to Tokyo
I sometimes visit to there
and almost same schedule. (?)(*Not sure what you are trying to say 
I have a lunch at Tsukuji market to eat sushi. (Not to sure why your capitalising these words
In that time I tried to eat KAISEN-DON
One of my friends recommended it to me but I was a little about trying it. regret. 
It is good. Is o.k, however, 'I did enjoy it though'. would be a better sentence
but I like sushi better than kaisendon
And When I was back to in my home town in of Osaka
I saw a girl who seemed to have a be in problem
May I help you
She said she was is from Australia
Therefore, as we were on the same when we took train, I was tried to speak with her, 
When I was travelling overseas to travel
I sometimes have got to help from local people
I am so thankful for their help
That's why
I want to help other people who seems to be in need of help too. problem."
Ｉ had a chance to talk with a customer from Korea
He could speak English, so then, I tried to ask “Would you like to have a cup of coffee or tea?\" 
But the person sitting next to me, a Japanese businessman, interpreted my English to English. 
I was disappointed
I need to keep practicing my English speaking."
festival in the neighborhood
We had made a festival by ourselves at elementary school
There were so many shops and gameplace game stalls such as Takoyaki, Yakisoba, Oden and Frankfurters
such as Takoyaki,Yakisoba,Oden,Frankfurter. (Combined with last sentence
and We had a were responsible for selling Tonjiru, which is a Japanese-soup
It was such hard work
But many children seemed happy
I had a good time. (Sounds more natural.)"
I began to learn English when I was about 16 years old
I have had English for about four years english now
For four weeks I was in the UK to learn English
I was in Cambridge and learned a lot
The school I was in was the studio school
Since last year, I have had a really bad English teacher
In my opinion, my English skills have decreased since I have had this teacher
So I began to learn Japanese by myself
I learned more Japanese then English last year
I don't have a Japanese teacher, but I think I learned more Japanese than English since I have had this English teacher
At the moment, I can write all the kana and about 200 kanji
But just the meanings and how to write them
I think it's easier to learn step by step
So I learn the vocabulary, grammar, and the meanings of the kanji
Also, I listen to JapanesePod101
It's very helpful because I don't have a Japanese teacher
The pronounciation is very difficult to learn without anyone who can speak japanese
While I am learning Japanese, I don't want to forget English, so I write here to improve english
My English teacher can't really help me
I am affraid that I am not good enough to write in Japanese
I just can only speak some short sentences like 'おげんきですか
You see, I write all in Kana because I didn't learned a lot of kanji
I hope I will learn a lot of Japanese
The research was about \"Fourier transformations and Digitral image processing
I will write about it in my next journal
It's a long-running special-effects TV series aimed at kids
They assume the identity of a grasshopper-like cyborg
仮面ライダー usually fight to protect people against monsters
But in the 仮面ライダー龍騎, the Riders fight against other Riders
They kill each other to gain special powers and claim which grant any wish. (Since I'm not too familiar with the series I'm not sure if there can be many powers or not, so I'm guessing some parts here. >.<）
One fights to revive his sister, one fights to cure his incurable disease. (If you want to make it more general, with 'some': Some fight to revive their sister(s), others fight to cure their disease
Each drives has a characteristic ability
For instance,\"Cyclone Memory\" which improves its speed, \"Metal Memory\" hardens its body ,etc
And they fight while having a good command of 2 of them
They can only insert 2 drives at once
It tickles my engineerity! (Ha, I guess I know what you mean by 'engineerity' ^_^, but maybe something more likely would be: 'engineerness'? This isn't really a word either, but I think I would use that over an 'ity' ending. For something proper, maybe 'it tickles my engineer character', 'it tickles the engineer in me' would be better- 
Do you like it?(*´∀｀) (This is proper English. In casual English, you can use what you wrote
When I was going for a moonlit stroll this night\/evening, I heard that \"bell-ringing\" crickets were singing
I recognized that the summer is finally ending and the autumn is falling\/coming\/following
I've heard that any people do not no one enjoys the songs of the crickets besides the Japaneses
So, I'm wondering what do you actually feel when you watch this video
Do you know what is a cross bike
These days cross bikes are growing in popularity amongst the Japanese
Cross bike is shaped like a breed between a road bicycle and a MTB. (MTB = mountain bike
But this cross bike is used more for travelling within towns. 
I had really wanted one for months
And finally, I got it
The shop staff told me that this was a hot-selling item this year! (... a best-seller... 
I rode back to home on it right after I purchased it from the bike shop\/store
It was a 30 minutes ride
It was great to ride on the roads
There weren't any bumps on the road y things, so I could go really fast
But I often had to stop and look back because there were so many taxis and cars parked on the streets
My bike doesn't have a stand, so I carried it all the way to the front of my apartment which is on the 3rd floor
The frame is aluminum-made, so it is as light as a feather!"
Hmm
I'm still suffered from have a headache
I'm going to absent from classes tomorrow
Good night everyone
I'm sorry that I couldn't reply to your comments and message for a few days
It was a three days and 2 nights event. [\"Three day, 2 night event.\" Just to let you know, you can also write it this way and omit the \"and\", using a comma instead. A lot of times, you can even omit the \"s
This is such a wonderful thing to do
I was struggling with errors until the (very) last train. (\"very\" is for emphasis, your sentence is perfectly fine too
When I came back\/reached home, it was already past midnight
Then I had a light supper. (we always say \"light supper\", but never \"small supper\". I wonder why
It's already half past 4 am now
This is just a the beginning. [Since you're being specific about what kind of beginning here
Even the famous general of 戦国 era, 織田信長, was there to pray for a victory before the battle of 桶狭間
Inside the shrine, there was this treasury that contained lots of treasures
And 神道 is very much related to 天皇(the Majesty the Emperor). (It's a bit odd to use \"deeply\" here
Therefore many of arts and works have been dedicated to 天皇 conventionally
Yes! The samurai swords were really cool
Me neither. ;p
But I didn't become tired at all! (It's more common to use \"grow weary
It was a really comfortable\/relaxing place. (\"Snug\" is used for other things. Like, this is a snug sweater => tight-fitting, or body-hugging
Then we went to 栄 which is downtown Nagoya and my junior joined us
There is this large Ferris wheel in the middle of downtown Nagoya
名無しさん had longed to ride one
So we rode it
Although she had longed to ride it so much, she had a fear\/phobia of heights
So she was rather quiet when we were inside the gondola the whole time
Why bears? 
I wish they felt the same as me too!"
I really regret that I couldn't write a journal entry yesterday. もっと自然な言い方は：I'm so sorry that I couldn't blog\/write an entry yesterday
When I got home, it was already past 12:00 am. (If you use 12:00, you need to put \"am\/pm\" because it can mean 1200 hours or 0000 hours. Otherwise, you can say, \"past midnight
I was writing this journal on the bed, but I fell asleep. もっと自然な言い方は：I fell asleep as I was writing this journal on my bed
The seniors sometimes link daily things to technical terms. (I know
For instance, when a guy was acting bashful\/shy\/awkward while he was talking about his girlfriend, the others hooted at him like
Then the guy retorted with
I am still self-restoreable!\" (Hahahaha
They are earnest to thier reseaches. 意訳ですが： They are very dedicated to their research (projects). 名詞なら、research　だけで良いです。
And they have lots of expert knowledge.　他の言葉は： expertise
I am so glad to to be incorporated as a member of the lab! (It's a little weird to use 'incorporated', because it sounds too formal and business-like. You can say, \"... to be part of this lab!\""
I don't understand the lyrics, so I can't translate but somehow the English sentence feels weird to me... could it be perhaps, \"Aiming at the core through a synthesizer
What I think she wants to say is, it's easy to be in the charts or follow the crowd

The Love and the Japanese language
Japanese, however, hadn't have the proper word which signifies \"love\" then because of the sensibilities and lyricism. (sensibilities and lyricism
When one of his students translated \"I love you\" into Japanese as ”私はあなたを愛しています\", he warned him against that translation
Japanese would say  \"今夜は月が綺麗ですね\"(which means \"The moon looks more beautiful tonight\") instead
I think what he meant was that \"love\" is the feeling that makes the moon looks brighter than the moon you (usually) see by yourself
Continuing from my previous journal entries
After the cake buffet, we saw off 名無しさん and  Porschla off at the bus station
Really? I didn't know! :D
So they must have had a great time there
They had a free day on Friday because their flight would depart on Saturday afternoon. (It was Saturday morning, actually
When they got down the buss, they looked really tired
I thought it was because of the long mountain route\/road
I had other choices in mind
But I decided to take\/bring them to Atsuta Shrine
So many people go there for a stroll
I turned on the TV immediately
My recent favorite soap opera starts at 13:30. (If you want to talk about a soap opera that is currently\/recently a favourite, then it's usually more natural to keep it in a separate sentence from a time reference. For example: Recently I have a new favorite soap opera. It starts at .... Or: My favourite soap opera at the moment is ..... It starts at ..... 
So I felt regret oversleeping. (Or simply: So I felt bad about oversleeping. Or: I wish I hadn't overslept
of the drama!! (You don't need to say this, since you've already explained it. 
There was a particularly memorable line. (To emphasize that it was really special
That was, \"Our happiness shouldn't be bought at the sacrifice of any of us.\" (I'm not sure what the translation is, but something that may sound more natural is: Our happiness shouldn't be attained at the cost\/sacrifice of others
What did you do with your mother
I went to the a revolving sushi bar named \"ざぶん\" with my family and mother's mom and father's mom
There were lots of \"moms
I had (so) many bottles of sake. (The 'so' is for emphasis ;p
Don't fall down! ;p
Maybe you guys don't have a culture to have a leisurely bath! (that's right... 
I need to go and buy it when I'm in Japan then! 
This sentence is grammatically correct, but a bit ambiguous as it can either mean 1) your friend is sick and hospitalized, or 2) your friend is working or for some reason, is in a hospital although s\/he is not sick
There is a park between the nearest train station and the hospital he is in
It was raining heavily, and I was listening to music on full volume
While I was walking through the park, somehow my wallet fell out of my pocket
When I realized, I broke out in a cold sweat
There were some cash cards, credit cards, my driver license, and other stuff in it
But my wallet was taken to the police station by a kind gentlemen
Somehow the police officer remembered it
I'm writing this journal entry using my iphone on the train
Today we are having a forum about the research that my lab conducting
This time it's a badminton tournament
All of the lab members including professors are gonna take part in the tournament
So this has a aspect which is entertainment for the professors!意訳ですが：So even the professors can enjoy themselves in such a sports event
I'm going to change\/transfer my train now
I will be back at Lang8 at tonight if I am not exhausted
it's not gone! I just corrected it 
Anyway, I got to keep my spirits up
What did you do for your mom
We just finished took the graduate school entrance test last week
After the test, we had an interview
During the interview, the interviewer told us if we did well or not at the test
So, what I have to do now is only doing research
By the way, I have a something to ask you
Do you believe that there is the a right thing in this world
Like the moon, things look different by from the different viewpoints you see from
We can't see the whole things at once
A Scientific speaking, we can only perceive by the reflection of lights
What I wanna say is, a right thing might be not be right thing for others
So, I bought a book called \"A Theory of Justice
I haven't read it more than 2 pages yet
I'm trying to finish this book within this month
I also started attending English conversation class
There are so many things to write about
One journal entry is not enough to finish up writing about my these days!"
名無しさん, her friends named Porschla, みよきちさん, atukiくん and his friend なつえ and me
The motivation for this trip was 名無しさん's journal entry
She wrote that she was planning to visit Takayama with her friend 
Takayama is in the northern part of Gifu prefecture and that is close to my hometown
Then me and other 2 of her Lang8 friends decided to serve as guides for them
The rendezvous was at the Golden Clock in Nagoya station at 10 a.m
This was absolutely our absolute first time to meet  each other. 
What do you mean by this
So I ordered a bowl of rice topped with fillet pork cutlet and 味噌 sauce
And it was excellent
That pork fillet was tender and went well with the sauce
And I love it! In almost all of the sentences that you wrote, you should replace \"that\" with \"it\". It's a little hard to explain why, though. In this sentence, \"And I love that\" really means \"And I love the fact that 味噌 is a special product of Aichi Prefecture.\" \"that\" really refers to an entire sentence, or an entire idea. On the other hand, \"And I love it!\" really means \"And I love 味噌\". In this case, \"it\" refers to the subject (person, place, thing) of the preceding sentence. So, if you write about the same subject in multiple sentences, you should use \"it\" instead
Tomorrow I will continue to write about this sightseeing trip
I am so glad that I could come back to here
I have been having some tough days. (More natural suggestion: I've been having a rough time lately. Or: I've had a rough few days
I couldn't stand without pain killers until a couple of days ago
I still have big holes in my mouth, but I can eat anything I want now
It's 2 a.m. here now
I went to the otolaryngology (no clue what this is but ok!) after school today
I had to wait there about 2 hours there
Then I went to the dispensary to get some medicines for on the prescription which the doctor wrote me. (I don't believe this sentence is ungrammatical but it is definitely odd sounding to me
Then I had a dinner at home and talked with my friend on the phone for an hour and half
Then, I chatted with Mimi for a hour. (or \"I then chatted
So I don't have much time to write this journal entry because I have to get ready to go school before I go to bed. (Again, not necessarily ungrammatical but this can also be read as you are planning to go to school tonight BEFORE you go to bed. Perhaps something like \"I have to get ready for school tomorrow and go to bed.\" That would clear all possible confusion
So this time, I will just introduce my favorite song
Actually, it was my first time to go around Tokyo since I was in the 3rd your year of junior high school
I stayed at my friend's house. He are will be going to university in Tokyo in 3 days' time, and we had drinks drank every night
I got home from Tokyo on Friday evening 
And I left my house and went to my other friend's house right away
Most of my old pals gathered in his house and we drank had drink all the night
I mean it\/ It's real
Actually, my friend did it. (Not me
I was just watching the whole thing while he was having a difficult time assembling it
I had pulled out my wisdom teeth yesterday!better:I had my wisdom tooth pulled out yesterday
It still hurts so bad badly
So the pain killer is necessary all day.so I need painkillers all day
I hope it will get recovered by this weekend at the latest
Right now, my face is puffed up like a balloon
I really wanna skip the classes on Monday
I still have  a slight headache and stuffy nose
And I feel dizzy (too). (it's better to add \"too\" at the end of this sentence to make it more natural, because you mentioned previously that you had a headache and a stuffy nose
I think the fever  has  already passed away
Anyway, I can't stay on the in bed anymore
I bought a couple of books about  the TOEFL
Have anyone taken  the TOEFL before
I'm thinking to of taking that test this summer
The TOEFL has a writing section
So I'm going to write journal entries along the policy that are in accordance with the requirements (?)  of  the TOEFL writing section
I have to finish some reports tonight
I couldn't bear it! 
Smoking is similar to summoning the Mephistopheles
It will give you a nominal relief
But you will have to repeat the spell every 4 hours
But I know
I live in 1000km away from the temblor's epicenter. 
Nonetheless I felt shakiness in my house. [We'd probably say it this way:] Nonetheless I felt my house shake. 
I pray for that damages won't extend any more."
I experienced so many things which were impossible in Japan
And now she is a freshman at Luther College
I hadn't ridden a bullet train in a while. (Use \"I had never\" when it was your first time ever
So I was worried that I might not see her...(I think it's more natural to use \"I was worried that ... [bad thing will happen]\". Or maybe \"I was worried about whether I could see her or not
Today was the first day of my lab's school year
This is the website of the lab. (This is the lab's website.\/Here's a link to the lab's website
The areas of research of this laboratory are Electric Power Equipment and High Electric Field phenomenon
I'm in my 4th year at Nagoya University now. (I'm a 4th year student at Nagoya University now.\/ I'm a NAgoya University senior now
I'm inexperienced and my research competence\/skill is not high enough
So I am going to knock myself out to learning as much as possible from great professors and seniors
My dream is to be a professor in the field of Electric Power Equipment and Asset management! (Both field or area are ok in this context, but region is probably best avoided
To realize my dream, I must do my best!!! (Also: I must do all that I can! I need to do my utmost!)"
I hope everyone had a great Christmas Day
The name of the band is \"celandaine
He is the lead vocalist of the band
And he also writes songs for the band
In a band competition which all teenage bands of Japan could enter, they were awarded first prize
So I am not sure if that name is proper English
Today I went to the YFU meeting for the long-term staying overseas students who are staying long-term here in Japan
They arrived here 2 months ago
And they are going back this winter
Wow... I can't. 
We talked about why they decided to come to Japan and what they liked of Japan
Most said that they really love the food of Japanese food
Fortunately, the exhibition of the Japanese art exhibition was held on the same floor of where we were having the meeting
And it was for free for all to admit. (Or, \"admittance fees were not required\"\/ \"It was free of charge
So I brought everyone into the exhibition
So if you blow at it, it will be destroyed
And he took the pictures of us for free (too
And then they treated us to matcha and cha-gashi by courtesy of them
It was a really good experience
And I really appreciate their many kindness to us!"
I get a cold
I get a cold. (are u still cold? get or it passed already --> got
So I take a day off to write a journal entry or So I'll take a day off to write a journal entry
Good night, everyone
I'm going to bed\/I'm going to sleep
I don't like  the rainy season
Many individuals believe that nuclear power plants are a considerable danger
The Chernobyl disaster left unforgettable damages due to the explosion of the plant and  the release of the radiation
Many countries, however, decided to reconsider of nuclear power plant development
So I wrote few lines along  related to the textbook
It was really hard to write an academic writing.  (It was really hard to write academically
But if I keep writing like this, I think I will get  a good score at on the TOEFL test
もちろんですよ！頑張ってください！＾＾
The weather forecast said the rain will go on for continue this week
I think it's a little bit early to set in for  the rainy season  to begin
I'm thinking of managing my daily schedules in English
I'm thinking of managing my daily schedules in English

What do you think
I bettered my own TOEIC score! (More natural may be: I beat my own TOEIC score record
The day before yesterday, the results of the 153th TOEIC test was announced on the internet
The score of the TOEIC will be converted into the score of the English section
And 905 points will be converted to 100 out of 100
What I meant is I am finally ready to concentrate upon the entrance examination for graduate school 
We held a 2 day orientation of the YFU exchange student program
I met some former friends from high school
We talked about our senses of value. (More natural: We talked about our values\/values in life
And we talked about our future careers
My grandpa finally passed away. (Even if it's expected it's probably better to avoid saying 'finally' because it gives the impression that not only were you waiting, but also hoping for it to happen. And that's not so nice. 
I am going to see the cherry blossoms with my lab members and professors!!!"
I was transferred to the 3rd year of Nagoya University from Toyota National College of Technology last year
So last year I experienced my first campus life
At the beginning of the school year, I had almost no friends at the university
But now I am aurrounded by many friends, seniors and juniors
I received so many greetings yesterday. (It's good to remember with 'i' and 'e' that: \"It's i before e, except after c.\" It's a rhyme we learned in school. 
From friends, family, friends in US, my host family and so on
Those made me realized I have been supported by so many people
And those gave me plenty of motivation! (It depends on if you're talking about the people or the congratulations you received. If people, then \"And those really gave me a push (when I needed it)!\" or if the congrats: \"And those really pepped me!\" for example
I am going to set about taking the math section of the entrance examination for graduate school tomorrow
It's been 2 months since my last journal entry
Time flies very\/really fast
I've been through so many \"exciting\" experiences these days. (\"stimulative\" is a little unnatural here
But this margin is too small to contain all my experiences
Fermat's theorem! 
I've been concentrating on my graduation research (recently), staying overnight in the lab twice a week. (adding \"recently\" makes the sentence smoother
And the pains! ;p
Going to an Amusement park with exchange students
I had to do so many tough stuffs like doing a presentation in front of all of the lab members and professors
But they never stay long enough in my brain
I feel contented myself by reading the English, but in actual fact, I learned nothing
I guess I need to put more focus on studying English
The highlight of the rides is the roller coaster called \"Steel Dragon
It was in the Guinness Book as the world's tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster
Some of the beams? were broken
I am not good at such rides machines
But one of them the exchange students who is from Michigan really likes those kind of things
So I was dragged along too
I chickened right in front of the platform once
I had been having a fear for a long time
It was way more fun funner than I thought
It's been a while since the last time I wrote in my journal
I'm sorry about I haven't been able to give you any help for a month
But I'm done with all of my exams
This means the beginning of 2 months of spring break
I'm trying to write a jounal at least once in aevery 3 days
And I'll try to give you what any help I can
By the way, I found some beautiful lines written by Miyazawa Kenji
But I don't know how to put it them into English
Flowers raining in the sky, we call them stars
Stars shining on the earth, we call them flowers
Something like this that
What the Japanese government said and what the foreign press said differed in many accounts
Maybe the Japanese government has been trying to control information to avoid a panic
but this backfired. and
many people are disoriented. or possibly \"disconcerted
The Tokyo Electric Power Company was one of the most secured reliable large companies
but that day, it fell off failed
Now, nothing is certain."
In addition to the my last journal entry, my birthday happens to coincide with the end of the cherry blossom season, so all the cherry trees are in full blossom
I went out to the park with my friends to enjoy a picnic under the cherry blossoms on my birthday
The park was congested  with many people. (It's okay to use 'congest', although I personally find it a little weird. Another word to use is \"crowded
So it was not as if I could enjoying the pretty gardens
But people were having fun with beer bottles in their hands and the foods of nearby stalls
As the time went by, people are spending lesser time to appreciate nature. 意訳ですが
But they still have hearts to love and enjoy having fun with friends! (I don't quite understand this sentence
this was not what I was going to write
So, see you then!"
【PR】My best friend's band is releasing their major debut album on 4\/21
He is one of my best friends
We went to the same school and had been in the same class for five years
I wrote a journal entry about him and his band a while ago
At that time, I asked you for some help for the name of the major debut album on his behalf
He hopes his songs will be the fire and warmth in your heart
Enjoying our lives is \"an\" important thing
But while we live in \"a\" each nations, there are responsibilities and obligations
I really \"have to\" reflect \"up\"on myself about this."
The subject was \"Is it possible that each of the people all over the world to use the same amount of energy that a Japanese uses now
At no distant future a time may come when people will use up all the oil
But if the blade is damaged by lightning and needs replacement, the wind must be slight enough to undertake the repair work safely
This means that operating a wind power generator requires constant and powerful wind but it must be stopped periodically
So I think I should go to bed a bit than earlier tonight
I will write more about the energy problem sometime soon
I have appointment with doctor tomorrow morning
So I have to finish it tonight and leave him to turn it tomorrow morning
I haven't dinner yet
Sorry that I've been unable to correct your journals these days.(´；ω；｀
So correcting your journal entries from that computer is really hard to do.(´・ω・
So I'm thinking I will bring the laptop computer which I usually use at home to the lab, and leave it there for some time
Furthermore, my graduation research could be a kind of simulation stuff,I think. (Sorry, don't know what you are trying to say
YES
But I decided to do it to save my money
But it's gonna be much more powerful than the ones made by manufacturers
I'm thinking of using some wire shelves which I've kept outside
They are covered badly with rust so bad
I have a BBQ and hiking (to do) this weekend
I guess this is gonna take a while."
I didn't have a refrigerator
and so, I used to take my meals at the school cafeteria, or just buy some convenience food
And by gigantic city, I mean (it's) Tokyo
Feng-Sui derives from China, long time ago
But has been used in Japan since medieval times for a long time
Where the queer monk, 天海, rearranged the whole city of Edo under the Feng-Shui's doctrine
To make the long story short, he changed the names of places around the castle
He also placed many temples and Japanese style gardens under the Feng-Sui style
Though many of Japanese are not aware of it
I was at the \"Tacos Party\" last night
All the participants works for YFU as a volunteers
The second picture is of the handmade tiramisu
One of them had the birthday recently had his\/her birthday
It was not only tacos party, but also her birthday party
It's been a week since the last time I wrote a jounal
Last Thursday, I was present at the party.Last Thursday, I went to a party
That party was aimed for learnig English conversation!The party was to help us practice English conversation
ThisThese kind of parties are held periodically
But this was my first time to take part in one
And I waited for them about 30 minutes underin the cold wether
We could drink as much many drinks as we wanted
I drunk littersdrank litres of Gin and Tonic
We onlyjust had English conversations
But also it was fun to talk with Japanese people who are interested in English
I forgot about that this was my firtst time and enjoyed speaking English
Those pictures were taken at there
I am the guy who is accidentally kissing with the 42 year old guy in the second picture.) 
Around 22:30, people started leaving. if not they were missing the last trains.If they didn't, they would miss the last trains
Then wemoved to the next place
We walked about 10 or 20 minutes with a straggeringly!Lol - i don't know what you're saying here! 
We talked about many funny things (mostly indecent things) at there
We stayed at there until morning
I have TOEIC test in a months
I didn't  write a journal entry last night.ｐ(≧ヘ≦。)ｑ
But the computer which was provided for me by the lab was really slow
I tried to uninstall some applications and did a virus check (too). (It will sound more natural if you add \"too\" at the back of your sentence
It took a couple of hours. (This is a set phrase, \"a couple of ...\", \"a set of...\", \"a dozen of...\" etc etc
Then the workshop started
When I got to home, it was (already) past 10 p.m. (＞、＜
I still could write a journal entry but I was too exhausted
I need to be more steady
And sleeps for only an hour
He says his bed is too comfortable so
He might sleep for more than an hour if he sleeps in the bed
I don't know if an hour is enough for me
I feel proud of Japan's culture
I also feel sad for the losses of that culture
The Golden Week starts tomorrow
There are many different theories regarding what motiveates human beings to act in the ways in the what they do
I agree with the latter position because all human societal activities are directly or indirectly involved with other people around us. これの方がいいと思うけど。
Ultimately any kind of human actions are is molded by affection to from others
And I'm in the middle of the section about \"Introduction.\" hehe!　（省略しても大丈夫だと思うよ）
Now I'm writing a paper about the currents state and futeure prospects of the energy supprly in Japan
格好いいな！＾＾難しいトピックじゃない？
The more I learn, the more obvious it is that the development of the nuclear power plant is reasonable
いえいえ、ちゃんとできました！＾＾
But, \"Haste makes wastes!\",\"Stay calm!\" and \"Be cool!\""
Most of people say Eminem is one of the coarsest rappers in the history of music because of his behavior, words and his songs which are studded with insults
He has put affronts upon affronted\/insulted many celebrities in his songs such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and even his ex-wife. \"Put affronts upon\" might not be incorrect (I didn't check) but it sounds awkward
A song which is in on his 3rd album, however, shows those of his insults might be not his real intention. I think people usually say that a song is on an album, not in it
This song which you might have not heard of is named \"Hailey's Song
Hailey\" is his daughter's name
Please turn off or put your cellphone into silent mode while watching the show music video. (I think \"show\" is for something longer --like a TV program
the \"Hailey's Song
There is a huge forest where no one can trespass on its holy ground in the middle of a capital city which is well-known worldwide
The priest is a direct descendant of the the world's oldest dynasty, and he is also the only emperor who exists in the whole world now
There are three holy durables called \"The Three Sacred Treasures
Those are owned by the emperor and have been passed from generation to generation
Each of them is being guarded closely at the ancient sanctuaries and they are regarded untouchable
The gigantic city itself has also been closely protected by layered magics by a  sublime wizard since it was established
So it is an artificial city defended by magic
It is of unprecedented scale and no other such city is longer in existence, evenin the cradle of the magic."

I feel like they are doing such things just for fun (only
The First thing that I want to emphasize is there is no difference between a whale and a cow
Biologically they are both classified as mammals
Do you think it can be used as a reason to not kill it\/them
We have the culture to appreciate (?) all lives equally
April 1st is the day which called known as April Fools' Day
But I am not going to be a fool in this journal
April is the beginning of school season
I graduated from Nagoya University and got the degree of Bachelor of Engineering last month
Now I'm going to graduate school at Nagoya University
I learned many things during last year
They were not only special knowledges.I also learned more than just academics
My aim of for this year is \"learn a lot, and play a lot\" by using efficient time management!"
Midterms are finally over with! (When you say \"I am over with midterms\", this actually means \"I am fed up with midterms!\" and \"I will never study for\/write a midterm ever again!\" What I wrote is closer to what you meant, I think
Finally, the mid-terms are done over now
But not for this year
This year, it means, finally I can finally focus on my research
How about, \"Optimization of strategic maintenance of electrical equipments\"? 
I have no idea how to solve\/go about doing this yet
I have only 5 months to finish this
So I have no time to repose! [Although, \"repose\" work--it sounds odd in everyday language. I think a better word to use would be \"rest
I haven't touched my electricalelectronic dictionary these days
This means I haven't used English these days for some time. 
Learning English is unavoidable for my future. (It's a bit awkward to use \"not avoidable\" where you can use \"unavoidable\" IMHO
I have to spend more time on learning\/my English! (This sounds more natural to me)"
It has been really cold until last week
In the middle of April, It's usually warm enough to go out with wearing only a long-sleeved shirt or sometimes a casual jacket over here
But on the day of last week, it was so cold that I needed to wear a down jacket even though it's already spring! (I think an exclamation mark is more suitable here ;p
Today, the professor of the energy transforming engineering class told us some of his doubts on global warming
He described it from the viewpoints of the number of the sunspots, the axis of the earth and the earth's yearly spins 
He said that the earth is facing a global cooling now (instead of global warming). (It will make your sentence more complete if you add the blue words behind
He said it will induce a rather cool summer all over the world
The weather forecast said tomorrow is gonna be cold
I just can't wait for the nice warm spring!"
We took part in it under the YFU, (the comma here makes the sentence easier to understand) which was the exchange organization that took care of me while I was staying in America
I have been told that we were supposed to explain the activities of the YFU to students  who were interested in studying abroad
We have held such a meeting last month
So we thought that this would proceed as easily as last month's meeting
But it wasn't\/didn't
Actually this event was like a kind of extracurricular activities to the highschool girls
There were a lot of other organizations such as the group of Japanese drum players, the welfare workers and a rival organization that is called AFS
But all of them were mostly for people who wanted to study abroad
So the contents of slide show\/presentation which we prepared were mostly about how to apply for the YFU exchange program, the history of the YFU and the structure of the organization
So it was a serious type of thing and wasn't a fun thing at all
The rival organization, AFS, on the other hand, was doing really fun stuff
We totally misunderstood the purpose of the event
We felt as if we were lying on a bed of thorns."
Last Saturday, we held a Christmas Party for the exchange students
There were nine exchage students staying in the Tokai area through YFU
YFU is the one of the world's largest exchange organizations
Three years ago, I went to America for a year as an exchange student through YFU
I really appreciate to them
So, to replay and express my feeling of gratitude, I'm working for YFU as a volunteer now
These exchange students are returning to their homelandhomeat the beginning of next month
So we wanted them to have one more another precious memory of Japan <to take home with them
That was why we held the christmas party
A previous YFU exchange student now runs a cafe in Nagoya, he let us use his hall for the party
It was a really nice place
It had a nice interior with cool drawings painted all over the walls
Maybe these are drawn by themselvesthey were originals
Over 30 people came to the Christmas party, it was lovely
The foreign exchange students brang their friends - their age ranged from my age to over 50
We provided them with many snacks ,juices and Japanese traditional food like Temaki-Sushi
We had a game called \" Russian roulette wasabi cream puff
Wasabi is Japanese horseradish
It is really pungent spicy
After game,we enjoyed chatting with each other and the hall rung with the sound of laughter
One of the exchange students had a birthday on that day
So we celebrated her 17th birthday with a very cute birthday cake
I hope we made an unforgettable memory for them
I want to thank everyone who helped make this such successful party. 
I parked on the street (around\/near from) the university
And (place) where I parked was only 2 meters away from the crossroad
I (had) to pay the penalty of it (for this)｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡
The fine of (illegal) parking (is\/was) ￥18000
That was) so expensive
But I (had) to accept (that\/it), otherwise I (would got) arrested
Oh man, If I didn't commit (it), I could buy another monitor (and\/or) a graphic board!!! ---> are u for real?! 
Oh, just in case, I will upload the picture of the area that you are not allowed to park
Be careful when you park your car on (the\/that) road!"
Last week we recieved a his health screening report, and it showed some unusual numerical values.*Note: Your sentences were fine, but I might write the two sentences this way
It showed some unusual numerical values
The doctor said he has the metastasis spread of cancer of all around his body
The doctor also said his days are numbered, 3 months at the most
I'm really proud of him. my grandpa
He has given me a lot of help in life
When I hoped to study abroad in America, he was the one who approved and paid all of the expenses
He also paid my tuition fees, and what's more he is saving to prepare for my graduation school fees
When I got back from one year of studying abroad, I visited my grandparents first
He took one look at me, and suddenly he stormed about my hair color
Can you yell at the grandson you haven't seen for a whole year
He couldn't overlook that I seemed to have changed my identity and lost my pride in being Japanese
So next day, I had my hair cut really short, and dyed it black
Then I visited them again and apologized
Because I think it is part of the Japanese identity
He brought me up
I have never faced such a situation before, that someone who is really close to me is dying
At first, I kind of lost my grasp of what I was facing
I couldn't think of what I should tell him
Strangely enough I haven't been terribly grieved this week
Because I was too busy with my university stuff and other work I'm responsible for
I really appriciate what he has given me
