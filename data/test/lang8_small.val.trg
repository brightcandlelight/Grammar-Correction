It's been getting colder lately here in Japan. (\"These days\" is a phrase I often hear Japanese and Korean native speakers use in their English, although in native English speakers would probably say \"lately\" or \"recently\". It's sort of the equivalent of 最近
I find Japan's summer weather disagreeable because of its high humidity and temperature

It is a very exciting season
But, before enjoying those kind of happy times, I have to do a kind of boring, 
I have a fiancee and she is finding a job.(if she doesn't have a job yet use \"a\" job, butif she has a job then use \"her\" job
It doesn't seem easy for women to find jobs in Japan
The first, most women have babies and they have to take maternity leave
Employers don't like it even if maternity leave is the right of employees
The second,  women workers likely to quit their job because of child care or the transfer of ther husbands
If a woman worker quits her job, employers have to find a new employee
Though there are many women workers who have excellent potential, employers often hesitate to hire them
It is the first time
When I first arrived in Brisbane, it was always sunny
I am missing the warm weather
It's too hard for me
My goal is an overall 7.0, but it may need to more than 1 year
English is the harder , the more difficult language

2 months later, I am going to back to Korea
I just learned the alphabet
It is said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japanese’s, so that the Korean who study Japanese take about 1 year to speak Japanese fluently, while the other foreigners have to take 3 or 4 years or more
I found that the Korean alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese’s
How about the way to spell
And after I entered the Japanese department, I even can’t recall any English grammar that I learned before
But it’s also said that it’s very difficult to learn both of them well
One time, I had a Japanese examination
The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before see a katakana word, we just try to think of an English word and then spell it
I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reason
Then I asked my brother for advice, he said that “I like Japanese
I was acquainted with him in a Chinese chat room when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago
He is a very special person, even though we’ve met in real life yet
He is 8 years older than me but he is just a friend
He is very humorous and handsome 
He can always make me smile even when I’m in a bad mood
But in my university, at the second year of regular training, we can choose a second qualification if we want and be able to study both well
My university has about 11 foreign language departments and some other department where they teach economics, travel business, computers, and so on… If we’re learning a foreign language, we’re advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness department so that when we graduate we will have the best job
So next year, I intend to choose the English department for the second qualification
When we’re at the third year, we have a compulsory subject
It’s different from the second qualification
Because the second qualification also has economics, travel business, computers… training and it isn’t compulsory
For example, I’m learning Japanese, I have to choose one of the 10 other foreign languages
So, if next year I choose the English department, the year after I may choose Korean for second foreign language
To learn almost fluent Japanese, we have 4 years
After that, I am not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently
It’s called “the love language”, isn’t it
Do you know our Uncle Ho was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages
I can’t do it like that but I wish I could learn at least 4: Japanese, English, Korean and French
Do I have the ability to do it
I’m very worried about it
This time  we still have to test 4 Japanese skills
I’m very nervous of speaking and listening skills
It was so bad, wasn’t it? The essay topic this time will be random
I’ll have to write anything in Japanese as the topic requests
Life is short
to try hard
We wore wedding dresses despite the absence of our bridegrooms
WishI send my best wishes for to her..  I know this might sound strainge, but this is a very common usage in English - to send someone good wishes on a birthday or other occasion
That is Those are my mother’s pictures, which were taken when she was younger.  Young is also correct, but the word younger is more polite, as it doesn't imply she is so old now
Isn't she beautiful
My computer’s CD ROM was broken so I can’t install Japanese font
I’ll try to continue this diary one near day next day
There is a big difference between the east and the west, when comes to education. I always admired how the westerners educate their posterity, their method is so gentle and kind, full of love and meaning, whereas the Asian method is rather more of violence more violent, for example the Chinese people believe that a child should be educated with rods
Countless beatings from their parent is believed to be capable of forging a successful child! That's how I was brought up at least. My parent always tell me how much they love me, although they served me with rod every time I committed a wrong doing. However, when comes to the western way of parenting, it sounds like a fairy tale to me. For example, the western parents always said this to their child if they happened to be repudiate, the parent will say this \"go to your room!\" This is something that will never happen in an Asian family
Maybe our parents would never realize the trauma they had inflicted on us!"
How successful was the League of Nations in establishing peace during the 1920s
The League of Nations was an organization formed to improve the lives and working conditions of the people around the world, to work for peace through disarmament and to uphold and enforce the Treaty of Versailles
The League was successful in establishing peace during the 1920s by discouraging aggression towards other countries through negotiation. The League also planned to provide collective security through a community of power, for example in the case of Silesia, where the League settled a dispute between Germany and Poland through a plebiscite. Another example is the Aaland Islands, where after an investigation the League managed to settle a dispute between Sweden and Finland. The League was also successful in improving living standards. For example they provided direct aid and welfare to the people in need around the world. One of their famous acts is the repatriation of 400,000 WWI prisoners, whom they employed them to kill mosquitos to prevent malaria and also to prevent leprosy. They also provided economic experts to help Austria and Hungary, as well as establishing the International Labour Organization
As Three of the most powerful nations in the world did not participate in the League of Nations: they are Germany
Russia and the United States. The two most powerful countries in the League, Britain and France, wanted to recover from their economic loss in WWI so they showed no enthusiasm to get involved. The League failed to establish disarmament, first in 1923 and then in 1931, both times because of Britain and Germany's unwillingness to cooperate. However they did arrange a conference in 1928 where the Kellog-Briand Pact, which was an act of the League's assembly outlawing war, was signed by 23 nations and supported by 65 countries and which outlawed war
However the League was unsuccessful because it largely failed to achieve most of their disarmament were not achieve
The greatest achievement of the League was its work on social issues. No organization had ever tackled these problems before; until now their campaign has been taken over by the U
N so it is a great success. However it failed to stop powerful countries starting a war, failed to establish disarmament and also failed to defend \/ uphold the Treaty of Versailles. These failures gave rise to aggression by the Axis powers."
