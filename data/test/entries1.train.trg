I talk ed about my me m or ies of sp or t s day , my dr e a m and
However , we do n ' t have to go to school unti l we find out the re s ul t s of our ex a m s ,
To day I ' ve en ro ll ed at this we b s ite .
I ' d like to be better my English but it ' s difficult for me to make sen t ence s in English because of it s co ll o c ation s .
So I ' m ha p p y if you would c or re c t my di ar y .
If you ' re try ing to le ar n J a p an e se , then I ' ll c or re c t your s .
My girl f ri en d and I are con te m p la ting mar ri age .
We p l an to re g is ter our mar ri age on A p ri l 1 st , A p ri l F o o l ' s D a y , because the day is very me m or able .
As they heart i ly con g r at ul at ed us he ar ing our new s , I was very re l i e v ed .
It ' s too co l d to day
But I do n ' t think so
If you have n ' t ever been here , please come here for the s um m er : ) ha ha
S t ar ting to day , I ' m going to write a di ar y in English .
B y writing my di ar y in English , I a im to make my English s k i ll s better and to be able to co m m un ic ate with people a b ro ad .
B y writing down the da i ly even t s , I also a im to re v i e w each day and make the next day better .
I will try to do it every night .
My first go al is to con t in u e to write my di ar y for one month .
Yes ter day I went to C a i ro to play ch es s ma t ch and I w on .
But the we a ther was very co l d and ra in y .
This after no on I finish ed the T E C - 6 at last .
I felt a b ur d en had l if ted from my should er s .
No w I can conc ent r ate my at ten tion on the f in al ex a m in ation s and es s a y s .
O f course , I ho pe I can pass it .
To m or r ow is my b ir th day . I c a n ' t wait to know what s up ri se my class m ate s might give me .
I believe that tomorrow will be an un f or g e t t able day because of my l o ve ly friend s .
I like f ly ing .
I le ar n ed how to f ly an a ir c r a f t .
This picture was take n while I was le ar n ing to f ly .
D o you like f ly ing in the s k y ?
How to f a ll as le e p quick ly
If you start to ex er c is e and re ally ti re out your body , you will be n ic e and ex ha ust ed when it is time to go to be d .
When I began run n ing , es pe c i ally long er dis t ance s ( it took me a w h i le to bu il d up to that , though ) , I would go to be d and we l c ome the sweet re le a se of sleep .
In or d er to run , I began w a k ing up e ar ly , us ing the se ti p s in the ar t ic le you read .
They work ed , and the f l i p side of the e qu ation is that I became so tired at night that after a w h i le , I just could not stay up l ate any m or e .
If you begin w a k ing up e ar ly , you might be t ir ed ( O R feel tired ) for a f e w days , and even t u ally you will be for c ed either to go to sleep e ar l i er or w a ke up la ter .
It ' s easy - - - - I ' ve done it a l ot of time s .
But if you turn those things off and go to be d , and read something in be d , you will probab ly f a ll as le e p , and you will be re ally tired if you follow ed those two ti p s I ga ve a b o ve .
E x er c is e and w a ke up e ar ly , and then go to be d and read something .
My P C was b ro k en .
I sen t it to the s er v ic e c ent er .
Yes , I am writing this di ar y with a bra n d new P C !
I made s a u ce with ho r se ma c k er el .
H or se ma c k er el is very c he a p .
It co st me only 1 0 0 yen for 1 8 ho r se ma c k er el !
It was a de l ic i ous J a p an e se dinner : )
I felt a little home s ic k for my mother ' s c ook ing ; (
R e c ent ly I always c ook for myself .
I will have dinner with my friend s from or ch est r a .
I am look ing for w ar d it , but am a little b it s c ar e of it .
He a p p ro a ch ed us at to day ' s part y .
To be able to do a present ation is an im p or t ant s k i ll , is n ' t it ?
I live in S a it a m a which is next to Tokyo .
It take s 3 0 minute s from here to Tokyo .
I re g is ter ed for this sit e to study language . My friend re c o m m en d ed
it to me because some on e can c he c k out my j o ur n al s and I can make friend s from other co un t ri es .
It would be great , if I could make many friend s and le ar n about another country ' s c ul ture .
A fter a 3 - week - stay in my re l at ive ' s home , I went to my gr and m o ther ' s home in L ish u i with my family to ce le b r ate C h in e se N e w Y e ar to g e ther .
Then I came back to J in h u a and visit other re l at ive ' s house s , and f in ally I return ed to un ive r s ity to p re p ar e for my new se m est er .
I also have six mo d ul es to le ar n in this se m est er , five of which are comp ul s or y and the re m a in ing one is op tion al .
However , I have n ' t de c id ed which op tion al mo d ul e I ' m going to take without having a b ri e f understand ing .
I at ten d ed my G er man course to day . There were just four students , T re s s , T ur k and I , at ten d ing class because X - ma s is coming .
My teacher is an am us ing guy . He asked T ur k to tea ch us T ur k ish , and asked me to tea ch them C h in e se .
B T W , they thought that C h in e se is re ally difficult because it is very different from We s ter n language s such as L at in or G er man .
A fter the class , I b ough t a bo t t le of l o c al w in e ( a kind of sp ar k ling w h ite w in e which has l ow al c o h o l ic str e ng th ) in or d er to ce le b r ate X - ma s .
: - ) This is my first time to ce le b r ate X - ma s in a for e i g n country .
I ho pe I will have a good time .
And me r ry X - ma s to every body !
I ho pe we all have a good time !
D i ar y 2 0 1 1 / 8 / 2 5
I went on a to ur of the pro g r a m m ing c amp to be in t ro d u c ed to a c qu a in t ance s .
The purpose of this c amp is to de ve l op an a p p s re la ted to S N S by two month s .
And , it was the middle present ation day to day .
H o k k a id o P o ll ock
To day , I off er ed H o k k a id o po ll ock to our C h in e se c l i ent .
The p ri ce of po ll ock is very c he a p now ,
because J a p an has a large qu ant ity of po ll ock , but the mar ke t is small .
My C h in e se c l i ent will se ll the po ll ock to the C h in e se mar ke t .
W ish he will have success !
A very interest ing thing is that most me m b er s usual ly dr ive the same bra n d of c ar ex c ept this year ,
the c ar ty pe and g en er ation are different .
The an no y ing thing is that T a i pe i always has tra f f ic con g es tion on F ri day night s .
I live in K or e a and I a m a un ive r s ity st ud ent .
I am in the b as ke t b a ll tea m in my un ive r s ity .
My tea m ' s name is M E C A
In my un ive r s ity , my te a m is very st ro ng and f a m ous .
Yes ter day , we had a to ur n a ment but un f or t un ate ly we were n ' t able to w in .
O h my go d ~ I am dis c o ur age d from there s ul t
Besides , I made many mistake s in the p la y .
As soon as I entered the p u b , I dr an k so j u ( k or e an al c o h o l ) .
My tea m me m b er s and I de c id ed that
in the next to ur n a ment we will become ch amp ion s .
I went to see T r an s f or m er s D ar k of the M o on in 3 D this morning .
I ' ve see n the re st of the T r an s f or m er s ' s s er ies and I was also look ing for w ar d to see ing it .
The mo v i e was f il m ed us ing 3 D came r as for the first time .
T h us effect s in 3 D for m at were a w es ome and very natural .
The b at t le scene s had p ow er and I was very ex cited .
I thought that the mo v i e was the most effect ive 3 D for m at mo v i e that I have see n .
I saw the c a p tion ver s ion of the mo v i e .
If I could per f e c t ly understand the English con ver s ation s in the mo v i e , I would not have read the c a p tion s .
But I need ed to read the c a p tion s ha ha .
The 3 D for m at made my eyes tired , es pe c i ally from read ing the c a p tion s .
I wish that I could have enjoy ed see ing the mo v i e without J a p an e se c a p tion s .
S ch o o l L if e in P ar is
it ' s been very good so far .
P e op le here do n ' t speak any As i an language s of course , which is good for me because I p ri m ar i ly speak English and second ar i ly F re n ch here .
I think I ' ve for g ot ten a l ot of w or d s in J a p an e se .
y e a h I ' m do ing well ha ha .
I s it part of the c ul ture or a person al pro ble m ?
But any way s , I still have a l ot of im p ro v ing to do in English .
I can de al with normal con ver s ation s but when it come s to business English , it turn s out to be very difficult which I think is the same thing in any language .
We have C h in e se character s , R o m a j i which is the same thing that English speak ing people us e , Ka ta k an a is most ly us ed to de s c ri b e for e i g n w or d s , and H ir a g an a which is a J a p an e se p h on etic language .
I want to le ar n more language s like S p an ish , P or t u gue se , e t c .
She a d d ed that the purpose of the propos ed p ri ce hi ke is to pro te c t the he al th of the s m o k er .
In c l ud ing two w ome n in their e ar ly t w ent ies .
A bout 1 0 % of the people in our office are s m o k er s .
And then the `` no - s m o k ing `` r ul e became co m m on in our f i el d .
Well , that ' s n ic e and full of s un s h in e and sweet smile s .
A ll the beautiful things de p re s s ed me .
In fact , I am c ur r ent ly study ing under the English de p ar t ment in co ll e g e , but I want to have more ch ance s to p r a c t ic e my English .
I have some pro ble m s in sp el ling the w or d s right ; I usual ly for g e t how to sp e ll them or los e some letter s while sp el ling them .
A fter gradua ting from co ll e g e , I want to go to F r ance to study for my M aster ' s de g re e .
However , I just heard that F re n ch is ex t re m ly di f f c ul t . . . . .
I ho pe I can over c ome it .
O h by the way , I also have some pro ble m s in gra m m ar about the w or d s `` ho pe `` and `` if `` .
G re en G re en / G re en C ur tain
I d ropped in at the la un d ry first , and started to walk ( around ) .
D o they re ally help us c ut our en er g y us e ?
As I w ro te in my past di ar y / ent ry , we set the ra d i o ( s ) on all day in my office , and I heard on the ra d i o that gr ow ing a gr e en c ur tain s is one of the way to con s er ve / c ut en er g y .
The follow ing was what I le ar n ed about gr e en c ur tain s on the ra d i o :
G re en c ur tain s pro te c t us from the s un light coming direct ly in our room s d ur ing day time . This will make you feel like set ting your a ir - condition ' s p re se t te m p er a ture not very l ow .
S in ce it s about business , you c a n ' t re ly on things that are ri s k y .
F ir st D i ar y
I was h ed the c l o th es and c le an ed the room all day .
I ' m glad that my salary day is in 2 days .
I ' m going to go to the U K tomorrow !
The se days I hard ly write my j o ur n al in English because I am so bu s y .
My mother and I j o in ed the ( s a f e ty and b or ing ) to ur , but on the last day we have half a day of free time .
We will leave the to ur after sight se e ing at the house of p ar l i a ment in L on d on .
She also want s to go to the `` T ow er of L on d on `` before we go to O x f or d .
We can not go there once a week or anything even though we l o ve the U K so much .
I want her to go every where she want s to as much as possible .
I will write another ent ry after I go back to J a p an : )
I c aught a f e m al e be e t le on my way home from the office de s p ite that there are not many tree s around here .
I have n ' t see n one for a long time , so I was ha p p y .
I have started to write in my di ar y .
I de c id ed to go to the be d e ar ly .
I have finish ed two ta s k s for now .
I ' m tak ing a b re a k to listen to m us ic and dr in k a c up of co f f e e .
W h i ch s ing er s do you like ?
H a w a i i has many place s to see , s w im and f o o d s to eat .
I am ex cited about going there .
What place s do you re c o m m en d ?
I went to my friend ' s house .
I got on the train from ne a b y sub way st ation to the end of the line , and walk ed to my friend ' s house .
I had n ' t an um b re ll a .
I de c id ed to run to there , but the ra in was get ting strong .
It ' s ra in y sea s on in J a p an now , but it is n ' t ra in ing the se days , so I do n ' t have to b r ing an um b re ll a .
B e c a us e I l o ve to eat J a p an e se f o o d .
I like sp ic y f o o d such as k im ch e that is K o le an f o o d .
It con tain s l ot s of re d ch il ies
It effect s for ex c it ome ta b o l ic .
O f course , I even like to eat f a st f o o d such as M c d on al d s .
The reason why is it ' s s a ve time and money !
I man age a home p age as one of my ho b b ies .
A bout 4 0 - 1 0 0 people visit my we b s ite every day .
When ever some on e c l ic k s this a d ver t is e ment ar t ic le , G o o g le give s me 2 0 - 3 0 yen .
The a d ver t is e ment s con t ent is a ut o m at ic ally re la ted to the con t ent s of my we b s ite .
A bout 5 people c l ic k the se every day .
It see m s that I can get 1 0 0 y en per day ( 3 0 0 0 / M , 36 0 0 0 / Y ) .
But , I have n ' t enjoy ed it so far .
I was ex t re m e ly bu s y this week because there were pro ble m s at my job .
It will run over one year in two week s , however a so f t w ar e pro ble m was found last week .
So I had to work , f i x ing bu g s for free even though the so f t w ar e was n ' t made by me .
This is because the people who made it qu it our comp an y last month .
And if it had o c c ur r ed 2 week s la ter I could have e ar n ed some money .
What bad ti m ing !
can any body tell me which one of the follow ing us age s is c or re c t ? ?
`` I got you to wait . `` ( c or re c t ) : D
`` I had you wait . `` ( c or re c t again )
than k s for read ing this ent ry , you all have a great day ! !
C o ul d you tell me how to us e them us ing sen t ence s .
In J a p an , a s ad incident o c u ur ed .
S h in s u ke S h im ad a , who is a very p op ul ar T V person al ity , with d re w from the world of ent er tain ment because it was found out ( dis c o ver ed ) that he had re l ation s with the J a p an e se ma f i a in the past .
I like d him because his talk s were very light and very interest ing .
H is talk at t r a c t s people ' s mind s .
I am very s ad think ing that I ' ll never again see him on T V .
This I s My F ir st English E n t ry
This is my first English di ar y / j o ur n al ent ry , and it is not well - written .
But I still want to write it , because may b e I can have a good ex pe ri ence .
This is my ho pe in my so p h o m or e year at un ive r s ity .
To day I want to con t in u e my ent ry from yesterday , by writing a little b it about the require ment that I must me e t in or d er to be a d m it ted to a un ive r s ity in D en m ar k .
So , this will be the first ma j or difficult y , because I est im ate that my English le ve l right now is around the B 2 / C 1 E ur o pe an stand ar d le ve l . With in a year , I need to re a ch the C 2 le ve l in or d er to pass the To e f l with ex ce ll ent s c or es .
I will finish high school in J un e 2 0 1 3 , but if I want to a p p ly for a D an ish un ive r s ity I need to present my a p p l ic ation by M ar ch 2 0 1 3 , so I do n ' t know if they will require the c er t if ic ation that I w o n ' t have unti l J un e .
I do n ' t want to wait an ent i re year before at ten d ing the un ive r s ity in 2 0 1 4 , so next year I ' ll try to con ta c t the un ive r s ity to get / o b tain some i nformation .
But I ' ll have to le ar n D an ish to go to the gr o ce ry st or e or place s like that , I gue s s .
I ' ll see in the future . . . .
I have 1 year still to de c id e on what to do , even though I ' m pretty sure about going to D en m ar k .
I ' ll watch a mo v i e .
I ' ll eat at a re st a ur ant in the de p ar t ment st or e .
I ' m the only one at home .
A re you interest ed in And ro id ?
And I ' m study ing hard to le ar n it .
And ro id has been talk ed about a l ot in J a p an re c ent ly .
However , almost all of the i nformation about And ro id is in English .
English is ne ce s s ar y to write a good And ro id a p p l ic ation .
This is one reason that I study English .
In this country there are a bu n ch of ra c is t s .
I understand when some people say some ra c is t commen t s to me because they and I are friend s .
However , I still like it here .
I wish I could speak f l u ent ly in English and make friend s with them as A m er ic an people do with each other .
Yes ter day and the day before yesterday I work ed at a part time job .
I c a n ' t explain the de ta il s of the work , but it was re ally effort less .
In c id ent ally , I ' m en ro ll ed in a te m p or ar y e m p l o y ment a g en c y .
The work from yesterday and the day before ( yesterday ) was for / from that a g en c y .
The hour ly w age is $ 1 0 .
L a st night after work I went out to dinner with my be st friend .
A fter eat ing , we stop p ed at a b ook st or e near the re st a ur ant .
A t the B ook st or e we ra n into my friend from high school .
He is also interest ed in study ing a b ro ad , so we talk ed ( about this to p ic ) for some time .
I have only a f e w friend s who understand my de s i re to study a b ro ad .
I have a better a p p re c i ation for my friend s now .
It open s on the first S un day every month , this is the first time I have v is is ted .
A hu g e am o un t of people and a mo un tain of good s were there .
N ic e to me e t you !
I ' m study ing English ; es pe c i ally writing and speak ing .
To day ' s p l an
I ' m going to l un ch and Ka r a o ke with my friend ,
but first , I will go to S t ar b u c k s .
I like going to a co f f e e sh op in the morning .
I read b ook s , write da i ly and study English in there .
D o you have a favor ite place ?
F or e i g n er c a n ' t understand only w or d s .
It is a place where you can see the Tokyo T ow er and is very beautiful .
I went to R op po ng i after the N e w Y e ar ' s co un t down .
H a ve you heard of C ha ro ?
The do g ' s story is b ro ad c a st by N H K ra d i o and an English course on T V .
There is a small p a th name d `` O m o id e - Y o k o ch o `` in the we s ter n side of S h in j u ku S t ation .
The p a th and b ar s have S h ow a R e t ro S ty le , it look s like it has not change d for long time from S h ow a er a .
It was my first visit from this old b ar .
We enjoy ed dr in k ing some be er and other dr in k s and eat ing y a k it or is with very reason able p ri ce .
I watch ed H a k on e E k id en , which is the most f a m ous long - dis t ance ra ce in J a p an , and was b ro ad c as ted on T V for 2 days from the 2 n d of J an u ar y .
I have been watch ing this ra ce without f a il every year since I was an e le ment ar y st ud ent .
I am at t r a c ted to this ra ce .
F ir st , this ra ce has a long history .
This ra ce has been done every year for 8 5 year s .
That is , this ra ce has been tak ing place an n u ally for 8 5 year s .
This ra ce is done by U n ive r s ity students in the Ka n t o re g ion .
F or in st ance , the students put in much effort to part ic i p ate in this ra ce .
Some run n er s give up without finish ing the ra ce d u e to ex t re m e de h y d r ation and l ow b l o o d s u g ar .
Yes , this ra ce is difficult because run n er s run almost 2 0 k m .
E s pe c i ally , this ra ce is se p ar at ed 1 0 se ction s between O te machi , Tokyo and H a k on e ( 5 se ction s for one way ) , and run n er s must run 8 5 0 me ter a b o ve sea le ve l in the 5 th se ction .
That ' s why no body know s what will happen .
And the reason why I am so at t r a c ted to this ra ce is that the run n er ' s per s ever ance en c o ur age me to per s ever e no matter what happen s .
I could receiv e a l ot of in s p ir ation / en c o ur age ment and co ur age .
It ' s been a long time since I w ro te a di ar y about my ex - girl f ri en d ' s w ed d ing .
I just came here to see what ' s new here , not to write ,
but when I read the di ar y about my ex - girl f ri en d , I de c id ed to up d ate my di ar y ,
be c u a se I f e ll in l o ve with another woman .
I me t her 5 month s a g o at work .
She was just a co - work er at first .
I started my job last year but there are l ot s of reason that I ' m think ing about this .
I in ten d ed to go to a gradua te school after gradua ting from un ive r s ity .
The comp an y that I ' m work ing for is little b it strange , for ex amp le even we have to work over time we do n ' t get pai d . . . .
there are l ot s of other ex amp le s
G ri p ing and comp la in ing does n ' t change the sit u ation and any way I need to work before going back to school to pay for t u i tion
So I thought that cha ng ing my job is one of s ever al ch o ic es .
One of my friend s has already had job in ter v i e w s and he told me what he was asked .
There was a question that made him re ally e m b ar r as s ed , which was ' ' What is your strong point ? ? ' '
I think we know what we like or what we are interest ed in , but if some on e asked me ' ' what is your strong point ? ? ' '
I ' m not sure if I could answer soon or not .
I was brought up in B us an .
I re ally l o ve le ar n ing for e i g n language s and I also l o ve tra ve ling to me e t people around the world .
J u - he e ( in ter v i e w e e ) : I ' m good at con s ul ting with un i qu e people . I ' m also good in meeting s .
A l s o , I have le ad er s h i p s k i ll s and a strong mind .
I have de ve l op ed myself through gr o up act i v it ies in our school and I do a good job on it
J u - he e ( in ter v i e w e e ) : I think a f light at ten d ant should be po s it ive , respon s i ble , and can easily a d a p t in any sit u ation because they me e t va ri ous in ter n ation al people in many different sit u ation s .
they should treat them e qu ally
A l s o they should re al i z e their a ction s quick ly and c al m ly and then , try to con t ro l the pro ble m s .
I think pass e ng er s will be re le ive d by this be ha v i or , and pro f es s ion al perform ance .
P le a se sign up here .
I will po st the paper s la ter .
I ' ll never for g e t when my da n c ing teacher asked me an im p or t ant question when I was 1 7 year s old .
I had j o in ed dance c l u b when I was a sen i or , but it was very difficult for me as a new le ar n er ; no matter the po se s or te m po s , I was such as a do r k . . .
My teacher have asked me , `` Why have you come here ? ``
I did n ' t answer him , because I knew that he just want ed to re m in d me that I should be serious about da n c ing , and not be w or ri ed about any on e else ' s opinion .
I have since been le ar n ing da n c ing for 4 year s , and ho pe ful ly one day people will as k me , `` A re you a teacher ? ``
`` , not just `` A re you a dance r ?
``
On ce , when I dance d in a night c l u b , a b a ll ro o m dance in st r u c t or asked me , `` Why do you want to le ar n da n c ing ?
D o you want to become a teacher in the future ? ``
I ' ll keep le ar n ing da n c ing for ever .
I find that it ' s e as i er to say something I feel e m b ar r as s ed about in English than in M and ar in .
The a b o ve has nothing to do with this j o ur n al ent ry I am going to write .
What I want to say is , I think I should stop hi d ing my feel ing s .
I am a b s o l ut e ly an honest woman , however , my nature is to hi d e my own feel ing s .
A l s o he is very s m ar t and good at ar ch ite c ture and history .
I re ally like to go to his class , however , I always keep s il ent because I am afraid he will c ri t ic i z e what I say .
And I am going to stay in H s in ch u , so I am afraid that I w o n ' t me e t such an ex ce ll ent teacher .
And then I told him I talk to my p ar ent s every day too , but I s el d o m tell them what I did .
3 ) I am straight , but I feel more co m f or t able talk ing to w ome n .
And I feel it ' s e as i er for me to make friend s with w ome n .
I am the kind of person who will p re ten d to be care less when I me e t the guy I like .
To day is my friend ' s b ir th day .
So I want ed to sen d an e - ma il to say H a p p y B ir th day , at ex a c t ly 1 2 : 0 0 .
But I was so tired yesterday that I could n ' t sen d it .
I was as le e p . So very sh ock ing > <
A fter school , I went to a sh op p ing c ent er to study .
I st ud i ed alone unti l 1 5 : 0 0 , then Ka t t u ch an , who is my bo y f ri en d , came . He and I st ud i ed to g e ther ti ll 2 2 : 0 0 . We talk ed a little . I was ha p p y .
But , now I ' m tired . . . > <
To sp an k or not to sp an k ?
We can speak to them and tea ch them what is wrong and what is right and in the long ter m that will be more effect ive than hi t ting them .
I to t ally agree with this .
And that ' s what a good so c i e ty is , one that can e m b r a ce a mi n or ity . ( or : mi n or it ies )
I agree with this .
T ro u ble is kind of a trademark of ch il d re n .
C h il d re n are not ch il d re n any m or e if they know how to be ha ve and never make mistake s , I think .
It ' s natural that p ar ent s face all kind s of trouble when ra is ing their ch il d re n so it ' s n ic e if p ar ent s can understand and enjoy the trouble that ch il d re n make . ( or : cause )
What D o You T h in k A bout L e ar n ing O ther L an g u age s ?
D o you think the ability to m aster other language s is re la ted to the le ar n er s ' age ?
I ' m sure that people can m aster other language s regard less of their age .
However , it take s a little b it long er for old er people to m aster other language s , comp ar ed to you ng people .
I think that the most im p or t ant thing about m aster ing other language s is to ma in tain a high le ve l of mo t i v ation .
B e c a us e we c a n ' t hand le other language s like n at ive speak er s .
However , it is very va l u able for us to take our who le live s to m aster other language s .
I re m e m b er that is how my d aught er le ar n ed J a p an e se .
When she was a b a b y , I always tri ed to speak to her with simple J a p an e se p h r as es , and she watch ed J a p an e se T V show s for kid s every day .
I also read a bu n ch of b ook s in J a p an e se to her .
That mean s she gr e w up with J a p an e se language circumstance s .
There f or e , If I could do what b a b ies do to le ar n their mother to n gue s , I would be able to m aster English .
I ' ve heard that hu man being s us e only 1 0 per c ent of their bra in s .
We do n ' t us e n in e ty per c ent of our bra in s .
I think it is re ally a was te to not to us e the who le of our bra in s .
I ' m sure that we must have ex t r a room to re m e m b er other language s
I want to believe that I can m aster English , if I do n ' t ch o se the wrong way to le ar n .
I would l o ve to ma in tain a high mo t i v ation ; I also want to put myself into circumstance s where I must us e English .
I have to go to un ive r s ity now .
G o o d b y e .
So I ' ve not been s n ow b o ar d ing yet .
I wonder if I should go s n ow b o ar d ing next week .
I s A m er ic an English pro n un c i ation different from B ri t ish English one ?
I do n ' t know whether English speak er s know there are 4 kind s of English pro n un c i ation s in to e ic t est .
C er tain ly I can b ar e ly per ce ive those di f f er ence s , as for me it ' s tri f ling .
A t the same time , I wonder how n at ive speak er s feel and think of those di f f er ence s .
Some time s I heard B ri t ish is pro ud of their O R I G I N A L E N G L I S H P R O N U N C I A T I O N , and some English claim A m er ic an English pro n un c i ation is N O T for m al .
B y the way , I have been st ud ing A m er ic an English ( I mean , I us e C N N in sp ite of B B C as le ar n ing ma ter i al s and so for th ) So I am us ed to he ar A m er ic an English .
I of ten feel that both are the same .
I found this mo v i e tra il er out in A p p le tra il er s sit e .
`` The S c i ent is t `` became interest ing to me as soon as I saw it s tra il er .
W o man : So , What do you think happen s when you di e ?
M an : That ' s just your body .
I felt a little b it co l d at first but w ar m ed up after play ing .
One of my co ll e a gue s , who is over 5 0 , is very t ough because he usual ly play s ten n is after work .
I comp le te ly los e to him in terms of s ta m in a .
I feel that it is im p or t ant to ex er c is e re g ul ar ly .
When I read your e m a il , I took my mo m out to dinner that night .
She was pretty that night .
We went to have J a p an e se b b q at C a us e way B a y .
A th ough we always ( have ) dinner with her , but it ` s the first time I have for m ally invite d her .
This was very sp e c i al for us .
Let me sha re some p h ot o s with you .
We must tea ch each other to be hu m ble .
We have to be hu m ble , even if we are told to be so , when we re c o g n i z e the fact that we have f la w s , and little p ow er .
L on g time , no see .
I ' m a st ud ent at the U n ive r s ity of R it s um e i k an in J a p an .
I ' ve st ud i ed English since j un i or high school .
The reason why I ' m le ar n ing English is to go study a b ro ad .
I ' m ma j or ing in R o b ot ic e ng in e er ing , so I want to study about ro b ot ic s and sha re with those who are study ing ro b ot ic s all over the world about my i nformation , know led g e and idea s and so on .
B e c a us e of that , I ' m try ing to in c re a se my ex pe ri ence in English as much as possible every day .
My ho b b y is watch ing a ction and s c i ence f i ction mo v ies .
My favor ite mo v i e is `` B a c k to the F u ture `` .
I also like listen ing to m us ic .
I l o ve B o A and T a y l or S w if t .
One more thing , I ' m interest ed in tra ve ll ing .
E ver y time I visit another country , I can ex pe ri ence other c ul ture s and me e t people who are different from my country .
E ver y th ing is see m s so fresh .
If you find any mistake s in my j o ur n al ,
please c or re c t me .
There was an e ar th qu a ke .
It was said that a big e ar th qu a ke will happen in the near future in Y o k o ha m a .
I went to a b as ke t b a ll get - to g e ther ,
but I was just look ing , as usual .
I want to get better A S A P .
To do so , I have to work hard er on do ing re he b .
To day , I at e some tak o - y a k i .
T a k o is o c t op us in English , tak o - y a k i is a piece of o c t op us co at ed with f l o ur and gr il led into a b a ll .
I l o ve sea f o o d , particular ly sh ri m p and o c t op us .
So , I ' d like to try to eat a va ri e ty of sea f o o d dis he s ( from ) all over the world .
My friend , M in came from T ha il and 3 year s a g o .
She and I have been friend s since this A p ri l at the c ook ing school .
Some time s she tea ch es me T ha i , but I would look at the w or d s , they all looked the same .
But I know that language has r ul es of us e .
No th ing is im po s s i ble
A present ation s ch ed ul e has been f i x ed for next week .
I will give a present ation for my new c l i ent in English .
It will be first time that I give a present ation for a `` new c l i ent `` .
I need to make care ful p re p ar ation s for the up c o m ing day .
I ' m very n er v ous , but also c ur i ous .
When I ar ri v ed in K y ot o , I saw a l ot of mo d er n bu il d ing s .
I thought `` Where are the old temple s ? ? ? ``
`` This c ity is not that different from my town . . . ``
But walk ing around the c ity , I found there were many temple s and sh ri ne s there .
I thought if I could live there , then I could take a l ot of p ic s .
To day I l o g g ed in to c he c k if I have got any me s s age s .
L at er I help ed two friend s to c or re c t their C h in e se writing .
I ho pe we all can part ic i p ate in this act i v ity and sha re ha p p i ness or so r r ow with other s .
The mo v i e was F a st & F ur i ous 4 .
In the end , this f il m did n ' t dis a p po in t me .
This morning I was s c ar ed of being called to the board for an or al t est , but no teachers did .
Yes ter day I b ough t a new ce ll p h on e .
It ' s an H T C He ro .
I think it ' s just good P R .
Why do you l o ve your i P h on e ?
This week I had such a hard time
I am look ing for w ar d to going there
I want to in t ro d u ce myself but I do n ' t know what to say .
He thought I was being mo d est .
But act u ally I was try ing to be honest .
No w I am read ing some b ook s about P s y ch o l o g y .
: p ^ ^
I ho pe that it will be s un n y ! !
F ro m H o k k a id o to O k in a w a , the we a ther is bad .
J a p an e se call it ` A k is ame Z en s en ` . . . .
I stop p ed my c ar as f a st as I could , and I was narrow ly able to a v o id run n ing him over .
He must have had something wrong with his bra in , probab ly because of his old age .
It look s like it will be n ic e we a ther to day .
To do l is t T o do l is t :
* D o ex pe ri ment ( cha ng ing the me d i um )
* C re ate do c u ment s with P ow er P o in t about di a b e te s , es pe c i ally the in s ul in effect me ch an is m
I did ' n t have time to eat , as I w o ke up l ate .
A n y way , I ' m still wonder ing when my English will get better .
We went sh op p ing .
It is very c ut e !
It is small and to get there , you have to tra ve l for 3 0 minute s by boat .
There are a l ot of be a ch es , where the people go to s w im , walk or s ur f .
There are a l ot of s ur f er s in the sea be a c us e there are good w a ve s .
It is very re la x ing and every where is very c le an .
On the co a st there are a l ot of different kind s of re st a ur ant .
You can see some f ant a st ic things on this is l and !
I went to friend ' s house by sub way .
The N e w Y or k sub way s y s te m was comp le x .
However , it was a good ex pe ri ence .
A t that time , I also took a day tri p to C an ad a .
I dr o ve about 4 0 0 0 mi le s by c ar .
I want to visit the U S again .
I p l an to dr ive to N e w Y or k from L as V e g as .
I ' m a J a p an e se guy in L on d on .
T h ough I ' ve been here six month s , I still have question s which are not quite clear to me .
I think it ' s not an ex a g g er ation to say J a p an e se s er v ic e business es have high est qu al it ies in the world .
T r a in s and bu s se s in Tokyo hard ly ever c ance l their s er v ic e on the way .
T r a in s run every 2 minute s follow ing a time t able and if train is l ate for more than 5 mi n u ite s , we can get a refund .
I have n ' t take n a show er with co l d water because show er s have n ' t b ro k en and if it ' s b ro k en a re p a ir man come s and f i x es it that day .
There are cha in re st a ur ant who se ty pe s of f o o d s are n ' t so different from those at M a c d on al d s .
We can c ance l mo b i le con t r a c t s through the in ter ne t 2 4 hour s .
We can re s er ve the day we c ance l mo b i le con t r a c t s .
T h us , all J a p an e se people have to a d a p t to in c on ve n i ence s .
P l us , L on d on ' s out d at ed s er v ic e is co m m on sub j e c t for us .
Why is L on d on in c on ve n i ent , though it is in a d v ance d country and is an e c on o m ic c a p it al of the world ?
I found an interest ing we b s ite about some co m m on writing mistake s with English gra m m ar that n at ive speak er s make f re qu ent ly .
It ' s o b v i ous that those w or d s are very close in both pro n un c i ation and mean ing to each other and this make s it hard for n at ive speak er s to tell them a p ar t when it come s to writing .
If anything , co m m on mistake s J a p an e se people would make would be with ar t ic le s , co un t able no un s , and ten se .
I receiv ed my office t est along with my co - work er s to day .
It is im p or t ant to me ; _ the t est is for my pro m o tion in the office .
The pass ing s c or e is 6 0 point s .
I ' m re ally tired d u e to the t est , _ so I ' m going to be d !
How was your day ?
F or me , not good .
It is because there are many people who speak English very well in my English a c ad e m y .
A free c l u b is free of charge class for students .
In to day ' s free c l u b , we dis c us s ed about H on d ur as ' pro ble m .
We made gr o up s of 4 guy s in each gr o up to talk about it .
But me and a girl hard ly spoke .
A fter that time , I had a di f f id ence .
It ' s as if my high con f id ence became l ow .
C an you give me consolation ?
S h i z u o k a is well - know n for / p op ul ar than k s to M o un t F u j i ( F u j is an ) and gr e en tea .
I us ed to look out at it d ur ing a b or ing class .
G re en tea is the one of the f a m ous J a p an e se dr in k s in the world , I think .
S h i z u o k a is the p re f e c ture with the high est con s um p tion of gr e en tea in J a p an .
We S h i z u o k a people / P e op le in S h i z u o k a dr in k gr e en tea every day after l un ch .
U n f or t un ate ly , S h i z u o k a is not good for sight se e ing like K y ot o or Tokyo .
However it ' s the one of the be st place s to live in J a p an .
We can get to Tokyo or N a g o y a with in an hour by express train ( S h in k an s en ) .
A l m o st every body here is kind .
I ' ve started us ing T w it ter .
I ' m not sure about how to us e it very well yet .
A l s o on T w it ter , I ' ll t w e e t only in English to im p ro ve my language s k i ll .
H as any on e re g is ter ed for it ?
I year n after them , because they have b l on d ha ir , and b l u e or b r ow n eyes , and high no se s , and they have very good style .
I think they are very n ic e .
I want to be good at speak ing English , because I want to I talk with them and become friend ly with them .
However , I can not study talk ing or he ar ing .
Where should I go to me e t with them here ?
It see m s the se past two days have been n ic e and w ar m .
This im age is , as you can see , a r ough draw ing .
I c a n ' t re m e m b er if it is the one us ed in the work .
A n im at or s draw not only people , but also s m o ke and other natural p h en ome n on .
M o st an im at or s do n ' t like draw ing natural p h en ome n on .
There is a name for a person who like s draw ing natural p h en ome n on .
They are called `` effect an im at or s `` in J a p an .
The b ri d e was so beautiful and I wish I would be like her one day .
Well , I will just ho pe .
There is a p ar k between the near est train st ation and the ho s p it al he is in .
It was ra in ing he a v i ly , and I was listen ing to m us ic on full v o l um e .
While I was walk ing through the p ar k , some h ow my wall e t f e ll out of my pocket .
When I re al i z ed , I b ro ke out in a co l d s w e at .
There were some c ash c ar d s , credit c ar d s , my dr ive r l ic en se , and other stuff in it !
But my wall e t was take n to the police st ation by a kind gentle m en !
Some h ow the police office r re m e m b er ed it .
In or d er to p r a c t ic e English , I think it would be better if I us ed both English and J a p an e se in my b l o g .
A l th ough I do not think that there are many people visit ing my b l o g .
I have sp ent all of my effort le ar n ing J a p an e se .
But , now I am the four th gra d e in co ll e g e , and I want to find some work after I gradua te .
When comp ar ing English and J a p an e se , I like J a p an e se better than English .
O k a y , I am going to listen to an English dr a m a first , start ing with `` F ri en d s `` .
But I don ` t like wait ing only .
I always try to take an a ction to str i ke it ri ch in my life .
This is my first di ar y ent ry / j o ur n al ent ry .
L a st week en d , I went to the c ity of B a th in the U K .
In ter est ing ly enough , B a th is the ro ot of the English w or d `` bath `` .
A c t u ally , there is an old hot sp r ing bath made by the an c i ent R o man s in B a th .
I want ed to go in the old bath , but it was not possible because it is to be pro te c ted as a her it age sit e .
There were also C h ri st m as mar ke t s in B a th .
C h ri st m as mar ke t s see m to be a c ul ture from the E ur o pe an con t in ent .
There were many small sh op s in an open sp a ce near a big ch ur ch .
I at e Y o s en a b e , and now I am full and sleep y .
F ir st , the change in his at t it ud es about the C on st it u tion all ow ed D o u g la s s to take part in po l it ic s .
G ar ri s on i an s took up a no n v ot ing po l ic y because they thought that the po l it ic s in the United States was already c or r up t and that part ic i p at ing in it would de g r ad e themselves .
The C on st it u tion was the b as is of po l it ic s in this country , and , there f or e , there was no way for D o u g la s s to get in v o l v ed in it as long as he de n i ed the C on st it u tion .
A l th ough the speech es and writing s that he made d ur ing the G ar ri s on i an er a impress ed a l ot of people , it did not give any p r a g m at ic p ow er to D o u g la s s to a b o l ish s la ver y .
On the other hand , in po l it ic s , once you could appeal to a number s of v o ter s , you could act u ally change the so c i e ty through e le ction s and through po l ic ies in C on g re s s .
The town is very small , but is know n for it s tra d i tion al c ity s c a pe , where I could see beautiful ant i qu e ga s l amp s stand ing along stone street s and some bu il d ing s which had been bu il t about 1 0 0 year s a g o .
What ' s more , I could feel the great nature because the town was s ur r ound ed by mo un tain s begin n ing to turn re d and y e ll ow .
There , I b ough t gr il led s qu id , some f ri ed ch ic k en and potatoes , a st ic k of b an an a with ch o c o l ate , two can d y a p p le s and a can d y gra pe , four T a i y a k is and an O k on o m i y a k i .
It was good to watch some tra d i tion al dance s , which were perform ed by students of the town school , while eat ing the se f o o d s .
I enjoy ed the f o o d , the nature and the f est i v ity of the small town very much .
Yes ter day ' s di ar y
Yes ter day , I read an ar t ic le from the comp an y ma il .
I find that it ' s easy to read the ar t ic le but I c a n ' t write one .
On some days , I do n ' t l o g in on t o L an g - 8 .
I like to read ar t ic le people have written .
I like English and I like J a p an e se
but I prefer C h in e se .
No w a days , We can ex change f i re w or k s with other it e m s at street s ta ll s .
My friend s get them and us e the f i re w or k s .
B y the way , you may already know that we have a pro ble m at F u ku s h im a in J a p an .
That pro ble m is very big and on g o ing , so there is a s el f - con t ro l at m o s p he re now .
M an y f i re w or k s f est i v al s have been c ance ll ed this year .
If gr il led ch ic k en s s m e ll good , what can I say ?
I s the ch ic k en s a v or y or f r a g r ant ?
To day , we had English class .
M is s G an ga ve us a t est on translation .
But we did bad ly .
F ir st of all , our v o c a b ul ar y is poor .
We can not us e the ex a c t w or d s ( we would like ) to express our s el ve s . ha t ' s more In addition to that , most of the gra m m ar we le ar n ed in high school has been for g ot ten .
So our English has got ten w or se .
I can only us e simple w or d s .
That ' s ter ri ble
I can write but talk ing is my ma in pro ble m . My friend s are J a p an e se . H a ve a great C h ri st m as . J a v i
To day , In the morning I went to work and then in the even ing I went dr in k ing with my friend .
It ' s been a long a w h i le since the last time I went dr in k ing , so , I got dr un k so soon .
I ' m like ly to f a ll as le e p any moment .
To m or r ow , I have to work from 1 0 to 2 3 , so I ' ll go to be d now .
It has been a long time since the last time I visit ed this we b s ite .
I ho pe that I can im p ro ve my English writing s k i ll by keep ing a j o ur n al here .
I be l on g to U n b al ance , which is one of the c l u b s in my co ll e g e .
It is a c l u b that play s many sp or t s such as v o ll e y b a ll , bad m in t on , f ut s al , b as ke t b a ll and so on .
The c l u b me e t s every F ri day .
We p ic k ed tea m s and both tea m s f ough t to w in .
My tea m end ed up los ing , but we enjoy ed the game .
Even though a l ot of people say U n b al ance is a funny name , I like this c l u b !
And this we b s ite as k s me every day whether I have a ch i e v ed my go al s or not .
I just want ed to write something .
But I think that ma in tain ing the ha b it is more im p or t ant than writing long ent ri es some time s .
( This is N O T my ex c us e for not po st ing for the past ten days or so . . . ) I thought I would write some sen t ence s like I ' ve been do ing but I not ic ed that I ' d already written enough .
O K , I will make it a r ul e to write something down every day for re al ! !
To be con t in u ed tomorrow ! !
L an g - 8 has made me a l ot of friend s
I have a l ot of friend s from L an g - 8 .
I us ed to talk to some of them on S k y pe ; I was re ally ha p y to have a re l ation s h i p with them .
A ll of my friend s are re ally n ic e and kind .
They tea ch me English when I have a question and do n ' t understand something .
They ga ve me the p ow er to study English . They would c he er me up and make me feel w ar m inside . I will now read a b ook and come b a c k to us e my comp ut er again .
The D is ad v ant age s of U s ing C ar s 1 . P le a se c or re c t . T h an k you ! !
A l th ough there are some opinion s that c ar s have many pro f it s , I think that they have had a great er ne g at ive im p a c t on va ri ous things than a be ne f ic i al im p a c t .
There are two reason s : ha r m ing the en v ir on ment and de c re as ing a ch ance of co m m un ic ation .
The first reason is the en v ir on ment being ha r m ed by ex ha ust ga se s .
The ex ha ust ga se s from c ar s affect the en v ir on ment in va ri ous ne g at ive way s .
C ar b on di o x id e ga s and N O x ga s , which is a gr o up of n it ro g en e ous o x id e , are some of the ga se s .
In addition , va ri ous living things / sp e c ies of an im al s and in se c t s are becom ing ex t in c t .
F or ex amp le , one of the sp e c ies of O g as a w ar a but ter f ly , which only live s on the O g as a w ar a is l and s in J a p an di ed out because of c l im ate change .
The second reason is a de c re a se in op p or t un it ies for co m m un ic ation .
The un e x pe c ted meeting may be an enjoy able time for you and make your tra ve ll ing more f un .
So you had better not us e c ar s , but take a train , bu s , and other kind s of public tra n s p or t for tra ve l .
M an y people enjoy us ing c ar s for sh op p ing , tra ve ll ing , of c ous e , dr i v ing .
But I think it is un p ro f it able for us to con t in u e us ing them .
It is the start of the ra in y sea s on in J a p an .
I ho pe the we a ther will get better soon .
To day I am in S a p po ro on B us i ness .
It is very co l d and it ' s s n ow ing .
The f o o d is de l ic i ous though .
A t that time , I was in ch in a for my business tri p .
The a d re n al in and the feel ing of you are in the middle of the f i el d , fight ing for your life - even in a b at t le s im ul ation - give s you a new le ve l of con f id ence and p ow er !
Yes , I know , P ant er a was a da m n good b and and if you understood this re f er ence I must tell you that you have great m us ical ta s te !
But , back to the point / to p ic , I play P a in t b a ll for p ur e pleasure .
I j o in ed a gr o up of friend s who play to g e ther on S un day s in or d er to `` k i ll `` and `` be k il led `` by pai n t b a ll sh ot by co ll e a gue s just to in c re a se their week ly p re s s ur e .
So , in the end , every body go es home , ha p p y and with a smile on their face s .
It ' s quite different from the stand ar d P a in t b a ll in most part to it s r ul es and mi l it ar y character is t ic s like ta c t ic s , str ate g ies , mission s and mo ve s .
If I would re c o m m en d a for e i g n visit or who has only one day to sp en d in my country ,
for the follow ing two reason s , I think he or she should go to A k i ha b ar a .
One is that he or she can bu y a l ot of new and un us u al e le c t r ical a p p l i ance s .
There are more than 5 0 e le c t r ical a p p l i ance sh op s which display and se ll va ri ous it e m s quick ly in A k i ha b ar a .
F or ex amp le , I went to A k i ha b ar a last S un day ( in or d er ) to bu y an e le c t ri c c or d .
A t first , I only p l an n ed to bu y that c or d
But when I looked around in a f e w sh op s , I want ed to bu y some other new and ra re it e m s such as the i P h on e 4 which went on s al e a f e w month s a g o , some re d light s that are us ed in police c ar s , and an im ation D V D s of do ll s .
As a re s ul t I b ough t everything ex c ept an e le c t ri c c or d .
The other reason is that we can see original J a p an e se sub c ul ture s like those for co m ic b ook s , an im ation s , and game s .
There are a l ot of them in A k i ha b ar a because the e le c t r ical a p p l i ance sh op s se ll them .
F or in st ance , when I went to bu y a game for the P la y S t ation , I could see some people who were we ar ing the co st um es that the game character s we ar .
They are called co s p la y er s , they we ar co st um es and go to A k i ha b ar a every week en d .
S u ch people can only be see n in A k i ha b ar a .
In conc l us ion , I would suggest that a for e i g n visit or who has only one day to sp en d in my country should go to A k i ha b ar a .
When ever I go there , I enjoy bu y ing new and un us u al pro d u c t s and watch ing the co s p la y er s .
When I ar ri v ed at home ( it was usual ly around 6 : 3 0 p .
m ) , my so n and I took a bath right away .
Then , I serve d dis he s as I had p re p ar ed them the day before .
Then , I did the re st of the / my house h o l d ch or es , took care of my so n e t c . . . . . . . . . . .
This week might be as bu s y as I was a s ing le . . . . ( a s ing le ? )
A l th ough he is well know n as a s ing er - so ng w ri ter , I l o ve the way he play s g u it ar .
The sound of his g u it ar is as natural as his voice .
I was far more impress ed with his g u it ar play rather than his s ing ing .
And I have a similar impress ion of B o b M ar le y , the most f a m ous J a m a ic an
B o th the se great s ing er - so ng w ri ter s play ed the g u it ar just like their s up re m e s ing ing .
My A m a z on K in d le has ar ri v ed .
My A m a z on K in d le ar ri v ed this morning .
I am quite dis a p po in ted .
This was my first impress ion .
I b ough t it es pe c i ally to read free e - b ook s about e - business .
It has pro ble m s with the P D F for m at .
When I con ver t a P D F f i le to A m a z on ' s for m at , it does n t ' t look good .
I b ough t a b ook called the 4 - hour week from A m a z on and I am impress ed with the sp e ed of the bu y ing pro ce s s
This is act u ally one - c l ic k bu y .
I ho pe that when I will come to know the K in d le better , I will become please d with my p ur ch a se .
I am not a b ook l o ver at all .
M a y b e I should have b ough t a t able t in s te ad of an e - b ook read er ?
I ' ll try to write a small re v i e w of the A m a z on K in d le on my b l o g .
In the re c ent days , there are many people re c or d ing v id e o s on the s n ow here .
So , this time , I made a mo v i e about w h ite scene ry .
And I up l o ad ed it in my b l o g .
I want to sen d this mo v i e to people who are read ing my b l o g .
I ' ll try to finish th e next mo v i e to night !
A new ter m began two week s a g o .
My class m ate s study very hard .
I feel so tired now .
But I will work hard er .
E ver y body , please s up p or t me !
To day , I will talk about a ho b b y of mi ne :
My ho b b y is tak ing picture s .
I ' d re ally like to get a s ing le - l en s re f le x came r a .
But I do n ' t have came r as .
So I always take picture s with my ce ll p h on e .
S ing le - l en s re f le x came r as have a l ot of great f e a ture s
and there are two reason s why I want one .
S e c on d , is that the im age qu al it ies are better than di g it al came r as p re e m in ent ly .
I want to take picture s about a c r ow b ar f i el d on a ra in y day .
I think it take s such beautiful picture s because of co l or con t r a st .
I have see n that scene once , and it was wonder ful .
I ' ll never for g e t it .
I take al ot of l and s c a pe picture s ;
Some time s f l ow er s that are b l o o m ing in my ga r d en , some time s a f al le n le a f that has f al le n on the ro ad , and some time s the s k y . And that is not it at all .
A l s o , I do not like picture s of people as much .
There are W A B I and S A B I in J a p an , and I think J a p an e se do not like l and s c a pe s with people , like me .
A c t u ally , I ' d rather see just one person in a p h ot o g r a p h than many people .
B e c a us e of need not being ne ce s s ar y to speak for c i b ly the nature is easy . ( ? )
I b ough t a ha ir p in with a f l ow er .
A n y way , tak ing picture s is so f un .
It is because things see m to be different than normal a ccord ing to pass ing the l en s .
And because it help s you dis c o ver new things .
I have a co l d
My no se w o n ' t stop run n ing .
I also have a so re th ro at so I took some me d ic in e
.
With the de ve l op ment of te ch no l o g y , the way of ga in ing i nformation is not re st ri c ted to b ook s any m or e .
V ar i ous kind s of ma s s me d i a were in v ent ed to a c ce l er ate the sp re ad of know led g e , such as te le v is ion and f il m .
No w I am going to an a ly z e the a d v ant age s and dis ad v ant age s between b ook s , te le v is ion and f il m .
B ook s were consider ed as the only way of ga in ing a c k n ow led g e in the past and only certain gr o up s of people like in t el le c t u al s and po l it ic i an s could read them .
Even now , b ook s still play a c r u c i al ro le in a c ad e m e .
for ex amp le , p rofessor s in un ive r s ity us e b ook s as the ma in teaching ma ter i al and s c i ent is t s re c or d their find ing s in paper s .
The a c c ur a c y of i nformation from b ook s is un qu es tion ed , because the p u b l ish ing of a b ook is through a serious pro ce s s .
However , read ing b ook s is a pass ive way to receiv e i nformation and there are not many people that have the p at i ence to do it .
C o m p ar ed to b ook s , te le v is ion has brought us an a d ve n ture of enjoy ment of v is ion , which open ed the do or of i nformation sp re ad ing .
A ccord ing to a s ur ve y , people in T a i w an sp en d at least 2 hour s every day watch ing te le v is ion at all age s which re ve al s that the at t r a ction of te le v is ion is ir re s is t i ble .
There is no do u b t that te le v is ion has become a part of our live s because of it s ent er tain ing effect , so that T V has become as a way to sp re ad i nformation .
N ever th e less , te le v is ion b r ing s some ne g at ive effect s like mi s le ad ing a ud i ence and ex a g g er at ing sit u ation s for pro g r a m m ing purpose s .
T a ke for ex amp le , just because a person is ment ally i ll does n ' t mean that they are v i o l ent , but ment al i ll ness is easily con ne c ted with v i o l ence in some so a p dr a m as .
F il m is similar to te le v is ion , but with more dr a m at ic e le ment s .
In my point of view , f il m t ar g e t s ent er tain ment rather than g i v ing i nformation .
T a ke the mo v i e of H a p p y F e e t for ex amp le , we all know that we are f a c ing the pro ble m of the gr e en h ous e effect , but there are not many people that take it serious ly .
A fter this mo v i e , more and more people started to show conc er n about gr e en h ous e effect .
But like T V , there is too much ex a g g er ation for it to be good me d i a .
In my opinion , I would say b ook s are the most effect ive way of co m m un ic at ing i nformation , even though b ook s are not well accept ed by every on e .
T e le v is ion and f il m are a b s o l ut e ly the most accept ed and well us ed me d i a .
In terms of a c c ur a c y , I do think b ook s are the most effect ive .
F ir st of all , the f o o d , dr in k s and to b a c c o were in a high er per c ent age than other it e m s .
I re l and and T ur ke y were near 3 0 % , On the other hand , the re st of n ation s f a il ed to re a ch 2 0 % .
S w ed en , the l ow est country , re a ch ed 5 . 4 % .
It was show n the different co un t ri es con s um er sp en d ing were quite different .
M o st of the b ook s that I want to read are in English .
So , I started English study .
I ho pe I ho pe to con t in u e this di ar y .
The f l u is going around at work .
I work at an e le ment ar y school .
My co - work er has n ' t c aught the f l u even once .
She ' s also been va c c in at ed every year .
She said that everything depend ed on how you looked at it .
To day , I had a con ver s ation in English .
But I spoke very little .
She went to H o k k a id o last week en d and then to ex p l or e nature .
If I could speak English , I would be able to co m m un ic ate better .
Some time s I feel bad about both er ing you with my l ow - le ve l English .
I think that it is good ex pe ri ence for me to talk in English .
And I enjoy ed that con ver s ation very much !
If some day I di ed . What would I re g re t ?
The first thing is : I never b ough t anything for my p ar ent s , no r than k ed them .
To day , I will me e t a co ll e g e st ud ent who is look ing for a job .
She is e age r to re se ar ch many kind s of job s .
I want to help her by speak ing about my ex pe ri ence s .
F at ty
F at ty was a very p l um p and o b e se guy when we were in sen i or high .
N ever th e less , he is very s le n d er now .
Yes ter day , I asked him if he is a v a il able this week en d to a c c o m p an y me to look for language ex change .
He said , `` S or ry , I have to j o in a comp ut er ex h i b i tion . ``
I re p l i ed to him , `` O h ~ great !
what a n ic e show , you can a b s or b new know led g e of comp ut er s . ``
He respon d ed to me , `` No , I just want to take some p h ot o s of show g ir l s . l o l > . <
If some on e da re s to de st ro y my s ch ed ul e , I s w e ar I will s l aught er him . ``
W ow ~ F at ty is so serious about it .
The first di ar y .
I am study ing English to day .
I can us e English when I go for a tri p .
To day I visit ed my friend s who are my fellow English - l o ver s to have a meeting in English .
I like J a p an e se dis he s , so I had been look ing for w ar d to visit ing it .
To my s ad ness , one of our me m b er s was a b s ent from to day ' s meeting because her so n had a f ever and she had to stay at home .
: D I thought I should have w or n a k im on o .
I very much enjoy ed not only eat ing , but also see ing the ar t is t ic dis he s serve d .
The a b o ve was made by his mother ( my w if e , of course ) . : - )
I went to my friend ' s sh op to day
I went to my friend ' s sh op to day .
I had n ' t see n them in a long time .
I enjoy ed a con ver s ation with them .
The f l o o d pro ble m in T ha il and is get ting better now in some are as , but it is still c ri t ical in a p p ro x im ate ly 2 5 province s .
The next pro ble m for the T ha i people may be a f o o d short age .
My English is very poor so I ho pe the things I write are just a story for other strange r s .
s u k i - n a sh ous e t s u k a w a H ar u k i M ur a k a m i de s u .
One last thing : If I want to as k my friend where in J a p an she us ed to live , can I say `` N i h on no do k o n i s un d e i mashi ta k a `` ? That ' s c or re c t .
I got in to u ch with my friend s in H o k k a id o .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to going back to H o k k a id o in A u g ust .
I ' m tired of eat ing everything I c ook .
C an you re c o m m en d some good re c i pe s ?
I re ally like this language and I ho pe to m aster it some day .
I think that the only way to le ar n a language for re al is by us ing it with people who speak it every day , that ' s why I ' d re ally like to have some English and A m er ic an friend s who can help me to re a ch my go al .
I ho pe to me e t new people through this wonder ful and us e ful we b s ite !
S in ce I have tra ve led in A ust r al i a , I ' m becom ing a la z y person .
I like to take picture s .
B e c a us e picture s re m in d me of my me m or ies .
So I try to take a l ot of picture s when I go to a new place .
R e c ent ly I c a n ' t take picture s .
To m or r ow I have to go some where . ^ ^
If you have not ( c he c k ed ) ( read ) my previous ent ry , I ' m not sure if you know that I ' m work ing in a n ur s ing home for people with sp e c i al need s .
A fter a d d ing some s ar c a st ic commen t s to the begin n ing of my ent ry this time , I will begin the story of the girl .
To day was the first time I me t her and the last time for her to come to the n ur s ing home .
A l th ough I c a n ' t im a g in e what I will be do ing next year , her mother said she might come ( back ) to the home next year .
I wonder ed how s ad it would be if she had been living in that time .
I los t my b al ance and f e ll back w ar d s .
I called for he l p from another s ta f f me m b er .
I did n ' t get what she was going to do to me , though I wonder ed if she want ed to get on me again , she tri ed to put her little f o ot on my t high s .
My second f ing er is still in pai n .
It ' s difficult to us e a p en and other s now .
F ro m now on I have to be more care ful on do or .
my ma ter n al gr and m o ther had an op er ation because she s u f f er ed from ga ll st on es .
my mother came back home when / while I was as le e p .
I s l ept unti l 3 : 0 0 p m because I ( had ) stay ed up all night watch ing a so c c er game .
I was glad that M an ch est er United be at To t ten ha m 3 : 0 .
it was w or th stay ing up all night ( for ) .
So I saw mo v i e at school .
It is a s us p en se mo v i e that w on an A c ad e m y A w ar d a while a g o .
I was los t in thought after watch ing it .
No w I want to read the original no ve l .
I some time s as k my on line friend s about English al th ough I know an English teacher among them is even us e less .
I always end up so l v ing my own pro ble m s or just i g n or ing them .
U n less you are well - train ed or have a t al ent of language you can not tea ch other people your first language .
It ' s not like ri ce c a ke , it ' s a b re ad made of ri ce .
I re ally like one which I can bu y in the near est b a ke ry .
I got up at 1 2 : 0 0 .
I just came from my p ar ent s ' home in F u ku s h im a p re f last night so I feel very tired .
I only had a three - day ho l i day and to day is the R es pe c t - for - the - A g ed D a y here in J a p an .
I b ough t a present for my mother and e t c at a sh op p ing c ent er near my house and at e be e f to n gue dis h .
I wonder if for e i g n people eat be e f to n gue .
I had some y o g ur t and a g ing er dr in k for b r un ch to day .
I know it ' s l ate for start ing the day but that ' s normal for me on my days off .
I am sp ent .
R e c ent ly I feel out of p ow er .
When I went down to bu y something for dinner , I still was n ' t feel ing well because of my head a ch e .
So I though what kind s of f o o d may make me better , I re c al led that b an an a can be help ful with your e m o tion , so I b ough t some dr i ed b an an a f la ke s .
Then I b ough t two piece of b re ad from a b a k er .
While I was le aving the b a k er the ho st es s said `` good by e , hand s ome .
need something to dr in k ? `` I said `` no , than k s . `` Then my head a ch e seemed to f ad e .
A fter that I b ough t some ch o c o l ate and a can of co c on ut j u ic e in a s up er m ar ke t and then went back to my room .
It ' s very in ter st ing ( interest ing ) to know ( le ar n ) s la ng ( ) which is normal ly us ed by English speak er s and I ' m very glad to me e t a new and great people from around the world .
If you ha te r and o m cha t s er v ic es , I do n ' t re c o m m en d ( re c o m m en d ) it .
It ' s kind of a p r a c t ic e ( for if I ) go over se as some day .
M a y b e my w if e is going to have a b a b y in a week .
I am going to be with her when she is in la b or , and the time of the b ir th .
I am look ing for w ar d to the day of ch il d b ir th
I had something to do at the b an k and the s up er m ar ke t .
The only thing which make s me feel any better is talk ing to my girl f ri en d for a little while before going to be d .
It was after a long , long time .
I only did we i g h t train ing , but it was too hard !

To day is a little b it c l o ud y .

O ut st and ing ! ! !
S t ud y ing language s , p re p ar ing before I go to C an ad a . . and so on
I have no idea what I ' m talk ing about .
A n y way I have to c he er up !
S e e you guy s : )
She was there on business and the e ar th qu a ke str u c k a day before her de p ar ture back to C an ad a .
A c t u ally , she would have left the day before , but because her p la ne had e ng in e trouble , she had to stay there for one more night .
L u c k i ly , she was stay ing in a mo d er n hotel with e ar th qu a ke re s is t ance , so the da m age to the bu il d ing was mi n im al and she did n ' t los e the access to the In ter ne t , through which we got to know she was o k a y .
A f e w days after she got home , she w ro te an ar t ic le about her ex pe ri ence .
He re it is :
This is my very first English di ar y . . .
This week I ' ve been re la x ing , I went to U n i . , stay ed home , or d in ar y days . . .
To m or r ow I ' m going c l u b b ing in K y ot o !

I ' m re ally ex cited and I ' m going to get read y to go to the part y soon . . .
My thought s .
So , I think the w or d is right that ' the command ment is a l amp and the teaching is a light ' < P ro ver b s 6 : 2 3 >
To day I went to a ha ir s al on to have my ha ir c ut and co l or ed .
It has been while since I entered a un ive r s ity , and I ' ve de c id ed to return my ha ir to black .
So when I look in the mi r r or ,
I feel strange . l o l
B y the way , which ha ir co l or do you prefer ?
B r ow n or black ?
D i e t
My a c qu a in t ance ga ve me a big ro ll to day .
I he s it at ed whether I should eat it or not because I ' m on a di e t I ' ve been on a di e t for three days .
Some th ing but not e m p ty in my heart
I was de p re s s ed to day .
I was in my house all day and look ing for what I could do for some on e .
D o ing that , I was at a los s c u z ( because ) I did n ' t find out what I re ally want ed to know .
I have to do a l ot of things .
E x a m s are coming up soon .
But I w an n a do what I re ally l o ve to do .
I felt l on e ly .
N ever never never give up .
U se my time e f f ic i ent ly !
B e strong !
B e am b it i ous !
T h an k you .
To day is a fine and co o l day .
F a ll is coming .
I am going to be bu s y with work .
I ' ve got a l ot of wonder ful me m or ies and spoke l ot s of English .
So my di ar y need s as much c or re c ting as possible .
Even n at ive s make mistake s , but I prefer to le ar n English near ly 9 0 % .
I ' ve got to en s ur e that I study hard .
A c t u ally , d ur ing study a b ro ad , I certain ly st ud i ed more than enough .
But I w o n ' t stop le ar n ing .
I have just re g is ter ed on L an g - 8 .
I ' m work ing at the A ir p or t , so that ' s why I have to be up so e ar ly .
I ho pe to day w o n ' t be a bu s y day ( ^ _ ^ ; )
I thought the answer was ( a ) , but the answer is ( c ) .
C an you explain to me why the answer is ( c ) ?
When we speak and write in J a p an e se , we do n ' t of ten us e the sub j e c t .
I study English now , I always us e the sub j e c t when writing .
D o es it need the sub j e c t in English ?
They dr e w a certain sha pe in black and w h ite on the b l an k me d i a .
I have never sp un one before .
I could do it , but my so n could n ' t .
I had been p re p ar ing for the ex a m for about 3 month s .
I thought the ex a m would be easy as I had been p re p ar ed for it for a long time .
I still need to wait for the ex a m re s ul t s .
I do n ' t feel like do ing anything now .
I just want to catch up on my sleep and take a re st .
And I ' ll start another es s a y on la ng - 8 .
He al th c he c k !
In J a p an , the un ive r s ity start s it ' s new se m est er in sp r ing .
A ll of them looked so ha p p y .
I think they may be ex cited by a fresh place .
A t the begin n ing of the se m est er , we c he c k for our he al th condition s .
We c he c k our he i g h t , we i g h t , eyes i g h t and b l o o d p re s s ur e .
In last year ' s he al th c he c k , my he i g h t was 1 8 2 c m .
But in to day ' s c he c k , it is 1 8 1 c m .
But the pro ble m is my we i g h t .
T h ough I we i g h ed 6 8 k g last year , to day I we i g h ed 7 2 k g .
I gue s s this ga in came from a change in my life s ty le .
I b ough t a c ar last year , so I did not walk to go to my work place .
I must do my ex er c is e for my he al th !
When I was in my te en s , J a p an e se long ed for A m er ic an life , A m er ic an f il m s and A m er ic an m us ic .
The ri ch est person in the world is not B i ll G ate s , just a M e x ic an guy .
The impress ive six th sen se te ch no l o g y was in v ent ed by an In d i an te ch no l o g is t .
We have to say ho pe for the be st and p re p ar e for the w or st !
Then you are cha ot ic ally look ing for direction .
I ' d like to los e we i g h t .
I ' d like to los e a b it of we i g h t .
I ' d like to have a small er w a is t .
B e c a us e of this , I set as id e time to ex er c is e .

And the not e b ook s ' p ri ce was $ 3 0 x 4 in to t al .
The to t al was $ 4XX .
F or t un ate ly , I have a V I P c ar d , so I enjoy ed a dis c o un t of 1 0 % .
I should have hi t the b a ll more effect ive ly . .
I have n ' t been here for a long time .
I do n ' t have time now because this year I have ex a m s . . .
And much of my time is sp ent p re p ar ing for it . . .
It see m s like just yesterday I started j un i or high school .
It ' s the last year I ' m going to sp en d as a j un i or high school st ud ent , so I want to enjoy the re st of the day ( year ? ) .
He ll o .
I ' m new to this S N S .
T h an k you for read ing this me s s age .
Yes ter day , I walk ed around my home because the we a ther was so good .
There are many ch er ry b l o s s o m tree s near my home , so I watch ed them while w al k ing s l ow ly .
, it s f l ow er s do not live very long we are able to enjoy watch ing them for a little while / short am o un t of time .
B e c a us e of this I am sorry not to watch them ti ll next sp r ing , but I also think that it is the most ? beautiful of f l ow er .
I b ro ke up with my b f last night .
he said he would f i g ur e out what we or he should do from now ( he would f i g ur e out our re l ation s h i p in the future the future for our re l ation s h i p ) and tell me the next day .
but he never called me after that .
In the morning , I am going to the ha ir s al on .
A fter l un ch , I am going to bu y a s u it for the ch or us comp e t i tion .
I feel like bu y ing a s u it is co o l .
I want to us e and ch er ish it from now on w ar d .
This is the first time I have l o g g ed into L an g - 8 .
I ho pe I can make l ot s of friend s from every country .
I us ed to le ar n English , J a p an e se , and F re n ch .
No w ( co m m a not need ed ) I ' m le ar n ing K or e an ( co m m a not need ed ) because I will tra ve l to K or e a in O c t this year .
I ho pe that I can over c ome this pro ble m before going to K or e a .
I ho pe that I can make friend with every on e .
I of ten wonder . . .
I of ten wonder what is the mean ing of life ?
I do n ' t think there ex is t s a l o g ic ally reason able answer
I took the day off to day .
No w , I ' m writing a j o ur n al after a long in ter v al .
I started study ing C h in e se because it is ne c ce s ar y for me now .
I of ten me t the for e i g n er s who do not le ar n the language even they stay the country for a long per i o d .
I can im a g in e that C h in e se character s are quite hard to understand for for e i g n er s .
F or t un ate ly it is e as i er to le ar n C h in e se character s for J a p an e se , because we us e them in our language .
We im p ro ted the C h in e se character s to our language hu n d r ed s of year s a g o , and the mean ing of most of the w or d s are still the same .
We do n ' t understand each other when we speak , but can understand when we write .
( O f c o ur se , J a p an e se do not understand all of C h in e se character s , because they us e much more character s than us . )
The pro n un c i ation is so difficult , but I would like to keep try ing !
When I mo v ed here , I knew no body . I want to make many friend s .
I ' m l on e ly .
I w ro te a letter in English for the first time in my life .
I w ro te a letter to day .
I s that right ?
P le a se explain it to me .
What about your father ?
What are your s i b ling s do ing ?
I do n ' t have any s i b ling s .
O h , I see .
C an you go to the p ar k and play , now ?
O f course .
G o o d by e , see you at the p ar k .
S e e you soon .
S t ud y ing English
I j o in ed this sit e just now !
I am so ha p p y to find such a n ic e sit e and what is more , it is F R E E !
To day , I went to a S p or t c l u b ( is it right English ? ? ) as us a u al .
I go to the c l u b every S at ur day to ex er c is e and get ri d of every day str es s .
I want to make friend s with many people through this sit e .
O H , it is l ate at night . I will go to be d to keep in sha pe .
My friend s and I are try ing to go to be d before mi d night .
G o l d en We e k is over .
But I want to los e we i g h t over the s um m er .
And to night , I read the b ook ' You should do 1 7 things in t w ent ies ' .
A fter read ing it , I thought I must study English to ful f il my dr e a m .
My dr e a m is to In t ro d u ce our c ul ture to people a b ro ad ; an im e , man g a and so on .
M a y b e it w on ' t c ome tru e unti l far in the future .
But , I de c id ed to try .
H i , every on e . How are you all ?
I just want to as k about the w or d s `` o d d ``
A c t u ally , I know they mean .
But I need more ex amp le s of how the se w or d s are us ed in or d er to understand them better .
T h an k s . ^ _ ^
To day I talk ed with a girl by cha t .
She live s in U S , and is study ing to be a n ur se .
She ha te s need le s and b l o o d ,
Then I listen ed to va ri ous things about her .
and her p ar ent s are not her re al one s .
When she was three year s old , her mother di ed .
He r father does n ' t need her now .
She was gr ow ing up with a d op ted p ar ent s .
She say s that being alone is co m f or t able . . . . .
He r character is c he er ful .
I think she will have a ha p p y life .
I do n ' t know what to say . . .
She is impress ive to me .
B e c a us e I ' m on the 7 th month of my p re g n an c y .
My body feel s he a v y , but I have to work as usual .
I have a d aught er who is 2 year s old , so I have to look after her .
I wish to take a hot sp r ing bath and then eat good f o o d f at a J a p an e se - style hotel
S ur e ly , it will make me feel re la x ed .
I ' m very bu s y the se days try ing to find a job at a ho s p it al .
I ' ve been try ing to im p ro ve myself . .
, , A c t u ally , I agree with them . . .
But I have con f id ence I can perform this job very well , if they would e m p l o y me .
F or t un ate ly , I pass ed the 1 st t est at K or e a U n ive r s ity M ed ical C ent er .
The 2 n d t est is a g ro up in ter v i e w so it ' s more im p or t ant than 1 st t est .
If I pass this last t est , I can get a job at S ever ance ho s p it al .
It has very good me d ical tea m , high te ch me d ical de v ic es , good s er v ic e and very kind people .
Even though it ' s not my first ch o ic e , I ' d take a job there .
I have been a mathematics t ut or since 2 0 0 5 .
To day , I have started to tea ch a st ud ent I t aught two year s a g o .
He r gra d es are ter ri ble so I c a n ' t sleep because I am w or ri ed about that very very much . . . .
How can I tea ch ma th to help her get better ?
She only has 9 0 days unti l the ex a m .
I w ro te not long a g o , because I got dis c o ur age d by le ar n ing English .
I ' m still at the same le ve l and I c a n ' t le ar n any more .
R e c ent ly I had de p re s s ion because I did n ' t see the mean ing of life .
play po o l
Yes ter day I went to play po o l .
It was the second time that I play ed .
The first time was in N an x un ( U R L ) .
I to t ally had no c l u e at that time and thought I would never play po o l again .
But I made a l ot of pro g re s s yesterday .
and I mi s s every on e .
so bu s y the se days , I just want to say I ' m sorry .
I s there any on e who want s to S k y pe ?
O f course I will tea ch you J a p an e se as much as I can if you want to le ar n J a p an e se .
A n y way I have had a back a ch e since I had a co l d because I had to la y on my be d all day and I had high f ever . .
No w the f ever is go ne , but back a ch e is get ting w or se so I ' m not will ing to go to school because I sit down on a ter ri ble hard cha ir for at least 9 0 minute s .
Besides almost all p rofessor s only write the same as what is in the te x t b ook s on the black b o ar d .
I want to gradua te this un ive r s ity as e ar ly as I can , and I want to ent er an other gradua te school or get a job which has an over se a ' s bra n ch .
( It ' s f in ally a ut um n here . )
M an y people s u f f er ed from he at in j ur y / str o ke in J a p an , this s um m er .
H ot s um m er was not only in J a p an , but also in E ur o pe .
I heard in new s that many Russian people dr ow n ed because they were s w im m ing in the ri ver while dr in k ing v o d k a to co o l down .
I s this g l o b al w ar m ing effect ?
My work p la ce off er ed a he al th c ar e course after five to day .
I felt that it was f un but it is a little too hard for me .
I at e C h in e se f o o d .
It ta st ed y um m y because it was free .
I was so re l i e v ed .
I for g ot to b r ing a too th b r us h .
No w , I am in the la b room .
S ch o o l s w ot , sea r ch ing for a job , and a part - time job . . .
But also there is something n ic e
A girl who m I w ro te my 1 st j o ur n al with ga ve me a call .
I have n ' t said that , because she is in a re l ation s h i p with another person .
he said `` I like you all of you `` .
So after that , I ma il ed her `` I know your kind heart and ability to cha t since re ly `` .
I am so interest ed in the W or l d C up that will be he l d in So u th A f ri c a just one year la ter .
B e c a us e I am J a p an e se , I ho pe J a p an w in s against other n ation al tea m s and go es to at least the se m i f in al s .
But when I watch ed the two qu al if y ing game s against U z b e k is t an and Q at ar , to ent er the W or l d c up , the re al ity see m s different from what I ho pe .
To o bad , J a p an would probab ly los e , and could not go to even round 1 6 .
This ch o ic e is not an e f f ic i ent way to get a go al .
J a p an e se play er s have to le ar n how to us e ch o ic es like dr i b ble , pass or sh o ot b as ed on the sit u ation .
If there were more play er s like this in J a p an , the po s s i b il ty to w in in the W or l d C up would be a little high er .
E ver y sh op was close d on C h ri st m as day .
In J a p an , this ( sit u ation ) has never happen ed .
U n like yesterday , many sh op s were having a s al e and there were so many people in the c ity .
It felt like to day is N e w Y e ar s E ve
In J a p an , there is no di f f er ence between C h ri st m as day and the 2 6 th , which is the next day .
It is because sh op s give you a large dis c o un t before C h ri st m as .
A c t u ally , some sh op s in the c ity did not give me a big dis c o un t .
That does not mean anything to me .
But they usual ly se ll them at the same p ri ce , and I am not sure that they are the re al one s .
I am very bra n d con s c i ous , es pe c i ally with J a p an e se bra n d s , so I do not usual ly bu y anything here .
D id I bu y anything then ?
( I was surprise d that almost all the water was go ne . )
I will go to O t f or d in the morning , walk to B un d e en a and then stay there over night .
This is one of my favor ite qu ot es from ' P o or da d and R i ch da d ' .
Let me in t ro d u ce myself in English .
I of ten listen to m us ic on the in ter ne t .
When I was you ng , I be l on g ed to a bra s s b and .
I ' m not particular about the name of the m us ic , I just have f un with it .
I wonder where their sen se of m us ic come s from .
They are g if ted m us ic i an s .
T e a ch ing some on e my mother language is f un .
I ' m not good at the gra m m ar of my mother language , but at least I can j ud g e whether it is natural or not .
In the spirit of a volunteer , I ' ll c or re c t wrong sen t ence s as a n at ive speak er .
I may be wrong some time s , and if that happen s , please for g ive me .
I have re al i z ed that J a p an e se is difficult through ( my ex pe ri ence of ) teaching it to no n - n at ive speak er s .
What is the right ter m when ho s p it al p at i ent is being dis c us s ed , `` p at i ent ' s condition `` or `` p at i ent ' s state `` ?
There are a l ot of different s y m p t o m s , and a gr o up of do c t or s are having a dis c us s ion . ( case con f er ence )
W h i ch of the two p h r as es a b o ve is c or re c t in this case ?
It ' s almost time for my hu s b and to come home .
There is C h in e se c a b b age , sp in a ch and J a p an e se ra d ish in the f ri d g e .
F or me at , I have be e f , ch ic k en and p or k .
What should I c ook ?
I ' m not hung ry , so I do n ' t feel like c ook ing now .
No w , my d aught er is s u c k ing on my to e !
English so ng s are f il led with very n at ive express ion s , id i o m s and some time s even st up id w or d s .
This so ng have re m a in ed in my mind since the first time I came a cross it .
E s pe c i ally , I ' m from ( living in ) K y us h u , So u th - We s ter n J a p an , which is near K or e a
So , I re c o m m en d you to le ar n some J a p an e se p h r as es .
P er s on ally , I want you to us e `` Y o k ar o u - mo n ! ! `` , which mean s `` ( what ever it is , ) it ' s good ! ! `` If you say this ma g ical w or d , people in K y us h u will be more kind as usual . )
O f course , I like E u c l id as the great ma th e m at ic i an .
T ro u ble - M a k er
I am to l er ant about my sub or d in ate ' s f a il ur es .
I am in v o l v ed in s ever al pro j e c t s - that is , I have s ever al bo s se s .
One of my bo s se s is a re al trouble make r .
E ver y pro j e c t me m b er includ ing me ha te s that my bo s s always cause s trouble .
I went to watch the mo v i e H ar ry P ot ter yesterday .
It was the last one of the H ar ry P ot ter s er ies .
I enjoy ed both the b ook s and the mo v ies in the H ar ry P ot ter s er ies .
The ma in character s gr e w up over the year s and through o ut the s er ies , the act or s and act re s se s did too .
The last mo v i e was interest ing .
But if you are going to see the mo v i e , it ' s better to have read the original work before going to the c in e m a .
If you do that , it will be much more enjoy able .
S un s h in e in my w in d ow
The s un sh in ing in my w in d ow is very w ar m and it feel s good but outside is very , very co l d and w in d y .
can you gue s s what I ' m do ing ?
How about you ?
I had to work very hard and I was bu s y every day .
enjoy it with me .
I have go ne through va ri ous things and everything was good for me and work ed out , than k s to my friend s , I ' m re ally than k ful to them who have s up p or ted me to live in A ri z on a .
C h ance s are , you can not gue s s how st up id I am .
A t least , I have had v o c a b ul ar y more or less .
However even though I spoke with A m er ic an people or In ter n ation al students , I could not clear ly f i g ur e out what they said .
at that time , I had been feel ing a hu g e sen se of c ri s is and p re s s ur e .
A co up le of days la ter , I started study ing English quite hard , every time I finish ed the class es , I went to the l i b r ar y to study ; in addition to home w or k , I st ud i ed the gra m m ar b ook s which I had brought from J a p an for a ra in y day .
A c t u ally it was a mar ve l ous ch o ic e , or they could explain some of the gra m m ar style p la in ly with J a p an e se .
what ' s more , I have tri ed to a v o id J a p an e se people in A m er ic a .
I think that usual ly J a p an e se people who are going to un ive r s ity come here and are not e age r to le ar n or study English in A ri z on a .
in addition , they always ha ng out with people from the same country ; in fact , I mean they are also J a p an e se .
To day is last day of M a y .
N e x t month is always the start of the ra in y sea s on ! ! !
I do n ' t like the ra in y sea s on . . .
because co m m ut ing by train become s very hot and make s me feel bad ! !
But this year , I have good things ! !
My be st friend will be get ting mar ri ed next month ! ! !
I ' m look ing for w ar d to my friend ' s mar ri age ! !
He is very kind teacher because he always en c o ur age s students .
I like to make an effort !
I have n ' t written a j o ur n al ent ry for a long time , but de c id ed to start again and write as many as possible this year !
However , I will try to us e English as much as possible and even im p ro ve it .
R e ad new s p a p er s
There f or e , I ' ll read new s p a p er s ( or `` a new s p a p er `` ) every day if possible .
I do n ' t sub s c ri b e to any new s p a p er in my house , so I ' m going to the l i b r ar y to read it !
G o on a tri p by myself
I ' ll tra ve l to some where in the world by myself !
I ' ll take it serious ly this year : ) As a start er , I ' m going to go bu y a loud al ar m clock to day that will de f in ite ly w a ke me up !
C er e m on y D e c is ion !
I de c id ed on a w ed d ing c ent er , this M on day .
I went to two w ed d ing c ent er s .
The first one was like a gue st house and had a good at o m o s p he re .
It is very con ve n i ent for me to work out a w ed d ing p l an here .
However , we w o n ' t be in v it ing comp an y person n el , and the w ed d ing is not too for m al , either .
I think the hotel get s ( / hold s ) a l ot mar ri age s per day .
H ence , the hotel s ta f f do n ' t ( see m to ) have the time for just a pai r .
A l th ough , I am a b it re l i e v ed .
I was so ex cited .
I can us e the commen t f un ction
that includ es an explanation of J a p an e se honor if ic w or d s .
I think that it would be very difficult for a person from another country to
understand J a p an e se honor if ic w or d s .
B e c a us e even J a p an e se people c a n ' t us e them c or re c t ly .
I want to do my be st at it ( ^ O ^ ) /
I will in t ro d u ce myself a little b it .
I ' m a mar ke ter and direct or for we b a d ver t is e ment .
My hu s b and was a s y s te m s e ng in e er , but he qu it his job last year and has been p re p ar ing to become a physical train ing in st r u c t or ( physical train er ) .
I ' m a t w in . I have a t w in s is ter .
I also have a brother who is over three year s old .
He and she ( They ) live in Tokyo .
My ho b b ies are c ook ing , read ing , fashion co or d in at ing , and ri d ing a ro ad b i ke .
To day I c ook ed S p a g he t t i B o l o g ne se for l un ch and b a k ed a sea b re a m , ta i [ ? ] with ve g e t able s for dinner .
D o you know how to us e pai d ho l i day s in J a p an ?
My hu s b and to re his A ch il le s ' ten d on on the 9 th of O c t o b er , and he has n ' t been able to work for two week s .
He asked his comp an y what do c u ment s he would need to take his sick days
H is bo s s answered , ' If you have pai d ho l i day s , you can us e those for the days you are a b s ent , so then you w o n ' t need any do c u ment s from the do c t or . ``
A l m o st all J a p an e se e m p l o y e es do n ' t us e their pai d ho l i day s . They just us e it when they are sick .
I also did that when I was work ing and did n ' t think much about it unti l I went to the U K .
I heard from them how they us e their pai d ho l i day s while I was living there .
They must us e all of their pai d ho l i day s in a year , and if they are sick , they can take a sick day .
One co ll e a gue ' s hu s b and who is an I T con s ul t ant , said to me .
I was re ally surprise d to he ar from him at that time , because I knew that he was a very bu s y man in his work .
I was very en v i ous of the people of the U K , but almost no J a p an e se people will ever know about the e m p l o y ment be ne f it s of E ur o pe an work er s .
But it is not a tru e view of our live s .
So he can us e them when he is sick or in j ur ed and c a n ' t work .
P e op le of the U K probab ly c a n ' t believe that .
I read an ar t ic le that was re ally impress ive .
I have been through a great de al of things d ur ing which he was an es s ent i al person who I could not live without .
But I ' m e m b ar r as s ed to say that T H A N K Y O U for ra is ing me unti l now .
O f course I could not say this in front of him .
If you guy s are able to understand this ar t ic le in J a p an e se , I would re c o m m en d you guy s c he c k it out .
To day I made sp a g he t t i .
When ever I make sp a g he t t i , I feel pro ud of myself .
I some time s try to make different kind of sp a g he t t i .
To day ' s sp a g he t t i was V on g o le .
I will try to make other ty pe s of sp a g he t t i next time .
This t est ' s s c or e in f l u ence s what co ll e g e you ent er , what job you get and whether or not you s u c ce ed at your care er .
A l ot of people study English a l ot to try to get a high s c or e on the t est .
I want to know the va l u e of a high s c or e in a for e i g n country .
W o ul d you give me some commen t s about it ?
Yes ter day , I me t in a sh op with my last class m ate A l ic e .
She has always been a un f ri en d ly , g l o o m y and un s c o i able girl .
She has no friend s because her class m ate s did n ' t like her and did n ' t want to co m m un ic ate with her .
Yes ter day she gr e e ted me with a smile .
I was sh ock ed when I saw this change s in A l ic e .
She le ar n ed the r ul es of co m m un ic ation and now has a new friend s .
To day is a beautiful day . I w o ke up at 9 o ` clock , and had more de l ic i ous f o o d for b re a k f a st .
In the after no on , I s ur f ed the in ter ne t .
It see m s like a ti t le of a comp o s i tion in a C h in e se p ri m ar y school : p
I happen ed to see an e p is o d e of a T V ent er tain ment pro g r a m m e last night .
To a ch i e ve this , she was de ter m in ed to s a ve l ot s of money to p re p ar e for further study on da n c ing over se as .
That was t ough for a s ing le girl in C h in a .
She had to e ar n money in the day time and re v i e w dance mo ve s at night .
That was her de f in i tion of ha p p i ness .
I would like to say that , If language is a dr u g , then I am an a d d ic t ~
It see m s that she does n ' t know how to co m m un ic ate well with people .
No w , it is 1 1 : 44 at night .
In j a p an , there are many b ri ll i ant ly l it house s around my house .
A l m o st all of those house s are us ing many L E D light s .
This is because C h ri st m as will come soon .
( I will probab ly bu y a D V D re c or d er )
The se fish are my pe t s .
My father take s care of them every day .
U n t il last s um m er we had to take care of two fish es of about five c en time ter s . ( two fish )
When we started to keep them , the s i z e of them was about one c en time ter . ( their s i z e was )
However , they became big g er by fee d ing f o o d .
A t that time , I found that fish also become s big g er like other an im al s . ( G o o d s c i ent if ic o b s er v ation )
They ra re ly do n ' t know what is their live for .
S y m p a th y is their out st and ing person al ity .
A bout a month a g o , I went to C h i b a p re f e c ture to see the Tokyo G ame S h ow with my friend s .
We went there by c ar .
The even t started at 1 0 a . m . , so we had to leave our home t ow n at 4 a . m . I ' m not good at get ting up e ar ly , but I man age d ( this time around ) . * This sound s more natural
On our way to the show , we stop p ed by all the s er v ic e are as , and at e many different kind s of l o c al f o o d s .
Then we ar ri v ed at the place where the show was being he l d a little behind s ch ed ul e .
The show was re ally c r ow d ed and ex c it ing .
We got the ch ance see to n s of new v id e o game s , and took girl y picture s in a p h ot o bo o th .
I wish I could ( still ) play v id e o game s all day ( long ) .
No w I ' m a d d ic ted to U l ful s which is one of J a p an ' s most f a m ous b and .
A l th ough they ' ve already b ro k en up , their m us ic is c he er ing people up .
They b r ing back how wonder ful
l o ve for another person is , even if I get de p re s s ed when he ar ing g l o o m y new s on T V .
He is a b s o l ut e ly the great est ar t is t in the world .
If you he ar him play a co ver of `` B r ing It H ome To M e `` , you ' ll feel the go o se bu m p s of to u ch ed .
I ' m going to watch `` The So c i al N e t w or k `` to day
To day , I ' m p l an n ing to go to a ne i g h b or ing mo v i e the at er .
L at er to night I ' ll have some be er with a friend from p re s ch o o l .
A fter ten long year s , we ' ll f in ally me e t again !
It ' s been a long time since coming back here again .
I ' ve been study ing unti l now , for about 3 month s .
It was hard , but it ' s over now .
F or t un ate ly I did well on my t est this past S at ur day .
And I pass ed the first t est for ent er ing gradua te school .
N e x t , there will be an in ter v i e w on 5 S ept e m b er .
A fter the t est , I re st ed .
But after to day , I ' ll e ar n some money , read b ook s , train and p re p ar e for my in ter v i e w .
G o o d night .
Some time s we talk ed about s c ar y st or ies .
B e c a us e long time a g o , there was no H a ll ow e en s y s te m in J a p an .
To day is a hot day , I do not want to go outside , but I do not want to have an ar g u ment with my un c le either , so I f in ally agree d to his re qu i re ment .
We saw p and a 2 at the c in e m a . I watch ed it last week . It is never a ha p p y ex pe ri ence when you watch a f il m t w ic e .
when we got back home , I read some b ook ( I read a b ook name d j a v a 2 , should I say p age s ? )
T h re e hour s left to day , I need to study something before I was te it ^ - ^
It ' s good to have friend s ( who are ) from other co un t ri es because it ' s f un to know each other .
A l th ough many J a p an e se people simpl y have limit ed English pro f ic i en c y , some high ly ed u c at ed in d i v id u al s are c a p able of read ing and writing ar t ic le s in English , but still have trouble co m m un ic at ing ver b ally .
It f r ust r ate s me to see t al ent ed people who can not express their opinion s d u e to limit ed English s k i ll s .
I want to help the se people to become better co m m un ic at or s .
I want to take part in in ten s ive and in ter a c t ive co m m un ic ation train ing class es to im p ro ve their English f l u en c y .
In my opinion , such train ing is mi s s ing in c ur r ent education in J a p an .
The T O E F L and T O E I C are co m m on ly us ed to me as ur e English pro f ic i en c y .
As a re s ul t , some comp an ies set mi n im um T O E I C s c or es for certain job ti t le s . T h us , people who have n ' t st ud i ed English for year s re st ar t English le ar n ing for a limit ed time for better position s .
E n t r ance ex a m in ation s for high school s , co ll e g es , and gradua te school s in J a p an require English regard less of the ch o s en f i el d .
The im p or t ance of English is a p p ar ent through the se fact s .
I believe this is an a d ver se as pe c t of s c or e - c ent er ed c ur ri c ul um in J a p an .
S t ud ent s le ar n v o c a b ul ar y , how to an a ly z e gra m m at ical str u c ture s , and how to tra n s l ate between English and J a p an e se . However , the ability to s y s te m at ic ally co or d in ate the se a b il it ies and co m m un ic ation s k i ll s is c ur r ent ly in s u f f ic i ent .
I believe a more b al ance d a p p ro a ch that f o c us es on ver b al co m m un ic ation would help im p ro ve English f l u en c y among J a p an e se people .
L a st night , I went to a home part y ho st ed by my ta ng o st ud ent .
There was a l ot of de l ic i ous f o o d ,
some dr in k s like ch amp a g ne , w in e and be er
& p le as ant con ver s ation & D an c ing !
We dance d S al s a & T an g o .
at first , some people would not dance .
but , at last every on e did !
It was great !
Let ' s dance any where ! !
I wish I could go some where and enjoy myself but there are n ' t any place s to do that .
So , I think I will just watch some mo v ies to k i ll time .
The S u b way
M a y b e this is a good op p or t un ity to talk about the in a p p ro p ri ate be ha v i or s I have o b s er v ed on the sub way .
H a ve you ever see n any u g ly side of pass e ng er s on the sub way ?
You know some things get on your n er ve over and over again .
there are people who talk loud ly on their ce ll p h on e on the sub way .
D o n ' t get on my n er ve s please .
There are also people who watch show s on the ce ll p h on es without us ing e ar p h on es .
This ir ri t ate s me .
G o get a mo t el room ! ! ! .
P e op le who th r ow up because they dr an k too much al c o h o l .
C ome on you guy s ! ( C ome on ! )
This is my first di ar y here ~ ~ !
W ow I had n ' t know n about this b ri ll i ant sit e .
and get a d v ic e from you ! !
I do n ' t know who bu il t this sit e but he might be a thought ful person .
and please c or re c t my English .
I have been study ing P h ot o s h op C S 3 .
I know how to us e other so f t w ar e such as the M ic ro s o f t office s er ies and so on , P h ot o s h op is re ally compli c at ed ! !
I gue s s it will be f un once I have got the ha ng of it ( ^ ^ )
There are many English t ut or i al s about P h ot o s h op on the in ter ne t , and I am at them , so I am le ar n ing English and P h ot o s h op at the same time .
I ' m ex cited now because to day is F ri day !
The long week day s are finish ed .
A G o o d week en d is wait ing for me ,
I ' m look ing for w ar d to going sh op p ing tomorrow ,
and having a n ic e dinner .
I wish every day was the week en d !
I have been watch ing the A m er ic an D r a m a `` F ri en d s `` .
but the w or d s us ed in it are too difficult for me to understand without J a p an e se sub t it le s .
J o ke s may be hard for no n - n at ive speak er s to understand some time .
But still , the English us ed in F ri en d s is e as i er than English us ed in other dr a m as .
My go al is to be able to draw man g a .
However , I can not draw per f e c t ly .
I us e this sit e to p r a c t ic e pai n ting :
B y the way , there is a man g a called B a ku man in which bo y s as p i re to become man g a ar t is t s .
I am read ing it . That is why I want ed to draw man g a .
The in c re a se con s is ted of both a natural in c re a se ( , ) and im m i g r ant s from other co un t ri es , in almost e qu al am o un t s .
No r th and We st E ur o pe comp o s ed the large st p or tion of im m i g r ant s to A ust r al i a with 34 % .
F ro m the se p i e gra p h s , im m i g r ant s mo v ing to A ust r al i a con s is ted of almost half of the new p op ul ation in 2 0 0 1 ( , ) al th ough there was no sign if ic ant gr ow th in the to t al p op ul ation .
`` im m i g r ant s from other co un t ri es `` is comp le te ly fine .
I me t my friend in on - line me s se ng er r 2 days a g o .
A l s o , I asked him about what he was do ing then .
Some days a g o ,
I was re l i e v ed that `` I got re le as ed from work ing like a machi ne ``
But now , I feel a little b it tired .
It c a n ' t be help ed .
It ' s part of hu man nature .
And , I ' m think ing and writing in English now .
I ' m fight ing my limit ed express ion .
I know that I do n ' t have any sen se of English .
In the me s s age he said that he will sen t me a second - hand D V D play er .
He sen t me a very good f r u it c a ke .
They are sh in ing or / They sh in e with a very l o ve ly i v or y co l or .
my so n ' s k is se s b r ing me ha p p i ness
I am not so bu s y to day .
I am just sit ting and work ing in the normal way and in a normal mo o d .
But , of course it depend s on the pro g r a m made by the comp an y .
F or the pro j e c t I could say that I will me e t with hard days in the next week of this month .
And I know that it will go on for a long time .
A n y way , I want to write in my di ar y for now .
So , as usual I w o ke up and k is s ed my so n on the c he e k ) ) )
I like when he w a ke s up with me in the morning ) ) .
But the di f f er ence between me and his mother ( my w if e ) is that she does not like it when he w a ke s up e ar ly ) ) ) .
B e c a us e she want s to sleep after see ing me off to work . ) ) .
When my so n w a ke s up , he does not all ow to her to sleep , because he want s to have mi l k , b re ad , tea . . . .
or other kind s of f o o d ) ) )
D ur ing this time , she los es sleep and she can not sleep even though our so n has got sleep .
There f or e , this is my favor ite ho b b y , which I usual ly do ) ) .
Then I have a show er then we have b re a k f a st to g e ther .
On the other hand it is so sign if ic ant for him to w a ke up e ar ly and to have b re a k f a st with me , because he like s to have b re a k f a st with me , as other w is e he will not be in a good mo o d to get f o o d . ) )
I could say that , when my so n k is se s me e ar ly it ( and the op po s ite ) mean s my business will go on in the normal way . . . .
I tra ve led to H a w a i i before three year s a g o .
My favor ite me n u it e m is hot c a ke s .
I think that I want to eat it some time s .
`` E g g s ' n T h ing s `` have been est a b l ish ed in J a p an since 2 0 1 0 .
I watch ed the `` K ing Ka z u `` D V D to day .
He ' s one of the most f a m ous so c c er play er s in J a p an .
He ' s 43 year s old now , but he still play s as a pro f es s ion al play er .
It ' s am a z ing , because most so c c er play er s re t i re at around 3 5 or may b e 4 0 year s of age .
In the show , he was asked `` Why do you keep play ing ? `` to which he answered `` So c c er tea ch es me everything `` .
What an interest ing b ook it is !
How beautiful those f e a ther s are !
I will be glad to help you .
H al f the year has pass ed .
I think that my English ability does not im p ro ve .
F ri en d s in A ust r al i a , the United States , and B ri tain become my s up p or t at such time s .
It look s like sp r ing we a ther .
I some time s make mistake s when I write English .
O ur teacher is very str ic t but we all l o ve him .
S t i ll ( ? ) , I was able to ent er the office .
A fter I come back to B e i j ing from L i a on ing , I got a se ri o ur s f l u , I have not st ud i ed English for about 1 3 day s , I feel n er v ous .
To m or r ow , I will re c o ver my life p a ce , and sp en d more time in study ing English .
I pro m is e to get a high s c or e in my G M A T ex a m , and to e f l ex a m .
I believe in myself ~ !
To day was nothing sp e c i al , just a normal day .
However , I did one thing I ' ve always want ed to - I f in ally sub m it ted one of my pai n ting s to the L i b er ty T im es - one of the new s p a p er s in T a i w an .
It ' s act u ally not a long time after that thing , but it ' s seemed to be a very long time for myself .
I think that I am now a ma ture , more con f id ent person . I ' ve started to sp en d more time on myself , and do not think about other people ' s things .
I do n ' t mean that I do n ' t want to care about other people ' s thought but I mean that I have le ar n ed to respect myself more and more .
As for p ar ent s , It ' s time to comp ar e with them , because they are not he al th y like before , you know what I want to say , every time when I think of them I feel very s ad , I c a n ' t change anything but comp ar e with .
A bout l o ve , R es pe c t your s el f , that ' s the most im p or t ant thing I le ar n ed , if you want to give , just do it , never expect anything back but respect your s el f , r u b her / him the right way is not the way you should do , be your s el f .
I went to the be a ch with my friend M a k i and A ly to day .
we always go ther e by c ar .
But we tri ed to go there by f o ot .
We walk ed for a long time .
While we were head ing there ,
we thought that it was a c r a z y p l an many time s l o l !
But when we f in ally ar ri v ed there , we were so ha p p y ! !
We had a great time at the be a ch .
I ' m in big trouble on L an g - 8 !
I saw new c or re ction s , commen t s and me s s age s , because they p op p ed up in the to p of the first p age on L an g - 8 before .
However , such high light are go ne !
They do n ' t show up on my p age any m or e ! !
That ' s why I did n ' t not ic e some of the c or re ction s , commen t s and me s s age s the se days .
I have to c he c k each j o ur n al to see if I have new one s .
How about you ?
I ' m very ha p p y that my first di ar y ent ry had been c or re c ted b y L an g - 8 friend s so soon .
I find most of my mistake s are about c a p it al letter s with my care less ness .
I will be more c a e ful and ho pe that more friend s will come here and help me and le ar n language s to g e ther . 3Q
To day , I d ropped by L A W S O N ( one of the f a m ous con ve n i ence st or es in J a p an ) and b ough t a ch o c o l ate c a ke .

It mean s `` I have to work as a c ash i er too . ``
There ' s no respon s i b il ity , but . . .
A h ~ the study of English is so hard . .

In t ro d u c ing my s el f .

There was a / the / this ma s s ive e ar th qu a ke in J a p an , you know .
F or t un ate ly , the da m age in my dis t ri c t is not hard hi t .
I worry about J a p an ' s e c on o m y , but I tru st to make a strong come b a c k .
I am having a B B Q with my friend ' s family to day for ce le b re ting the M o ther s day .
But one of the friend s was sick so we could n ' t do it .
We had very good time , it was very pe a ce ful l .
It ' s so good to sp en d time like this .
U n f ot un ate ly I do n ' t have the time to do it .
I was surprise d to he ar that she had to see a d ent is t more than ten time s a year
I need to see him as soon as possible
`` The person who live s in the moment is a ha p p y person .
He can conc ent r ate on every s ing le moment , without re g re t ting the past no r worry ing about the future .
To day I le ar n ed about how to be good at English on w w w . ed u f i re . co m

but I im a g in ed she talk ed about how to make another people know about my less on s .
A m I right or not ?
How do I pro no un ce it ?
I wonder ed why the more game they play ed , the better they made their own game .
There are many t est s at the end of this month .
I will have to study hard .
S up po se you saw your friend To m leave your office for home about an hour a g o , and you know that it take s him about an hour to co m m ut e .
I talk ed to one of my friend s about our future p l an s .
We p l an to go to V i e t n a m to get job s that are re la ted to the f i el d of tra d ing pro d u c t s in K or .
We have to make l ot s of friend s when we ' ve done those things because we could get more i nformation on V i e t n ame se c ul ture .
He is re ally sure that we can make the most of it .
But there is one thing we should be care ful to do and that is to take care of each other .
O f course I ' ll . . .

My will is too we a k to keep the pro m is e ( or : agreement ) .

T w o week s pass ed , and it got big g er than ever . . no n - stop .
B e c a us e cha t ting with my friend s is always p le as ant , it give s me a different pleasure .
A l s o if you cha t on line with your friend s , you can sen d them picture s , so ng s and so on , no matter how far away y o u are f ro m them .

I have been bu s y the past two week s .
It was good !
I ho pe she is ha p p y .
I go to the mar ke t every week
I take my kid s when I go to the mar ke t .
The big mar ke t ( s up er m ar ke t ) has a to y sh op ( inside ) .
My kid s do n ' t ( c a n ' t ) pass by the to y sh op .
I understand my kid s ' feel ing s .
It is not a good ex pe ri ence ( for them ) .
I have not write n a j o ur n al ent ry in a while .

I a po l o g is e that I w o n ' t be able to sen d you this translation that I pro m is ed you .
Yes ter day I c aught a co l d and I have a ter ri ble head a ch e .
I ' ll make this translation when I ' m better .
To day , I was invite d by the N e w s C ent er S ch o o l of S c i ence which is a part of the S t ud ent U n ion to give a le c ture about p h ot o g r a p h y .
I was glad to do this .
No t because I was invite d , but because this mean s I am know n as a p h ot o g r a p h er , which give s me a sen se of a c c o m p l ish ment .
It does n ' t take me that long to p re p ar e the le c ture
since this is something that I am f a m il i ar with .
However , many people do n ' t j ud g e me by my p h ot o g r a p h y s k i ll s , no r even see my p h ot o s .
To be a re al p h ot o g r a p h er I need to do p l ent y of p r a c t ic e
and de ve l op a sh ar p in s i g h t .
The G o l d en week ( It is a J a p an e se ho l i day . ) pass ed .
But we had thought it would have more nature .
The ro ad was made .
But we want ed to walk on nature ' s ro ad .
This is a very f a m a us place .
We both got an ex ce ll ent paper !
She seemed to like it .
And we were also ha p p y because we do n ' t have to take the time to ent er tain her .
It was a very ti r ing day for me to day .
As I said in my previous di ar y ent ry , I work for a fact or y .
That mean s , I we ar a work un if or m and he l m e t
P e op le as s o c i ate s u it s and ne c k t ies with business people .
I co m m ut e in c as u al we ar and change c l o th es in a l ock er room of the fact or y every day .
It ' s easy work .
I had already finish ed read ing some of her other & n b s p ; works , for ex amp le , `` C on f es s ion s of a S h op a h o l ic `` .
I read up to about 2 0 p age s to day .
If I read 2 0 p age s every & n b s p ; day , it will take 2 0 days to finish read ing it .
B e c a us e of the P ul m on ar y P a th o l o g y T r a in ing S es s ion that was being he l d there .
A To t al of 2 0 0 people part ic i p at ed in the s es s ion .
P a th o l o g is t s includ ing me were about 1 0 , R ad i o l o g is t s were also about 1 0 , and all the other s were R es p ir at or y p h y s ic i an s .
On S at ur day , the s es s ion started at 9 : 0 0 , and it finish ed 1 8 : 0 0 .
That long time s es s ion we ar i ed me , but I was st im ul at ed with the con t ent s .
On the way back I read an English gra m m ar te x t b ook on the a ir p la ne .
I ' m a st ud ent in the school of ar t s at C h ul al on g k or n U n ive r s ity .
D ur ing s um m er b re a k , most of my co ll e a gue s will tra ve l a b ro ad to take for e i g n English course s .
I ' m not ri ch enough to pay for the tri p , and I ' m not s m ar t enough to w in the s ch o l ar s h i p so that I could go a b ro ad for free .
I feel a little ch il d ish , but I think I ' m a s u f f er ing from pe er p re s s ur e .
I do n ' t know why , but my English see m s to get w or se and w or se even though I ' m ma j or ing in English .
In my litera ture class , I have to read a l ot of no ve l s and study a l ot of difficult v o c a b ul ar y such as `` de m y th o l o g i z e `` ( is there any on e who us es this w or d in re al life ?
- - ' ' ) , `` p at ri ar ch y `` , and more .
Some time s I feel like I ' m not even study ing a hu man language .
I think my English has got ten w or se because I did n ' t p r a c t ic e enough , so I started to read and write more in English .
As a re s ul t , I have become a me m b er in this sit e ho p ing to de ve l op my s k i ll s .
T h an k you in a d v ance for any c or re ction s you can find !
I ' m sleep y this morning .
I ' ll w a ke up by dr in k ing black co f f e e .
D o you dr in k co f f e e when you ' re sleep y ?
What is im p or t ant in our live s ? What do we like most of all : family , friend s , the world , our comp ut er s ? O ur world is v i o l ent and we must like something in or d er to live in it .
Some people think that their family is the most im p or t ant thing in their life , and that they help s them with different pro ble m s and always understand them .
The same sit u ation a p p l ies to friend s .
They are always read y to help you and you can always re ly on them .
There are a l ot of things that we like , but are there things which can l o ve or help you ? I do u b t it .
On ly people close to us are w or th y of our l o ve and at ten tion .
E a ch person ch o o se s im p or t ant things only for themselves : family , friend s , their comp ut er or other things .

So , I shout ed at them loud ly `` F u c k off me n , come on , here I am , come get me if you da re ! H A H A ! `` There was around 3 0 m between me and them .
come on so n of a b it ch , I am going to f u c k your you ng er s is ter , o h sorry no body want s to f u c k such an u g ly mo n ke y H A H A !
you should as k other ma le mo n ke y s . `` One of them got out of the c ar , and said something back to me , but I did n ' t mind at all .
As I told you , there was about 3 0 m between me and them , even though they had r us h ed to w ar d s me on feet , I could have easily es c a p ed .
I found some stone s on the ro ad , I p ic k ed them up and th re w them to w ar d the black c ar .
I was so ex cited , the a d re n a line r us h ing to my head .
A no ther ga ng s ter got out of the c ar , and said to me `` I am going to k i ll you ! ! `` I laugh ed at them loud ly .
That night , I could n ' t sleep at all , because I was so ex cited .
My name is To m o , the man who es c a p ed from the ga ng s ter s ( cha s ing ) l o l
I ' ve already been the B o st on about six month s .
We are students so we do n ' t have enough money to take a ( an ) a ir p la ne .
A t that time , I could n ' t sleep on the bu s even though I felt tired ness ( tired ) .
No t sleep ing on the tra n s f ( p ) or t ation is a kind of my b i z ar re ha b it .
I ho pe I am not tired and do n ' t become ( a ) very sen s it ive person so I do n ' t get my friend s an no y ( an no y ed ) .
He is like a wall ! ' S m a ll k im us an ' be l on g s to my class and ' the big g est k im us an ' be l on g s to class 1 1 ( I do n ' t know about the second ta ll est one very well ) .
To day , ( now yesterday ) I tri ed to cha t with other s for the first time .
In 8 hour s , I must go to class .
He looked like he care d about the w or d s on it .
He r f a c i al express ion is so impress ive .
To day , I le ar n ed about this we b s ite .
I do n ' t know how to write in e ng l ish .
But I de c id ed that other people also study for their s el ve s .
I commen ted on another person ' s di ar y .
So I have to write in my di ar y day by day .
It is a very big present for me
no matter how I finish this re se ar ch
now a day s I need to be mo t i v at ed to study .
This was not my first time to s k i p p ing class es .
Why do n ' t I have any mo t i v ation ? ?
However , now a day s the job hu n ting time is a p p ro a ch ing and I am think ing about that .
A l s o , tak ing a business class in U C S D make s me think about my future .
With respect to business , study ing is not enough ,
I need ex pe ri ence and f a il ur e as well .
A t the same time , I re ally like life and friend s in S an D i e g o .
S O now a day s it is so compli c at ed .
I do n ' t want to was te time , so I am think ing about that .
I want to study comp ut er and C language , and try to make i p h on e a p p l ic ation s !
I want to ex pe ri ence present ation s or public speak ing because I ha te that .
I am a J a p an e se st ud ent
I would like to im p ro ve my English and make friend s with people who like ro ad - b i k ing , sp or t s and man g a .
P le as ed to me e t you
I have made my b ook .
I have cha t ted with my friend s .
I am ha p p y to know something .
I am going to do it .
I have n ' t done it before .
What am I go n n a do ?
I c a n ' t explain .
my question is , how I can us e this express ion , `` so r t out ``
C an you explain to me ?
Then what about this w or d `` guy s `` ? how is it different from the w or d , `` guy ``
G o ing back home
To day I also had a job in ter v i e w , and I was able to talk well .
In addition , I got a l ot of us e ful i nformation from the in ter v i e w er .
My home t ow n still has he a v y s n ow .
I ho pe I can get back home s a f e ly .
I always write the d ate in the ti t le of my di ar y on this we b sit e .
P le a se , some on e tea ch me .

If it pass ed a year , it is 3 8 0 th .
W i ll it con t in u e on as `` th `` ?
And I was in the second one just when I thought that I would be le aving home with my old est d aught er for her p i an o less on .
As for the th ir d one ,
I was at the d ent is t at that time .
What if the d ent is t is work ing on my bad too th then ?
My first L an g - 8 ent ry
I ho pe many people will help me take my English one s te p further !
F in ally , as I enjoy draw ing , I ' ve at ta ch ed one of my works in co l or ed p en c il .
It was a great time for re st .
E ver y on e ! ! !
I w an n a be good at English C on ver s ation before M a y !
B e c a us e there is an English speak ing t est . . .
So could you help my English speak ing ?
I w an n a talk on S k y pe every week unti l M a y if you like ! ! ! !
There f or e they need ma s s age .
R e c ent ly I have want ed to study English .
I want to talk to people all over the world . .
P le a se tell me if I make a mistake . .
We he l d the class re un ion in an all - you - can - eat re st a ur ant where f o o d is provide d by the S u k i y a k i and hot p ot .
The wait re s se s had to be so str ic t to con t ro l the time that a person took eat ing a me al
We still kept cha t ting and laugh ing the who le time .
The sub j e c t s were va ri ous , such as about ex pe ri ence s from job s to the funny things .
It seemed that we went back in time like we were all still students in school .
We are c ur r ent ly p l an n ing to have a tri p to g e ther in A p ri l .
H o pe this tri p can be ful f il led as most of our time is o c c up i ed by the work .
My nephew is coming home .
He is so c ut e .
I am play ing a v id e o game with him .
But he might be very sleep y .
I tri ed to write something in English .
I ho pe my English get s better . .
P o or k it t ies
T w o k it ten s were b or n about 3 week s a g o .
One day , my father told me that a c at ga ve b ir th to two k it ten s .
They do not be l on g to any body , and they are also home less .
Yes ter day morning my mother told me that the mother c at felt very sorry because she had los t her b a b ies .
What ' s wrong with her b a b ies ?
She is so s ad , and we feel very sorry for her as well .
And to day I heard the l ate st new s that the two k it ten s have got ten los t ! M a y b e for ever ! + G e v al t ! D c 8 +
`` M i a ow ~ ~ ~ ~ `` . . . O h , you poor ti n y de f ence less little things ! Where are you ?
You r mother is sea r ch ing for U !
P le a se come home soon !
The l i b r ar y sen t an e m a il to in f or m me that a b ook I had re s er v ed through the l i b r ar y ' s H P was a v a il able .
I stop p ed by at the l i b r ar y to fetch it on my way home this even ing .
It was the b ook I had b or r ow ed once but f a il ed to finish read ing because the d u e d ate was up .
I want ed to read it again so I re s er v ed it two month s a g o .
A t last I got it .
However my e age r ness has f ad ed .
I like ra in y days , the ra in make s me feel co m f or t able in my heart .
The ra in in M a y , like a far a way friend , b r ing s me a l o ve ly g if t .
But on ra in y days , I of ten think of many things and people in the past . It always make s me feel l on e ly and s ad .
F a m il i ar m us ic or a s ad mo v i e will w a ke up my me m or ies , by g on es of ten make me c ry , with the ra in outside .
I of ten tell myself : Let by g on es be by g on es .
To day is a g if t to me , I should t re as ur e the ha p p i ness by my side now .
I got a present from my p ar ent s .
There were many things in the bo x ; f r u it like a me l on and sweet s , ch o c o l ate s ,
the ve st and ha t made by my mother .
I felt ha p p y .
D a m n , I almost for g ot to write in my di ar y .
U m m , I almost for g ot what happen d to day . > < I was very bu s y and tired .
This morning I went to G u an g z h o u to visit my m um .
B y the way , I tri ed to p h on e of some friend s to tell them I am back .
But da m n , they are not in town . > <
She got the A c ad e m y A w ar d through this ro le .
The mo v i e was very interest ing and it was for ma ture people because it con tain ed some scene s which are not good for ch il d re n .
I have a limit ed v o c a b ul ar y
I find it cha ll e ng ing to read English te x t s .
F or what reason ?
To day I just watch ed the l ate st e p is o d e of ' G o s s i p G ir l . ' What please s me is that I think the story is going back to normal . I mean , the last co up le of e p is o d es have been kind of ri d ic ul ous .
E ver y time I watch the s er ies I always feel un b el i e v able .
F or ex amp le , every one on this show is out l and ish ly ri ch and le ad such l u x ur i ous live s that I c a n ' t im a g in e .
And in fact , I would never have the live s like their s .
However , I heard a sen t ence that impress ed me d ur ing the last e p is o d e .
N ate , one of the character s in ' G o s s i p girl , ' said , `` G r ow ing up , I never knew what I was suppose d to be . . . ``
H is w or d s to u ch ed me .
I always try to find my way in the future or expect myself to do something , but in the end it see m s that I find nothing . G O O D !
M a y b e not think ing too much is the be st way to have good days .
I just at e and then came to c he c k la ng - 8 .
On new year I am going to U th a it an i C ity , which is my home t ow n .
However I would rather ce la b ate new year in B an g k o k .
This mo ive is re ally f a m ous in T ha i .
The man who run n ing on the e le p h ant is re ally good at ( k ic k ? ) bo x ing and did not us e a st un t man . . .
He is a re ally good a ction star . . . . . ^ ^
T h an k you for coming to my sp a ce .
T w ent y two year old in no c ent guy .
I am study ing for T O E F L to im p ro ve my English , so I am glad if you c or re c t my r and o m writing !
To m or r ow and the day after tomorrow are ho l i day s .
I am very ha p p y .
H i .
My name is No b u h i ro .
I want to speak English , so I ' m study ing English .
But , I have n ' t us ed English for about 1 0 year s . . .
one day , I was talk ing on the p h on e with my friend .
some on e with you know ?
also I did n ' t play any m us ic or T V .
he said `` A re there ch il d re n ?
but of course no body was there .
I said `` is n ' t it from your side ?
but he also said `` No no from your side .
It ' s loud er !
also he said `` get ting loud er still , and some is c ry ing ! ``
I was very surprise d and tri ed to call him many time s .
but I could not re a ch him at the day .
The next day , I went to his house .
he looked very tired but he told me what happen ed the night before .
but s ud d en ly , he heard the voice s close to his e ar .
at the same time , the L i g h t in his room went out .
and his room re s on at ed with the loud laugh ter of ch il d re n .
at next moment , he had f a in ted .
L e ar n ing English is not that easy
I first f e ll in l o ve in le ar n ing English when my first over se as tri p to E ng l and 1 5 year s a g o .
( Even now it is still s u c k but a b it better I think )
In E ng l and , I visit ed many place s such as L on d on B ri d g e , M ad a m T us s a ud s , and many many more
This week , I saw `` W at er `` made by a C an ad i an and In d i an s ta f f .
It is about the live s of w id ow s in In d i a , who are dis c ri m in at ed because of the H in d i b i ble .
The set ting take s place in an or p h an age for w id ow s in In d i a in the 1 94 0 ' s ( probab ly ; G and h i is on the mo v i e ) .
In my view , it is so s ad , but I c a n ' t say it is e v il ' c a us e it is a c ul t ur al and re l i g i ous fact .
I have respect for any re l i g ion as an at he is t .
I ho pe the dis c ri m in ation is begin n ing to f ad e away though .
F ir st of all , many you ng people like to tra ve l to other co un t ri es when they finish their st ud ies from high school to le ar n about a new c ul ture .
F or ex amp le when you tra ve l to E g y p t you will le ar n ar a b ic c ul ture and you will know what they are do ing in their free time .
A l s o you will le ar n some p op ul ar ar a b ic w or d s , and you will know what kind of f o o d they eat .
When you come back to your country may b e you should work for a f e w year s to p re p ar e for study ing at un ive r s ity .
In my opinion , tra ve l or work for a year will give the students a l ot of ex pe ri ence s that will make them success ful in the future .
It ra in ed he a v i ly to day for the who le day .
F or t un ate ly , it was not po ur ing
out there when I went to school .
, however , to day was different from the other days .
p rofessor s from our s is ter un ive r s ity , so it was re ally bu s y unti l my
The bad new s is we that will hold another big con f er ence which could be just
and she get s n er v ous easily , even when there is nothing to
I always think that she is a p s y ch o , ha ha ha .
A fter writing here , I s ud d en ly not ic ed that the ti t le has nothing much to do
To day , I went to p la st ic s ur g er y c ent er and ha ir s al on .
The s al on was very beautiful but it is more ex p en s ive than that in T s u ku b a C ity and
I want to change the sh op some where else next time .
A fter going to the s al on , I went to the p la st ic s ur g er y c ent er .
The do c t or said that I have mi l d de g re e of her n i a on the ne c k .
I have to go to the ho s p it al t w ic e a week .
A fter dinner , I play ed t able ten n is with K u g a .
I want to study e ng l ish from now on ! !
I H a ve B e en R e c ent ly P re p ar ing for T O E I C and O P I c
D o you know about T O E I C and O P I c ?
The se are English pro f ic i en c y t est s .
T O E I C require s listen ing and read ing s k i ll s , and the other de m and s or al pro f ic i en c y .
In K or e a , if you want to get a job at one of the be st comp an ies , then you would need to get a high s c or e on the t est s .
G ive n that I have become a sen i or in un ive r s ity , I have to im p ro ve my s c or e .
M a y b e I could in c re a se my T O E I C s c or e re l at ive ly easily un like the O P I c .
S pe a k ing in English is very hard to for me .
How could I im p ro ve the f re qu en c y of my speech in English ?
That ' s it , I ' m half a c ent ur y old !
I ce le b r at ed ( my b ir th day ) with my family .
5 0 year s between me m or ies and the future !
This week , we ' ll return to light er me al s .
No w , J a p an e se w is ter i a is in a full b l o o m at a near b y p ar k .
The f l ow er s m e ll s sweet around here .
I l o ve the co l or of the j a p an e se w is ter i a .
It is from light p ur p le gradua l ly to de e p p ur p le .
M a y b e we were being p ul led to w ar d each other . : D
It ' s just a simple question .
The it e m which is us ed for er as ing p en c il writing is called ' er as er ' in A m er ic a , and ' r u b b er ' in E ng l and , right ?
Then how do you say the one which us es for er a se cha l k ?
I think ' er as er ' is O K , but ' r u b b er ' sound s we ir d , because it ' s not made of r u b b er ?
To day , I work ed hard and got very ex ha ust ed .
So I left to go to the g y m to work out !
There was a so c c er ma t ch between J a p an and So u th K or e a yesterday .
I did not expect such a bad re s ul t from our J a p an e se re p re s ent at ive s either .
E ver y night , as soon as I go to be d , he come s and p re s se s his no se against my face .
This mean s `` Let me get under your co m f or ter `` .
So I p u ll up my co m f or ter , and he s l i p s into a sp a ce under my ar m .
He ne at ly hu n ch es ( c ur l s ) himself and put his ch in on t o my ar m , and then , s i g h s with sat is f a ction .
This sound f i le was made by me and my A m er ic an friend who is le ar n ing J a p an e se .
I me t her at another co m m un ity ( not L an g - 8 ) .
We , for the first time , act u ally talk ed to each other .
Yes ter day my friend from school told me about her s um m er l o ver ( he he ) .
He is p rofessor of It al i an in the U S A and he said he ' s so a d d ic ted to Russian litera ture ( . .
and may b e to Russian girl s ? . . ) , es pe c i ally D o st o e v s k y .
`` The who le world l o ve s him ! `` I said and indeed it is tru e .
You know who was b or n on the same d ate , do n ' t you ?
But every on e us es the d ate of No ve m b er 3 r d .
I never could have a part y .
This is not a b ir th day day , this is a b ir th day week . )
A m on g my friend s we have a tra d i tion to not give the present s on the proper day .
- I ' ll give it to you la ter , when you w o n ' t expect it .
So , I ' m already so us ed to this that when they present ed me something it was more un e x pe c ted .
Even my brother , who never re m e m b er s the d ate of my b ir th day ( but you can see it ' s not a pro ble m ) ) , told me that everything that I pai n t s u c k s and present ed me with a picture . )
No w I ' m think ing all my present s are so am us ing , so f an c y , is it because they re ally are , or because I did n ' t expect it ? )
I did mathematics and J a p an e se . It was f un that I did home w or k .
In S um m er va c ation , I went to the country to tea ch students .
P e op le say that is s up p or ting education .
I think that is mean ing ful ly .
when I was a ch il d , I had a dr e a m to help other s .
B e f or e my de p ar ture , I had to do many things unti l 2 4 : 0 0 .
Even though I was tired , I was ha p p y .
When I was stand ing at the po d i um , I was very n er v ous .
But the students were very friend ly , they help ed me comp le te my first show .
A fter a long time , I ' m writing a di ar y again .
I ' m do ing M i ll it ar y S er v ic e in the K or e a A ir F or ce .
So I had V o l un te er ed . .
My mi ll it ar y s er v ic e re m a in s about 1 5 0 day s .
I ' d like to ha ng out other in another are a and find some good stuff next time : )
A woman re c ent ly w ro te a heart b re a k ing con f es s ion in the co un se ling se ction of a ma g a z in e that I read .
She was ra p ed short ly after being w ed .
The ra p is t was her s is ter - in - law ' s hu s b and .
He r hu s b and was being treat ed at a ho s p it al and her s is ter - in - law was at the ho s p it al to visit him at that time .
The woman told her s is ter - in - law about the incident .
He r hu s b and and her s is ter in law prefer to s a ve themselves from e m b ar r as s ment .
He r s is ter in law a d op ted the woman ' s so n as an act to re d e e m her hu s b and ' s bad de ed .
U p unti l now , her so n knew her as his a un t .
A n y s an e mother would l o ve to be re c o g n i z ed by her own f le s h and b l o o d but tell ing the tru th might make the so n ha te the or i g in of his ex is t ence .
No t because of his p ur e l o ve of G o d .
To day I read an ar t ic le about different way s to be ha p p y .
One of them is to write five it e m s about something that you like d , every day
I did n ' t go to school to day
I was at ar t school , we pai n ted with water co l o ur s at last
I at e a y um m y b ar of ch o c o l ate
I heard / told a funny j o ke .
write your five it e m s in the commen t s , if it is n ' t difficult for you = )
Why are c at s so c ut e ! ?
O h , I did nothing to day because of You T u b e and c at s . . .
I always wish that I were ( strong er ) .
But I know that think ing about that is no n s en se , so I try ing to not think .
There ' s no change with me , and I am s ame as b e f or e .
( S pe a k ing is still not good ) I still c a n ' t speak very well and c a n ' t de s c ri b e what I think to my friend s .
I want to speak and have a more p le as ant con ver s ation ( p le as ant ly m or e ) with my friend .
I have to think in more simple terms ( things simpl y ) .
ho pe ful ly , I will get better ( and talk ing ) at speak ing w e ll more than I don ow .
I went to the mar ke t and b ough t some ing r ed i ent s :

I went out on the de c k from the di n ing room after my me al .
The view from the de c k was very beautiful .
A fter I got off the boat , I went to C h id or i g a f u ch i and the Ya s u k un i - S h ri ne

J a p an e se people call it `` O h an a m i . ``
C h id or i g a f u ch i and the Ya s k un i - S h ri ne are l o c at ed around the I m pe ri al P al a ce .
It was be st time for O h an a m i .
The ch er ry b l o s s o m s are in full b l o o m right now .
D o you know about O h an a m i ?

U s ing the sub way in S e o ul ! : D

In the st ation , there is a small ga ll er y , G w an g H w a la ng , which you can see for free .
It is small , but you can a p p re c i ate the picture s and pai n ting s .
O m is o k a is a J a p an e se w or d that mean s `` the last day of a year . ``
I do n ' t know why we do the se things , but they are our tra d i tion s and I can feel the end of the year when we do them .
A re you co un ting down with your family , friend s or l o ver ?
It was re ally sweet to re un ite my p ar ent s in E ur o pe .
To c le an se your s k in mean s not only just to was h your face but includ ing to take your make up off ?
Yes ter day I went sh op p ing to get my f a c i al stuff and a c l er k asked me how I c le an se my s k in , but I did n ' t understand she mean t to say only to was h my face or to was h make - up off ?
And if you suggest s u it able w or d s for me to know , tell me some please .

I s ' The E x c it ing S at ur day ' c or re c t translation ? `` A n E x c it ing S at ur day ``
This was my so n ' s e le ment ar y school even t .
A t the entrance bo o th * , he show ed a st amp ma p which was give n at school and I asked the re ce p tion is t for one more st amp ma p for my d aught er .
There were many game s , such as , H ul a - H o op T h r ow ing G ame ( a comp e t i tion on how long they th r ow ) , C at ch ing P a p er With C h op st ic k s , S c o op ing W at er W a ll o on , D ro p p ing 1 Y en C o in to the b in s in an a qu ar i um tank , P it ch ing G ame , and so on .
A l s o there were sh op s s el ling j u ic e and c he a p sweet s
the se c he a p sweet s are called `` da g ash i `` .
And there was a bo o th g i v ing s n ow c up with s y r up s as a present to those who play ed three game s .
There was a tea ce re m on y bo o th .
That s open ed from 9 : 0 0 to 1 3 : 0 0 .
We almost end ed the game at 1 2 : 0 0 , so we return ed home .
We went there with the b i ke and that was my so n ' s first time to ri d e his b i ke to going some where .
I was an no y ed with his a c c id ent s but he can ri d e s a f e ly .
When we return ed home , we me t a for e i g n teacher and a p up il girl from an English S ch o o l .
I thought that they would go to the even t .
this is the co m m un ity ' s even t .
So , if the school is a me m b er of this ne i g h b or h o o d co m m un ity ,
they should go there .
A t 1 6 : 1 0 , my so n will go to his s w im m ing school .
I ' ll leave my d aught er at my p ar ent ' s home and go the e le ment ar y school .
I think I would be able to come home after 3 0 minute s , so I told him that if ti f no one was home , please wait at the entrance of the a p ar t ment bu il d ing . . . . .
W i ll I be in time before he come s home ?
I ' d better mo ve on !
I read about them in ma g a z in es but never listen ed to their so ng s very serious ly .
However , that was such an am a z ing show that it st ir r ed my interest in the b and !
M an y j a p an e se comp an ies a d op ted a t est for job hu n ting .
The name of the t est is S P I 2 .
One half of it is ma th , the other half J a p an e se .
why , why do many comp an ies want to t est L in e ar f un ction s and F a c t or i z ation ?
I m a g in e you want to bu y a me l on for 5 0 0 yen ( f i x ed p ri ce ) . You have 1 0 0 yen co in s , 5 0 yen co in s and 1 0 yen co in s .
How many way s of pay ing the me l on do ex is t ?
You can us e only two kind s of co in s .
S P I 2 make s me c r a z y . . .
L ate ly , I ` ve been listen ing to the ra d i o while study ing .
It ' s ' L a z y so ng ' by B r un o M ar s .
The P V of it is very interest ing .
He s ing s and dance s with the mo n ke y s .
It ' s my c at s c ry ing ( y e a h , it ' s re ally c ry ing and to day is not an ex ce p tion ) for be g g ing me to fee d them .
But one of the c at s name d `` W ow `` has a much loud er voice than the other c at s .
He has re ally `` w ow `` voice es pe c i ally when he us ed to as k for something to eat .
But most ly , they are very quiet and sp en d their time sleep ing .
Some time s I wish I were a c at and sleep all day and they were hu man to fee d me .
What is three - people le ar n ing ?
If you le ar n only by he ar ing , you will easily for g e t , but if you addition ally tell some on e what you have le ar n ed , it will be hard to for g e t .
To tea ch some on e is not only about some on e else ' s le ar n ing , but it also make s it hard to for g e t what you le ar n ed .
How to le ar n the f un d a ment al s of other language s
The first s te p in study ing language
I str u g g led to find the way to le ar n other language s e f f ic i ent ly . ( or effect ive ly ) .
I did n ' t have enough money to go to a language school ,
so I have to study by myself .
A fter 5 year s of look ing , I found one of the way s to understand the found ation of other language s .
I think we have to f i ll our bra in with the f un d a ment al sen t ence s of the new language .
When we have to us e the language ,
the sen t ence s will appear a ut o m at ic ally .
To f i ll up your bra in with the sen t ence s ,
It ' s good to he ar , to speak , to read and to write the sen t ence any number of time s .
F or p r a c t ic ing this way there is a te x t p u b l ish ed by M ar u z en , [ T O I E C tra n ing ] s er ies .
This te x t explain s the way of f un d a ment al train ing .
O f course the me th o d can be a p p l i ed to other te x t s con tain ing f un d a ment al sen ten se s with C D
When you try this me th o d at first ,
I re c o m m en d you us e this te x t .
It ' s e f f ic i ent for le ar n ing the c or re c t way .
No w I will a p p ly this me th o d for le ar n ing C h in e se .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to the day that I can explain the effect ive ness of this me th o d for ga in ing ability in for e i g n language s .
A cha t on the p h on e
I got a call from an old friend .
I ' m still mar ri ed .
I know I ' m a work - a - ho l ic , right now .
and I for g e t how to enjoy my life . . . . .
I had a night m ar e last night .
It was about me being in the ar m y .
However , it was not p l an n ed and there was e v id ence .
As soon as police started a sea r ch , I was ar re st ed by them .
While I had a trouble d mind , I p re ten d ed to not be a c ri m in al .
And then I w o ke up .
This morning a tru c k hi t a p ed est ri an on the street .
G o ing to a C h ur ch for the F ir st T im e
In C h in a , C h ri st i an be l i e f s are not wide s p re ad .
S p en d ing a for e i g n f est i v al like C h ri st m as in a `` for e i g n `` place see m s very interest ing .
To day , I ' d like to write about a way of think ing .
There are a l ot of think ing style s and they are p u b l ish ed in some business b ook s .
I am face d with a l ot of way s .
O f c ous e the be st way is different , but I act u ally think it is w or th think ing about the conc ept of de s i g n ing .
L ook ing for the es s ent i al e le ment s is a good conc ept for do ing something c re at ive , I think .
I ' ve mo w ed all of the f i el d where my mother gr ow s ve g e t able s .
My mother was sat is f i ed with the clear ed f i el d .
B e c a us e my w if e does n ' t like pe ar s very much , I do n ' t get the ch ance to eat them of ten even though I like them .
B e c a us e of a tra f f ic j a m on the high way , while we were on the w in d ing and r u g g ed ro ad , the s un almost went down .
A t that moment , I could n ' t help but im a g in e whether something would r us h up and show it s el f s ud d en ly .
You know what I ' m talk ing about : `` The T e x as C ha in s a w M as s a c re . `` ! !
I ' m the kind of person who gr e w up in a big c ity , so I have less ch ance to have con ta c t with nature .
D ur ing the 2 - day tri p , I p ic k ed up w o o d , ro d e an A T V ( all - ter r a in ve h ic le ) on a w o o d ed p a th , and o b s er v ed de er and ho g s .
And that mean s the ex a m s are right around the corner .
O h no ! A g a in !
It see m s that the C h in e se students are more an x i ous before ex a m s , comp ar ed to the students of other n ation s .
P er ha p s it is d u e to our education s y s te m - you come to school to study , the school give s you a mar k on your paper .
That ' s all .
M a y b e this opinion is too ra d ical , we should try to see things in different light s .
We see the world through our co l or ed g la s se s .
I m p ar t i al ity is what every on e p ur s u es , but no one re ally s u c ce ed s .
Well , no more talk ing .
The ex a m s are my p ri or ity now .
S t ud y , and get a good mar k !
I take two English class es at U n ive r s ity .
The other is in ten d ed for J a p an e se students .
M o st students are act ive in the class .
I think the teacher tri es to tea ch ent h us i a st ic ally , and he is good teacher .
I have already me m or i z ed the te x t b ook before ent er ing un ive r s ity .
But the sit u ation has change d since ent er ing un ive r s ity .
We have to think de e p ly and I have to act b as ed on my will .
So , I try to ar gue with many people as well as me m or i z e the know led g e .
M a y b e in other co un t ri es it is stand ar d that students have a ch ance to dis c us s , but
The go ver n ment need s to change the education s y s te m . . .
L i b r ar y , you are the most p re c i ous place I have ever go ne .
If you will as k me what is the be st place I have ever go ne ,
my answer would be the l i b r ar y .
When I was still a fresh man in a un ive r s ity , I had this feel ing of being so free
like a b ir d that had f led from the c age .
The only thing that I had in my mind was I will only do the things that I like to do .
But now I know that it is a da ng er ous idea .
T h in k ing that no one can stop me from what I want to do sound s like a good idea .
But in re al ity , it may be ha r m ful for me .
Why is it ha r m ful for me ? It is because I am a d d ic ted to comp ut er game s .
I had been play ing comp ut er game s for about half a year
unti l one day , when I entered a l i b r ar y ,
the very first thing that I saw there was the she l ve s of b ook s .
I like English , so I p ic k ed up an English no ve l ti t led `` P ri d e and P re j ud ic e `` , a f a m ous no ve l written by J an e A us ten .
I like the no ve l so much that I read it s ever al time s .
Then I found myself in l o ve with read ing a no ve l . F ro m that time , I read l ot s of no ve l by different a u th or s . .
That is the reason why l i b r ar y is the most p re c i ous place I have r go ne in my co ll e g e life .
The reason why I j o in ed this sit e is to im p ro ve my English s k i ll to study a b ro ad in near future .
So , I ' ll a p p re c i ate all your me s s age s .
He ll o !
I live in In ch e on with my family and p up p y .
I want to speak English well !
I will try !
I go to H an s h in U n ive r s ity .
M a th is so hard , but I like it .
I ha te to m at o es .
I do n ' t like how to m at o es s m e ll .
My favor ite act i v ity is play ing with my p up p y .
I l o ve my p up p y .
Some time s I for g ot to do , because of my bu s y work , or he a v y dr in k ing . . .
So , I want to con t in u e do ing it .
I thought it would be interest ing to as k .
may b e my English is w or se than before : ( I ' ve been bu s y , but I know I ' ve got ta study hard . . . .
I c a n ' t think what I w an n a write any m or e . . . : (
she will come back to O s a k a this s um m er : D
I visit ed the V at ic an m us e um , the P ant he on , the T re v i F o un tain , the C o l o s se um , the P i a z z a di S p a g n a , the
Then I went to F I R E N Z E by the E ur o st ar train .
The R O M A and F I R E N Z E are am a z ing town s .
T h an k s
T h an k s friend s for ( read ing / answer ing ? ) my me s s age .
A n y way , than k s .
and I live in Ka g o s h im a .
I am study ing English .
but I have a l ot of English w or d s that I do n ' t know .
The di ction ar y is very he a v y .
I watch ed a mo v i e name d L an Y u
This f il m talk ed about ga y guy s
K in d a like B ro ke b a c k M o un tain ~
The act or was Y e L i u
S e e m s this mo v i e is his f a m ous one
because he w in the T a i w an ' s G o l d en H or se ' s B est A c t or
but it ' s not ha p p y end ing
c u z Y e L i u di ed at last
A l o ve about two me n
A l o ve de e p er than a man and a woman
I think some time s may b e I can watch B ro ke b a c k M o un tain
I still like the l o ve when it ' s about man and woman
I think S k y pe is very us e ful for le ar n ing a for e i g n language .
However , speak ing and listen ing are more difficult to le ar n because you have little op p or t un ity to talk with a person who speak s your le ar n ing language .
The tru th is / act u ally , I ' m very sh y ! ! !
I wish I had the co ur age ! ! !
To day , I will in t ro d u ce one of my favor ite s ing er s , A ng e la A k i .
R e c ent ly , she ' s got ten f a m ous in J a p an .
( * _ * ) So I ra n to m us ic st or e to bu y her C D the next day .
It was a n ic e C D .
He r conc er t was also n ic e !
He r talk was am us ing .
The X ' ma s conc er t will be he l d in B ud o u k an , which is one of the big g est ha ll s in D e ce m b er .
If you want to know more about her , please c he c k W i k i p ed i a or her we b s ite .
It ' ll help you , but I do n ' t know if it is c or re c t i nformation . ( ^ _ ^ ; )
This is `` H O M E `` . The first so ng I heard by her .
To day , in the new s to day two big comp an ies are me r g ing in J a p an .
K ir in which is a co m m on comp an y , which part of the M it s u b ish i - a f f il i at ed comp an ies .
S ant or y is a family own comp an y in O s a k a .
I like K ir in re m on , and S ant or y ' s be er .
In ch in a , pe a p le dr in k S ant or y ' s be er more than ch in e se be er .
We are surprise d by the new s !
C an ad a D o ll ar sha p ed ch o c o l ate !
I was give n the se ch o c o l ate and C an ad i an co in s by my C an ad i an friend who came back from C an ad a .
The ma p le le a f is re ally n ic e .
I think it is more beautiful than the 1 0 c ent co in !
The other day , an e ar th qu a ke happen ed in the United States .
I f e ar ed the w or st when I heard about it .
B e c a us e , when it happen ed I was re m in d ed of 3 . 1 1 .
But , there were no de a th s in this e ar th qu a ke .
In J a p an , there was a little small e ar th qu a ke two days before 3 . 1 1 .
I ho pe that the e ar th qu a ke in A m er ic a was not a for es h ock .
[ 5 ] Why do you read such a strange b ook that has picture s of a l ot of an im al l s ' hi p s in it ?
But without s u f f ic i ent comp ut er s k i ll s you will get con f us ed by your ma c some time s , here are some ti p s & trick s I have found from my da i ly us e .
I finish ed p re p ar ing dinner and now I am dr in k ing gr e en tea .
This after no on , I will part ic i p ate in a study s es s ion .
D ur ing the study s es s ion , I take my ch il d re n to a n ur se ry next do or .
I still can not de c id e whether to part ic i p ate in to day ' s study s es s ion .
F or near ly a week , the ch il d re n have c ri ed all night , and we are tired .
He re I have an English n at ive friend !
So each of us need s each other s ' help .
However , it is a little difficult to me e t with a n at ive speak er .
F or t un ate ly , I have got ten help from two of them .
B e c a us e I have ha y f ever .
I mi s s the little girl that live d inside of me
G r ow ing up is a pai n ful and l u c k y thing .
A t that time I ha d done and said l ot s of fool ish things .
A t that time I was j ust a co w ar d ly girl who g ot / receiv ed un f a ir treat ment from other s and c o ul d n ' t stand up for her s el f .
A t that time I was j ust an u g ly d u c k ling who se my class m ate s thought was u g ly and treat ed as nothing .
But at that time I was kind I never go s s i p ed about other s .
A t that time I w as than k ful t o any on e who w as being kind to me .
A t that time I l o v ed look ing at s k y just because it was p ur e b l u e .
No w , I ' m not that little girl any m or e .
I think t w ic e before I speak . I can hu r t other s back if they ever hu r t me .
I have people who back me up , because they like me .
I don t have time to look at the s k y any m or e , since I am bu s y g i v ing other s who I need a b a b y like smile to make them like me and read ing l ot s and l ot s fashion ma g .
L ook ing at the p h ot o I took when I w as a kid , the p a th etic little girl ( I see ) is so o o o o u g ly .
If you me t a u g ly short sh y little girl please be n ic e to her , don t hu r t her or do anything to let her change , let her be an a ng el for a little while more .
C an you de s c ri b e a co ll e a gue that you work with ?
He is always s m il ing .
He is also short , only 1 7 0 c m . ta ll .
He we ar s g la s se s , and always we ar s co t t on p ant s .
The next day , a re un ion part y will be he l d and I will me e t my old class m ate s at my e le ment ar y school .
I work ed in the sh op as a volunteer in the morning and I went to y o g a class in the even ing .
The S up er M o on is a mo on which is near est to the e ar th and it is full mo on at the same time .
It is kind of an o v al .
And a ccord ing to some new s , it is the first time in 1 9 year s !
I should re f le c t on myself who did no ne of the things which I had de c id ed to do .
I can p r a c t ic e my English and J a p an e se a l ot and me e t for e i g n people here !
When we go for a ri d e , we speak in English .
On hot days , of course we dr in k co l d be er and on co l d days in w in ter we also l o ve co l d be er with hot dis he s .
On the con t r ar y the up p er class people in E ng l and l o ve to dr in k be er at room te m p er a ture .
If it is tru e , please tell me the reason .
D o es it depend on the c l im ate ?
When my ho st f a ther dr an k be er with ic e , I thought it was very strange .
B e c a us e it was the first time I ' d see n this .
I s this normal for people in the U .
I like K y ot o .
I ma j or ed in me ch an ical te ch no l o g y , sp e c if ic ally he at transfer .
I de ve l op new pro d u c t s of a ir condition er s ma k ing us e of the te ch no l o g ies I have le ar n t the se days .
There f or e , I go to K y ot o s ever al time s a year with my family .
I like the ga r d en of G in k a ku j i - temple ( S il ver temple ) .
I like T e t s u g a ku - no - mi ch i ( P h il o s op h er s ' tra il ) , too .
It has been over a week since the e ar th qu a ke and T s un a m i hi t J a p an .
I believe that my office bu il d ing is e ar th qu a ke - pro o f , but now the bu il d ing is n ' t as strong as before .
But any way , my English teacher t aught me a very n ic e p h r a se : `` E ver y c l o ud has a s il ver l in ing ``
M or e o ver we will need to im p ro ve our live s and get make them better than before the e ar th qu a ke !
F in ally I have started L an g - 8 .
My English s k i ll s are n ' t per f e c t yet ,
but I will le ar n English per f e c t ly .
B e c a us e some on e will tea ch me English .
J a p an e se is my mother to n gue and I can speak G er man f l u ent ly and English limit ed .
I st ud i ed S w ed ish and C h in e se in co ll e g e in G er man y for one year because of those interest ing into n ation s .
I gradua ted in the sp r ing of 2 0 1 0 and started work ing in the a ut um n of the same year .
I w an n a im p ro ve my English s k i ll s , but I ' m too la z y to study English . . .
So at least I try watch ing D V D s in English , to write di ar y every day and to read paper s about language a c qu is i tion , p h on etic s e t c in English .
U n t il re c ent ly , I thought that most people are r ud e and a ng ry , so , to be honest , I did n ` t like them .
E ver y s un day I go to the ch o ir p r a c t ic e at 1 1 o ` clock .
That day my father brought me there .
A fter 1 0 minute s , I found out that my teacher and friend s - s ing er s / the other s ing er s were not there . . .
There f or / So I de c id ed to go home .
Then I found out that I had no money to pay the bu s !
And my street was so far away !
But un e x pe c ted ly I got an idea !
I could call my father and as k him to take me home !
I not ic ed a l ad stand ing near the c a f e who was listen ing to m us ic .
I asked him what I want ed and he smile d , g i v ing me his `` no k i a `` .
I smile d in respon se back and di al ed my father ' s number .
But my father / da d was too far away , so he could n ` t help me !
I saw 1 0 r u ble s la y ing in my hand .
I hung up and looked at the man / l ad .
I re ally did n ` t know what to say , ex c ept for a loud and since re `` T h an k you very much ! `` .
It ' s not a very great de al , but I think that now a day s kind ness is the her o ic de ed !

She has a M al a y s i an friend who had a j a p an e se hu s b and .
This is the story about his f un er al .
The me th o d of the M us l im f un er al is the bu ri al .

H is w if e f a in ted many time s and c ri ed , and then the teacher was s c ar ed of the hu man bo ne and re ally ha ted catch ing the bo ne with ch op st ic k s !
I have n ' t thought that the bo ne was s c ar y .
And be s id es , I have see n this happen many time s now .
A fter all , is every body s c ar ed of the hu man bo ne ?

My father is as ta ll as me , he has w h ite ha ir and he is f at .
Then my teacher said , `` f at ! ? `` .
She and the other p up il s thought that J a p an e se people are usual ly th in .
But I did n ' t think that he was very f at , like for e i g n people are .
But he is a little f at ter than me .
And they knew of `` s um o `` , so they said `` s um o w re st l er s are f at , are n ' t they ? ``
So I ' m very ha p p y that they know of `` s um o `` .
It is difficult to explain , but I always r u in my life .
When everything is bad I try to be strong , ha p p y , help ful , and c he er ful , but when everything is great I begin to see m s s ad , and n er v ous .
may b e some on e know s the answer or has an idea . W ri te as soon as possible !
You can take E S L ( English as a S e c on d L an g u age ) class es which are he l d in the United States on your T V .
The class is he l d in N e w Y or k C ity in the United States .
So if I w a c th it , I could take the class with them without going to N e w Y or k .
The teachers speak only in English , and students do too .
I think that it ' s a good ch ance for some on e who is going to study a b ro ad in the future , but also any on e who want to study a b ro ad in their own home !
To day I f in ally got my new I D C ar d .
A t no on , after I had la un ch , I went to the ra il way st ation ( and b ough t O R to bu y ) tomorrow ' s ti c ke t to go to N an J ing .

J a p an e se English is easy for me to understand .
In d i an English is hard for me to understand .
English is the / an in ter n ation al language , so it ' s natural that it has a wide va ri e ty .
The meeting is in English only .

The other is f e ar of not being p re p ar ed well enough to get pai d by some on e for my work .
D op ing P and a is one of my favor ite ar t is t s .
When I heard them for the first time , I became one of their f an s direct ly .
I want to go to their live conc er t . . but no one want s to go with me .
The live conc er t is going to be he l d on next J un e and J u ly .
I am think ing about whether I go alone or not .

It see m s that I do not need to we ar s c ar f any more .
To day , I was at my part - time job .
The people that work there are also re ally n ic e !
While I was on the train , I was listen ing to C N N new s on my i P o d .
M or e o ver , the con t ent s are difficult for me .
G en er ally , I listen to B B C , and I can catch what they are saying . . .
P l us I can not find the s c ri p t s on the In ter ne t . . .
so I can not understand what they say .
To m or r ow I will watch some mo v ies at home !

However , too l us e , we a p on ry , c ul ture , and s y m b o l ic co m m un ic ation , which were once thought to be un i qu e to hu man s , have now been found in ch im p s and other sp e c ies .
G l o b al i z ation has been ex ten d ing even to in ter n ation al mar ri age s l ate ly .
I ra n a cross an ar t ic le to day , which dis c us s ed about `` in ter n ation al mar ri age `` .
In that ar t ic le , it see m s that the J a p an e se go ver n ment has been wonder ing if it should sign the H a gue C on ve n tion or not .
B e c a us e there are different way s of think ing regard ing mar ri age and family among those from other co un t ri es .
On the train I saw a b a b y girl in a b a b y c ar ri age who was saying to her mother `` M o m , mo m ! `` and seemed to want her mother to pay at ten tion to her .
This scene re m in d ed me of the sit u ation that a girl want ed her bo y f ri en d to do so .
The b a b y ' s mother told the b a b y to be c al m , but the b a b y con t in u ed .

We c a n ' t gr ow them ar t if ic i ally , so they only gr ow in very de e p for est s .
It mean s that M at s ut a ke is very difficult to get , so they are very ex p en s ive .
Some of them are about $ 4 0 per piece !
But people can only enjoy M at s ut a ke in a ut um un , and many J a p an e se people tri es to eat them .
M an y J a p an e se people think M at s ut a ke is very de l ic i ous .

So , I had six less on s to day .
They were : m us ic , b i o l o g y , U k r a in i an language , P T , English and g e o g r a p h y .

He is a f a m ous j o ur n al is t in J a p an .
The them e was the pro ble m of g un s in A m er ic a .
In that moment , I understood us age of `` H O W M A N Y `` more than the pro ble m of g un s .
You might be surprise d that I le ar n ed English 1 5 year s a g o , but still do n ' t know how to write a j o ur n al ent ry .

I tri ed to find out another way to get back my home to day .
I f i g ur ed out that there are many different way s .
Then , I was able to return home by tak ing the other ro ad s .
It was a great ex pe ri ence for me !
I ' m not sure where we ' re going , but we ' ll be sure to go some where where we can have k ing c r a b . My bo y f ri en d may not want to go , because he always feel s tired . He ' s y a w ing at the moment , but I will make him come along .
I went to N ar a with friend s : ) D o you know about the N ar a p re f e c ture ? ?
It is near O s a k a , and K y ot o .
There are old temple s and his t or ical place s .

In there , many de er walk any where in free d o m : D They look very c ut e : ) and are always c al m .
But they were follow ing us as soon as they understand that we had c ook ies for de er .
D e er c ook ies are called `` S h i k a - sen b e i `` in J a p an e se .
I was s ur r ound ed by de er , so I felt s c ar ed a b it .
I had a s c ar y ex pe ri ence yesterday . ( good sen t ence )
O h , I am very tired : p
B i g and He a v y . . .
I went to my mother ' s house to help her .

We de c id ed to call a s al v age comp an y to ha ul them away .

I heard m us c le is he a v i er than f at .
I s it effect ive to walk when on a di e t ?
What is the be st way to go on a di e t . . . ?
I just watch ed the mo v i e `` H i g h S ch o o l M us ical 1 `` .
I wish T ro y and G a b ri el la would get along well in the mo v i e and in re al life as well .
and I ' m going to the e ul j i un ive r s ity
I am going to have a n ur s ing class .
it is very difficult .
and I have l un ch at 1 2 p m
and then I ' m going to talk to my friend .
this is the end of my first English di ar y ent ry !
I s it co m m on to me e t re l at ive s d ur ing on N e w Y e ar ' s D a y in your co un t ri es ?
If you ' d like to sea r ch for any s y n on y m s in J a p an e se easily ,
I suggest that you should us e this di ction ar y .
I of ten us e it to en ri ch my J a p an e se writing .
No w I ' m sea r ch ing for English ver s ion like this .
D o you know some good we b s ite s ?
E x change language
H i again , this time round I want to as k for some on e ' s help who is le ar n ing S p an ish .
My in ter p er s on al s k i ll for English is better than my writing however I need more p r a c t ic e .
I do n ' t mind if your in ter p er s on al s k i ll for S p an ish is not very good , I think that if we work to g e ther , we can im p ro ve our qu al it ies .
If you are the so r t of person that I ' m look ing for , please con ta c t me .
I ra n to work as I was listen ing to M J ' s so ng s this morning in we t we a ther g e ar because it was ra in ing hard .
I want ed to run more , but I did n ' t have enough time because the dance less on was wait ing for me .
The so ng s ga ve me a l ot of en er g y to run .
I ' m going to run home , listen ing to his so ng s , again ^ ^
It ' s not my business but their own .
My w if e always told me that I should write about serious to p ic s , us ing for m al w or d s and express ion s like what other J a p an e se people do .
What kind of to p ic s do you usual ly talk with your friend s ?
D o you of ten us e for m al w or d s and with a straight face on your usual con ver s ation s ?
No way .
When I was still living in J a p an , I always cha t ted ( con ver s ed ) with my friend s about many to p ic s , ra ng ing from the s i z e of our di c k s to the cause of g l o b al w ar m ing in J a p an .
M or e than 8 0 % of our to p ic s were quite st up id .
However , this is a re al co m m un ic ation . D o n ' t you think so ?
I ' m not saying for m al English express ion s are not im p or t ant .
But writing and read ing about only serious to p ic s is pretty b or ing for me .
In my opinion , hi t ting on a l o c al girl , ma k ing friend s with the l o c al s , and having ar g u ment s about the J a p an e se p or n c ar t o on in d ust ry can im p ro ve our English .
If you do n ' t know how to us e bad w or d s , it mean s you c a n ' t c ur se other people . There f or e , you c a n ' t have an ar g u ment with a n at ive speak er .
If you do n ' t know how to de s c ri b e something by us ing st up id express ion s , it mean s you c a n ' t make other people laugh .
So you c a n ' t make a l o c al girl friend and and make friend s among the l o c al s .
Why c a n ' t you become st up id on L an g 8 ?
You re ally want to im p ro ve your English , right ?
I ' ve written about the p ri m ar y game s before .
But yesterday ' s game was not a p ri m ar y game .
Yes ter day K or e a play ed it s first game of the f in al s with G re e ce .
I do n ' t know what is different between ' the f in al ' and ' the f in al s ' .
L e e j un g s u and P ar k j i s un g each s c or ed a go al .
The funny story is that to day I was look ing at N a ver
P e op le said he has such n ic e manner s .
He has show n class even though his country has no money .
I saw picture s about that .
K or e a ' s next game is on the 1 7 th with A r g ent in a .
I ' m sorry to A r g ent in a , but I ho pe K or e a will w in that game too .
To day our country has a ma t ch with A r g ent in a .
A r g ent in a is know n as a great so c c er p ow er .
So our country is also a little w or ri ed about get ting our as se s
st o m p ed . L O L too funny !
I ho pe so !
My bra in free z es , and I gue s s the only thing I do n ' t for g e t do ing is b re at he .
Some time s I think I would never be able to keep my g en in the da ta b a se of the world . ( ha , ha )
M a k ing a b re a k th r ough w o n ' t be easy , but I suppose that ' s I have to face the cha ll e ng e even t u ally .
When I was cha t ting with my friend on F a ce b ook , she told me about this great S N S s er v ic e that I had never heard of before .
P ro b ably , I will become a d d ic ted to this S N S and try to up l o ad my da il ies ( da i ly thought s ? ) .
So , I have to write something about myself .
R e c ent ly , I am re ally interest ed in one b ook . This b ook is not a no ve l or es s a y .
This b ook is ti t led `` How to eat 3 me al s - a - day for 9 0 0 0 Y E N a month . ``
No w I re ally a d m i re his style and am try ing to a b s or b his idea s .
However , if I try to a d a p t to his di e t , I can not eat a l ot of me at . . .
( I was think ing of going to a hotel re st a ur ant to have b re a k f a st to day . ) - more natural sound ing
( It is said that to go to hotel re st a ur ant is a good way to re fresh our mind . )
( H aving a me al at a different place make s us re fresh ed . )
( L a st night I went to be d e ar ly but I was in be d unti l 8 o ' clock in the morning . . . )
to sh ock some body
I know that if you `` sh ock `` some body , it mean s that you `` make them surprise d or up se t `` .
D o es it further m or e mean that you `` make them s ad `` or `` hu r t their feel ing s `` ?
T im e f l ies d ur ing c la s s .
When I entered through the do or , I gr e e ted my class m ate s in the class .
A fter two hour s , the class end ed .
I like to study English all the time .
One of my b and ' s me m b er s , H id e !
He ' s kind of a c r a z y guy .
He bu il t a st ud i o in his a p ar t ment last year because
he did n ' t want to pay money every time he went to
J ust once , the ne i g h b or knock ed on the do or a ng ri ly , but that was re ally f un !
However , we ' ve take n it down since the day before yesterday and
f in ally , we re - bu il t it to day !
M o st of my b and ' s me m b er s work as c ar p ent er s so
they re ally knew how to de - con st r u c t ? it .
Some on e t aught me how to us e the `` business us e machi ne `` and I p ul led n a il s from the hard w o o d .
It was the d ul le st work , and made us so tired .
We ' re a b and of m us ic i an s , but to day was different like we were
While we work ed all day , I thought our bo n d got strong er
I ho pe that our m us ical bo n d get s strong er like to day s work .
He ll o - In t ro d u c ing My s el f
It ` s my first time on this we b s ite , and I don ` t know how to us e it a p p ro p ri ate ly , but I ho pe that I will me e t new friend s and they will help me .
I would like to speak English f l u ent ly , but I do not have friend s who speak English , so I have been le ar n ing English for s ever al year s , and my know led g e is still not enough ! ! ! !
A year and 5 month s have go ne by since I left J a p an .
I can say , it went by s l ow and f a st .
( I know only No r th A m er ic a ' s life s ty le as I ' ve never live d in another are a . )
M an y J a p an e se people who I ' ve me t here said , they want to return to J a p an , but they do n ' t want to work there ( in J a p an ) , because it ' s difficult to find a job with the same work ing condition s as in C an ad a .
M on th ly salary in Tokyo is de f in ite ly better , but you have to work l ate every day and work even d ur ing the week en d .
On ce they get us ed to work ing over se as , it might be di f f c ul t to return to J a p an .
I do n ' t know why , but J a p an e se people , es pe c i ally the one work ing in Tokyo are ex t re m e ly bu s y .
I ' ve got mi x ed feel ing s , I feel like return ing to my for m er job , and living in Tokyo since my friend s are still there , but I just c a n ' t return to that life s ty le .
I thought my c a p ability to le ar n would only gr ow unti l about 2 0 year s old , as well as my he i g h t .
A fter that , it would de c re a se with age .
F or ex amp le , when I was in high school , my gra d es were so bad that I could n ' t ent er a me d school .
I ga ve up my dr e a m of becom ing a me d ical do c t or and I entered another un ive r s ity ' s F a c ul ty of S c i ence .
But there I st ud i ed very hard .
And in my re se ar ch act i v ity about on c o l o g y , I thought I did n ' t have any ch o ic e but to ent er a me d school to study the me d ic in e .
Even t u ally I became a me d ical st ud ent .
( In J a p an , in F e b r u ar y there are entrance ex a m s for most un ive r s it ies . )
S n ow f e ll yesterday e ar ly in the morning but it me l ted .
To day is a little b it w ar m .
M a y b e sp r ing is around the corner .
I made a f e w p l an s .
On S at ur day , I ' m going to ha ng out with my friend and we will ri d e our b i ke s .
I had a pro ble m with our p l an s .
I already made an a p po in t ment with my other f ri en d s .
A re there any so l u tion s that all ow me to keep all my p l an s ?
I like for e i g n an im ation s .
I like `` F o s ter ' s home for im a g in ar y friend s `` the most !
S u ch a story can not easily be see n in J a p an .
I have poor English s k i ll s , but some day I want to speak it well because the an im ation is very interest ing .
F ro m time to time I am going to write something interest ing here .
It is l o c at ed at the c ent er of the C ri m e an p en in s ul a .
There are just about 6 0 0 th ous and people living here .
I ' m sure of get ting a bad s c or e .
My name is R in .
I ' m study ing English for business .
T h ough I read many English do c u ment s l ate ly , I do n ' t understand very much of what they say .
E ver y on e , please help me le ar n English .
To day , I went on a business tri p to Ka w as a k i c ity .
I always go to Ka w as a k i c ity on business tri p s , because our p ar ent comp an y is in Ka w as a k i c ity .
U s u ally when I go to Ka w as a k i c ity , I go to Y o d o b ash i C ame r a , To u k y u u H an z u and B ic C ame r a for sh op p ing .
And so I some time s eat ra m en around the Ka w as a k i st ation .
B e c a us e I of ten eat ra m en , I have go ne to all ra m en re st a ur ant around the Ka w as a k i st ation .
We had a good day last s un day .
We were so l u c k ly .
It did n ' t ra in when we were outside .
When we were le aving it started ra in ing .
D o you like t ul i p s ?
H a ve been to a T ul i p f est i v al ?
I like it though .
A ll people put their c l o th es on .
Some + people we ar class y c l o th es , other s we ar sha g g y one s .
F ir st of all , people ch o o se their c l o th es themselves every day .
C l o th es can express people ' s C l o th es can express people ' s feel ing s .
This in d ic ate s that people + can express their character s through o ut their c l o th es .
S e c on d ly , I he ar that c l o th ing ' s co l or affect + the people who put on the c l o th es .
F or ex amp le , a man who put s on a re d ti e ten d s to become a more a g re s s ive man , but a man who put s on a b l u e one ten d s to become a more re la x ed man .
Some girl s say that they feel c al m and woman ish when they we ar J a p an e se tra d i tion al c l o th es .
B y the way , I must a d m it that a l ot of work er s can not de c id e what to we ar .
P o l ic e , do c t or s , and for ce s must we ar certain c l o th es .
This may be e v id ence of no re l ation between c l o th es and character s .
In conc l us ion , c l o th es have certain in f l u ence to people ' s character .
P e op le ch o o se their c l o th es by their character .
I started G o l f ing ! !
I ' m going to go go l f ing next month .
It will be the th ir d time I have ever go ne to a go l f course .
A l th ough I got an old go l f c l u b set from my friend , there are some pro ble m s with play ing in Tokyo .
G o l f course s are usual ly quite far from the c ent er of the c ity .
And play ing is ex p en s ive , too . ( more than 1 5 0 0 0 yen ) . .
I of ten go out to co f f e es h op s .
U s u ally , I go to T ul ly ' s co f f e es h op s and
my favor ite co f f e e is always `` To day ' s C o f f e e `` .
O f course , I have a c up of de l ic i ous co f f e e when I go to there ,
but my re al reason for going is not only to d r in k co f f e e .
R a ther , I go to there to study English and read b ook s .
I am able to ma in tain better conc ent r ation there than at m y home .
I want to im p ro ve my English
because I want to talk with people from for e i g n co un t ri es .
I want go to over se as some time .
I ' m sit ting the T O E I C ex a m next S un day .
I ' ve been p re p ar ing for it for month s ,
I think it ' s im p or t ant for me to sp en d as much time and en er g y as possible study ing for the ex a m , but it ' s also c r u c i al to keep in sha pe .
One more thing , I have ha y f ever , so I ' ve got to try not to s ne e z e
We are very l u c k y it did n t ra in yesterday .
A bout 36 th ous and s run n er ra n around c ent r al Tokyo .
The course , or g an i z ing , volunteer ing and w ar m c he er ing were all ex ce ll ent .
To day , my friend and I went to play ma h j on g .
It was the first time I went to his home .
To my surprise when I came to his house , it was very c le an .
like no body living there ! ! ! his p ar ent s go es to work .
I los t my money , my friend said that I am st up id .
To get re ve ng e , I at e his two b an an as .
so I am ha p p y .
P le a se tell me how this would be in J a p an e se :
`` H a p p y b ir th day de ar M o ther `` or something e qu i v al ent to this p h r a se .
I can read only Ka ta k an a and H ir a g an a so if please write some p h r a se with k an j i . .
P le a se also a tra n s c ri p tion = )
It has been about one year since I took my co ll e g e entrance ex a m in ation .
My teacher told us that we would have a l ot of free time after the ex a m , But I ' m still bu s y .
I still have many things to do .
Some things I like but some things I do n ' t like .
I must write new s st or ies every week and le ar n K or e an .
I feel tired but pro d u c t ive .
To day is T h an k s g i v ing day , and I am at my friend ' s house .
I at e , s l ept , and watch ed T V .
I ' ve take n a n a p at least 7 hour s in the last 4 days , and I eat my f i ll every day .
C h ri st m as is draw ing near , and I watch ed l ot s of a d ver t is e ment s on T V .
S . , and I not ic ed that people ce le b r ate such even t s gr and ly comp ar ing with my country , J a p an .
This is one of the reason s why I feel co m f or t able in the U .
I wish to study in a E ur o pe an country .
A re there free course s in English which train in the hu man it ies in your country ?
T h an k s so much !
It ' s difficult to p r a c t ic e writing if you do n ' t know what to write about .
D o you have some idea s or do you know a we b s ite where I can get idea s for some good to p ic s ?
There I im p ro ve my speak ing and listen ing s k i ll s while enjoy ing con ver s ation with n at ive speak er s .
To day I went to such a c a f e on the way back from job again .
As long as time and money all ow s , I ' m going to see k that kind of c a f e and find new world .
J ust look ing ! !
So , we went around the ma ll .
But there is not one that she want ed .
So , we did n ' t bu y anything , just w in d ow s h op p ed .
It took one hour for us to get there .
And we will have to go to the another sh op which is near my house .
I walk ed around the large p ar k near my a p ar t ment for about an hour , because I re ally need ed the ex er c is e .
Even though it was dark near the ro ad , a f e w people were j o g g ing .
I was en v i ous as they seemed so he al th y .
A fter le aving from the p ar k , I went to bu y some f o o d and dr in k for my dinner .
I got them at a re c ent ly open ed s up er m ar ke t .
It ' s a quiet st or e , and the p ri ce s are l ow .
We are a gr o up in a co m m un ity who have the same t ar g e t . . .
O k , I will start with the l ad ies . . .
There ' re 6 l ad ies in my co m m un ity includ e ing me . . .
The ma j or ity of the l ad ies m ad e me think that l ad ies in this present day do n ' t want to be just a house w if e . . .
They want to have a care er too . . .
They are work ing for the go ver n ment as c i v il s er v ant s . . .
1 is in the to ur is m se c t or and the re st , I do n ' t know . . .
I think as long as time go es on , we can be close r and I will as k her then . . .
The re st of the l ad ies are job less . . .
No t re ally job less , we just do n ' t do anything for in c o m ing money . . .
1 is just wait ing for her m aster class start . .
And the re st are job - see k er s . . .
And that make s me the you ng est in my class . .
The other one is work ing in one of f ly ing comp an ies . . .
And the re st , I have n ' t got ten more i nformation from him yet . . .
I ' m not an easy - going girl since I do n ' t know all of them . . .
I just started to be friend s with some . . .
B e ing friend s with a l ot of people is re ally interest ing . . .
If I can w a ke up e ar ly tomorrow morning . . .
I want to make l un ch .
I am look ing for an e f f ic i ent way of le ar n ing for e i g n language s .
What do you think about R o se t ta S t on e , the so f t w ar e for le ar n ing a for e i g n language ?
I went to catch s qu ir re l s last S un day . The ra in made the hi ll s id es became a little we t , so we should watch our s te p and tri ed not to f a ll down .
I took a re s er v ation in the be st re st a ur ant in R op po ng i : ) C a n ' t wait !
I ar ri v ed at home . I came home .
My friend s are also w or ri ed about their future .
I ho pe that all of us will be fine .
I w or e w ar m l o th es because that day was very co l d .
But my hand s were as co l d as ic e !
It ra in ed , so we had to cha t in a re st a ur ant most of the day .
We almost did not ri d e the at t r a ction s .
B e c a us e we at e a l ot of great f o o d which I want ed to try before .
There is l ot s of good f o o d at Tokyo D is ne y R es or t !
I s the f o o d good at other D is ne y l and l o c ation s ?
I ' d like to keep a so r t of di ar y here . I think it would be a great ch ance to im p ro ve my English .
In fact , it ' s re ally poor : - (
My name is And re a and I ' m an It al i an guy living near V ic en z a , in no r ther n I ta ly .

My w if e went to her f i el d for p ic k ing ve g e t able s yesterday .
My w if e came back home at five .
We all went to a s um m er f est i v al he l d in M u k a i g a h ar a which was he l d at a n ur se ry school near my house .
My mother - in - law came to our home at se ve n and stay ed over night .

E ver y year my mother give s me an a d v ent c al en d ar even though I ' m 2 8 year s old now .
One week a g o , me and my mother went sh op p ing to g e ther
But I found an a d v ent c al en d er that I had n ' t see n before .
It was big and looked like it had n ic e ch o c o l ate s inside .
I read what it had inside .
my mother came to me and she said `` o h do you want that now `` .
I thought you were an a d ul t .
To day I open ed the 1 st .
It had a big y um m y ch o c o l ate inside just as I thought .
The day before yesterday , the re s ul t s of the 1 5 3 th T O E I C t est was an no un c ed on the in ter ne t !

I A t ten d ed a L e c ture
To day , I at ten d ed a le c ture meeting about the teaching of English as an in ter n ation al language .
A p rofessor from the U n ive r s ity of L on d on came to my un ive r s ity as a speak er and le c ture d us in English .
As you may know , my ma j or is far from teaching English .
The reason why I at ten d ed the le c ture was to see how English speak er s made present ation s in a for m al sit u ation and how the a ud i ence asked question s in English .
I le ar n ed so much from the le c ture !
F or ex amp le , I understood that students who asked question s need ed to tell the le c ture r their name and a f f il i ation before as k ing question s .
My te ch n ical present ation class teacher a d v is ed me to at ten d as many le c ture meeting s or con f er ence s as possible before ma k ing my present ation .
I want to at ten d many le c ture s and con f er ence s !
I came back to L an g - 8 to day , and now I will re st ar t my English study .
Let ' s c he er up ! !
I have my w is d o m te e th .
I had two of them p ul led out one year a g o but I still have two on the / my left side .
I ' m free at T h ur s day but I think the d ent is t I came to see last s time take s T h ur s day s off .
P ul ling out take s two day , because the d ent is t has to c he c k the place where the de c a y ed too th was after it is p ul led out .
R e c ent ly , I have had a lack of sleep because of work .
I ' m very sleep y .
H a ve been mi x ing re al ity and dr e a m s a little .
W h i ch is a little b it da ng er ous .
but I have made an interest ing dis c o ver y .
it will be to find a new one . ?
When your feel ing d u ll and sleep y , you become less conc er n ed about the small stuff .
I enjoy read ing ma g a z in es .
I l o ve read ing business and te ch no l o g y ma g a z in es every month .
My bo s s or d er s the se ma g a z in es for e m p l o y e es and we can read the se ma g a z in e
I can le ar n about new te ch no l o g y from the se ma g a z in es .
To day ' s j o ur n al ent ry is about what I ' m afraid of .
The hi n t s to the answer are l is ted be l ow ,
1 ) It is usual ly at home .
2 ) It has t re m en d ous p ow er .
5 ) It is good at big and d y n a m ic trick s like p un ch ing , k ic k ing , s la p p ing . . .
If you know the answer , please commen t .
It has been dr i z z ling all day here .
The dr i z z le re m in d s me of the de w on the tea - leave s in my home t ow n , which make s me think of the gr e en tea from my home t ow n .
G re en tea is my favor ite kind of tea . I es pe c i ally l o ve to s n if f it while it ' s in the c up . I have fond me m or ies about this tea .
E ver y sp r ing , my m um took my el d er s is ter and I to the tea f i el d s to p ic k tea leave s .
When my m un and my s is ter were bu s y p ic k ing the tea leave s , I like d to find b ir d s n est s in the tree s .
No w , when I am tired , I make myself a c up of gr e en tea .
I l o ve gr e en tea .
How about a dr in k ?
I s l ept for over 1 2 hour s to day .
I can not re m e m b er the last time I had to sleep so long .
A fter I w o ke up , I went to a T ha i re st a ur ant where a my friend works .
I had a To m k a g a i , and a P ad ( ? ) th a i there .
Even though I do not like j un k f o o d , it is c he a p and easy to bu y .
So , I ten d to eat them more of ten .
A n y way , I just want ed say that I had s l ept well and at e a de l ic i ous me al .
It ' s been a long time since I qu it my job .
That mean s I have not us ed English for a long time .
But , is that the ex c us e ? ?
One of my friend s began to study English and he in t ro d u c ed this we b s ite to me .
I s it a long dr e a m of me ? ?
The J a p an e se T e a C er e m on y
To tell you the tru th , I do n ' t know anything about the J a p an e se tea ce re m on y because I ' ve never le ar n ed about it .
S in ce I was you ng er , I have n ' t like d both the tea ce re m on y or the J a p an e se f l ow er ar r an g e ment because I do n ' t like we ar ing k im on o .
R i g h t now I re g re t it because I c a n ' t explain anything about them .
I knew that when we had the tea ce re m on y , both of my friend s were very n er v ous .
A ll I could say was follow what other people is do ing .
It has a long history .
It was a ha b it for them .
To day , our p l an was we ar ing J a p an e se ar m or s , but it did n ' t work .
O f course , we can see a very l o ve ly J a p an e se ga r d en .
There are some v ic t im s who s u f f er from po ll u tion .
They work ed in some A m er ic an , J a p an e se or other in ter n ation al comp an ies .
The se fact or ies are not conc er n ed about the en v ir on ment .
They re le a se was te water without proper pro ce s s ing .
That ' s why people get i ll .
M e x ic o ' s go ver n ment est a b l ish ed very str ic t law s to pro te c t la b or s and e c o .
The la b or s in M e x ic o do n ' t get proper s al ar ies .
They works in very ter ri ble place s .
The fact or ies b ri b e M e x ic i an a u th or it ies .
When C h in a has c he a p er co st s for la b or s , fact or ies mo ve there .
What they left in M e x ic o is po ll u tion and dis c ar d ed fact or ies .
The c or r up t a u th or it ies make people s u f f er and to r ture d .
I ho pe the sit u ation will change so bad ly .
S in ce I have take n English class es from j un i or high school to un ive r s ity , f in ally I have my own opinion .
I am a person who c a n ' t speak and listen to English well either .
Even though in my opinion , my English is better than or d in ar y J a p an e se people , it ' s still a little b it . . . . .
: ( A n y way , I ' m still un s k il led at English .
Why J a p an e se c a n ' t speak and listen to English well ?
F ir st reason is that J a p an is kind of is o la ted .
I mean , no country b or d er s direct ly with J a p an .
But when we pass over the b or d er s , we have to cross the sea .
So act u ally , J a p an has f e w er for e i g n people than other co un t ri es , which b or d er with other s .
I hard ly ever come a cross people who us e English as their n at ive language ( for ex amp le A m er ic an s , English people ) when I ha ng around a street .
So J a p an e se people do n ' t of ten have an op p or t un ity to run a cross them and co m m un ic ate with them .
We do n ' t of ten have the ch ance to be st im ul at ed by for e i g n er s either .
The second reason is that way s of teaching English in J a p an are a little wrong .
: ( In most J a p an e se English class es , we do n ' t need to listen to English very much , let alone talk in English with class m ate s .
If you are n ' t called on in class , you w o n ' t speak any w or d s ex c ept for cha t ting with your friend .
The ly ri c s of a new so ng
The se are going to be the ly ri c s of my new so ng .
It ' s a re ally short so ng and was in s p ir ed by my friend ' s idea .
B e c a us e I was able to tell my students my thought s and feel ing s .
I spoke to them from my heart !
No t think ing , just feel .
I do n ' t have a good w or d to explain it .
I got off at U en o S t ation to eat my favor ite R ame n , I ch ir an , but the sh op was close d .
My girl f ri en d asked me to have dinner with her , but I could n ' t make it because I had a l ot of work to do to day .
I w or e a new business s u it , but it ra in ed when I went home .
I l o ve language s , in particular , the sound of English .
It feel s like the beautiful f l ow of water to me .
But some time s I want to th r ow everything away .
I just en v y people who are s m ar t .
U m m , sorry , I ' m ne g at ive to day , is n ' t it ?
To day , I return ed home l ate .
It is 1 : 3 0 a m and I ' ll w a ke up at 7 a m tomorrow morning .
I felt that I need to im p ro ve English for listen ing and speak ing .
The ch er ry b l o s s o m s have come out la ter than usual .
No w ch er ry tree s are in b l o o m in J a p an .
he ll o every on e .
This is the first time that I have come here .
I would like to im p ro ve my English day by day , and also wish that every on e who read this paper has a very n ic e day .
On this day all the people see m ha p p y and ex cited .
On this day all the school s , b an k s , go ver n ment office s and many other st or es close to ce le b r ate .
A l ot of f a m il ies in C an ad a go out d o or p ic n ic s in the p ar k and invite their friend s to have a good time .
they do b ar b e c u e , dance and many f un things .
P e op le con g re g ate in a particular place with their f a m il ies to watch the f i re w or k s .
P e op le enjoy see ing the co l or ful and strong sound .
On C an ad a day all the people have the day off and they go outside to ce le b r ate .
I think the be st day in C an ad a is C an ad a day because you see all the people we ar the co l or re d and be ha p p y .
Yes ter day , I f in ally finish ed my ex a m which last ed for two week s .
It was re ally a t ough time since I do n ' t like the sub j e c t that I am study ing .
I am study ing business which is not my first ch o ic e .
O ri g in ally , I thought that it was great for me to study in this f i el d .
But after the se s ever al month s of study , I think I am not a person who is ke en on study ing business .
L u c k i ly , I finish ed my ex a m already , and I can ce le b r ate C h ri st m as who le he ar ted ly
J a p an ' s n ation al so c c er tea m became ch amp ion in the As i an C up ! ! ! ! ! !
I think you should de c id e to keep the ma in ten ance time on a re g ul ar b as is , because a l ot of people have sign ed up to this sit e l ate ly and you will have to keep the con f i g ur ation simple and clear all the time .
Let ' s say , once a month , may b e on a M on day for three hour s , would be con ve n i ent for every on e .
I do n ' t re c o m m en d it on S at ur day , the high time for us er s from the view po in t of c ust ome r s er v ic e .
T a ke care of your s el f and than k s always for your great job .
I am p r a c t ic ing listen ing to English .
I still do n ' t understand the di f f er ence between `` l `` and `` r `` .
My so n is in the first gra d e of j un i or high school .
He has n ' t finish his s um m er home w or k even though school start s tomorrow ! H is J un i or high give s the students l o ad s of home w or k .
So I told him that he should work on it little by little every day from the begin n ing .
D es p ite my a d v ic e , he pro c r a st in at ed unti l to day . . .
He is draw ing a picture of a G un d a m for his ar t home w or k now . . .
O f course , he w o n ' t be able to p re p ar e for the t est on the first day after the ho l i day . . .
T ir ing D a y .
I came home in the morning hour s because of my b ir th day part y last night ( ? ) .
I sp en d some time with my bo y f ri en d .
He and I at e the b ro il ed small in t est in es of c at t le .
And then we cha t ted in my c ar .
Yes ter day , I was con f us ed about what c ri t ical think ing is because of the commen t : `` a lack in c ri t ical think ing in J a p an e se education . ``
Q u ot ing W i k i p ed i a , `` C ri t ical think ing con s is t s of ment al pro ce s se s of dis c er n ment , an a ly s is and e v al u ation . ``
In short , in my opinion , c ri t ical think ing mean s think ing and an a ly z ing by myself , in or d er to de c id e what I want to or should do when f a c ing b ur n ing question s .
However , in J a p an , people still think that normal ly it is polite to try and for m a con s en s us without str u g g ling against some on e else because J a p an is ha r m on y - or i ent ed so c i e ty .
T h us , J a p an e se people , includ ing me , may be poor at c ri t ical think ing .
We ten d to comp ly o b se s s ive ly with J a p an e se c ust o m s .
T h an k s to this a w ar e ness , I made up my mind to try to put `` c ri t ical think ing `` into p r a c t ic e .
I found this good we b s ite and I thought it can help me le ar n e ng l ish better .
A c t u ally , I ' m not good at English and I ' m afraid of speak ing in it / English . . .
D ur ing my w in ter va c ation , I ' m study ing English and w ri t ting a comp o s i tion ( one ) / comp o s i tion s ( more than one ) every day .
B y the way , I ' m also interest ed in S p an ish . If you want to le ar n C h in e se , I can help : )

I have an al ar m clock that I b ough t last year .
The old clock is an at o m ic clock , but some time it show s the wrong time .
When it mi s se s the w a ve s , some time s it show s the time sign if ic ant ly wrong .
The clock is n ' t an at o m ic clock and it does n ' t make a ti c to c sound .
It s de s i g n is very good .
Let me in t ro d u ce myself .
My name is J in .
I am 2 6 year s old .
I mo v ed from K or e a to L o s A ng el es , C al if or n i a 3 year s a g o .
I want ed to le ar n English and he al th care .
So I started to study them .
I was better than before but I felt that my language s k i ll s are not good enough yet .
A n y way , it does n ' t matter because I ` m going to try to le ar n them every time .
A n y body , ' give ' me some i nformation how to im p ro ve English s k i ll s f aster .
It take s me more than 2 0 hour s to get there from my are a .
It take s me 9 hour s to get to M o s h i from D ar .
When we got to the S e le ng e t i c amp sit e , it was 6 o ' clock .
No w , I am work ing for the J a p an e se de p ar t ment in my office .
O ur desk s are next to the A m er ic an de p ar t ment .
I always listen to their English con ver s ation s , but I still c a n ' t full y understand ( w h ite and black people ' s English are very difficult to understand for st up id J a p an e se ) l o l .
Some time s I o b s er ve other de p ar t ment s d ur ing at work .
And one of the A m er ic an work er s was having his b ir th day at that time .
They started tak ing p h ot o s of each other .
O h , if it ' s possible , I want to be b or n in E ur o pe or A m er ic a in my next life .
When I live d with my family , I had a ri ch b re a k f a st because my mother c ook ed for us .
My mother and s is ter usual ly had b re ad and co f f e e , but my father and I prefer r ed ri ce and mi s o so up .
A t that time , I did n ' t re al i z e that my mother had to work hard e ar ly in the morning to c ook va ri ous f o o d s for us .
I re ally a p p re c i ate my mother .
When I started living by myself I did n ' t want to sp en d a long time ma k ing b re a k f a st , so I had some f r u it , so y mi l k , and ce re al or b re ad .
It only took 5 minute s to p re p ar e .
Some time s , I mi s s having b re a k f a st with my family .

she just heard about some on e saying bad things about her be st friend , and she told it to her friend .
her be st friend got a ng ry when she heard it , so she and
the person who s m e ar ed her had a fight .

I want to re conc i le them .
I study English every day because I want to work in a for e i g n country .
But it ' s difficult to do it in my comp an y , because my comp an y has no bra n ch es in for e i g n co un t ri es . . .
I like my job in my comp an y , and my bo s s prais es me .
But . . . since I am work ing at this comp an y , I do n ' t think that I will be able to go a b ro ad on business .
So I p l an to change comp an y , but I am he s it ant .

There is a very ver n al f r a g r ance here in S en d a i where I ' m living , to day .
We have been feel ing s c ar ed re c ent ly because of the e ar th qu a ke , but the f r a g r ance would w ar m up our heart s a little .
I re ally ho pe that I can have `` O h an a m i `` and enjoy eat ing and dr in k ing to g e ther with my friend s , when the ch er ry b l o s s o m s re a ch full b l o o m in this c ity .
F or ex amp le , we ex change present s with each other , dr in k , and eat c a ke on C h ri st m as day and the ch il d re n believe in S ant a C la us .
J a p an e se people are very good at im p or ting other c ul ture s .
A l m o st all of J a p an e se enjoy C h ri st m as but J a p an e se C h ri st i an s make up only 1 . 2 % of the p op ul ation .
M or e o ver the J a p an e se C h ri st m as has no re l ation to re l i g ion .
It s re l i g i ous mean ing was los t d ur ing it s im p or t into J a p an .
Why J a p an e se people have been im p or ting C h ri st m as , is because J a p an e se people are fond of We s ter n c ul ture s .
F or this f e w s year s we have been im p or ting H a ll ow e en .
I finish ed pack ing for T a i w an .
is 5 : 3 0 A M , but the c or re c t time is 4 : 3 0 A M ( not 5 : 3 0 A M ) .
It is difficult for me to f a ll as le e pe ar ly on th e day before the tri p
It does not a ch e all the time , but I feel so re when I eat something hot .
It seemed to be get ting better , but I a c c id ent ally b it the so re part and made it w or se .

I went sh op p ing yesterday and b ough t some stuff like b a c on and eggs .
I did n ' t want to pay for it , so I re f us ed it .
A fter sh op p ing , I tri ed to go back home .
I saw a bu s coming and I de c id ed to run .
As you gue s s , the eggs were b ro k en inside my r u c k s a c k .
When I open ed my b a g and saw l i qu id eggs all over the place
No w , the e g g dr i ed in my b a g , it look s like se m en .
It would be a sh ame if some on e saw it and thought that it was se m en .
To be clear , I have never had se m en in my r u c k s a c k before .
I listen to r ock ' n ' ro ll and dance m us ic in the morning .
This is because I want to listen to r h y th m ical m us ic in the morning .

I know they were n it p ic k ing at the P re s id ent , and it seemed to be ch il d ish .
They should know the pro ver b : When in R ome , do as R o man s do . . .

To day I p r a c t ic ed a c ar d trick .

I be t with the office people .
As a re s ul t I los t be t ting .
I b ough t co f f e e , p at b ing s u , and p i z z a .
So I am s ad ; - (
My old er brother is S in .
He made b a ll o on an im al s .
He always works hard .
He is my ro le mo d el .
I show ed a c ar d trick in English class .
But I made a mistake do ing the c ar d trick .
I was s ad .
But one more time .
I had success .
To day is S at ur day and so I have no school .
I was read ing b ook s all day .
I read `` The S ha d ow O ver In n s m o u th `` .
I re m e m b er , I had night m ar es as a kid after read ing this b ook .
My first day with a for e i g n friend on the in ter ne t
It is quite ex c it ing for me to make con ta c t with for e i g n er s .
I have always dr e a m t of ma k ing friend s around the world .
To day , I took my first s te p .
I know a J a p an e se us er on la ng - 8 .
T h an k s to g l o b al i z ation , a T a i w an e se person and a J a p an e se person can cha t in English , we are able to co m m un ic ate on the in ter ne t even though our mother to n gue s are different .
He st ud i ed in A ust r al i a , his English is pretty good .
B e ing afraid of off en se , I was very n er v ous at first .
However , his friend ly gr e e ting re ally help ed to re l i e ve my n er v ous ness .
It is , I think , a good start .
I ho pe to make more for e i g n friend s .
I ' ll go to see a `` B l u e man `` show in Tokyo J a p an on S at ur day .
A fter the show , I ' ll have dinner with my co ll e a gue s at a hotel .
U s u ally I dr in k S a ke or al c o h o l at dinner .
However , this time I re f r a in from dr in k ing it ,
because no body dr in k s it ex c ept me .
What do you think ?
S e e you la ter
Some time s , I am able to he ar other people ' s voice s .
One day , I te le p h on ed my friend , when I hung up the te le p h on e , I heard something .
It was my friend ' s voice .
What a strange ex pe ri ence .
Then , I te le p h on ed my friend again and asked her if she said that , to my surprise , I was right .
My favor ite a u th or is D an B r ow n ; he is g en i us .
U n f or t un ate ly , I have only read two of his no ve l s .
They are The D a v in c i C o d e and The L o st S y m b o l .
I like The L o st S y m b o l more than The D a v in c i C o d e .
While I was read ing , many things surprise d me .
The L o st S y m b o l is the be st no ve l I ' ve ever read , and I suggest every on e read it .
W as ting time
I will probab ly go sh op p ing or sleep .
D o you know where S h i man e p re f e c ture is ?
It is in we st J a p an , at the near est place to So u th K or e a .
I live d in I w a m i from 2 0 0 1 to 2 0 0 3 for business purpose s .
I had many ex pe ri ence s , ha p p y one s and un ha p p y one s .
It made me gr ow up .
She is a person who s up p or ted me .
L ook ing back on my past ent ri es , I ' m pretty surprise d how ho r ri ble my English was , and at the same time , ha p p y to see im p ro ve ment s in myself .
I ' m not a co ll e g e st ud ent , ( but I ' m ) work ing hard every day and some time s us ing English .
The be l ow is my de s c ri p tion that I made for this pro d u c t but it would be a w es ome if you could c or re c t the way so that it sound s more natural and may b e hu m or ous .

I have sp ent so much money ever since I started sh ar ing it e m s here at F l ut ter S c a pe . H a ha ha Tokyo is a w es ome !
I had two reason s for r ent this D V D .
I re c o m m en d this mo v i e .
C o m po s i tion 0 7 2 0 , please help me c or re c t it or provide me with some idea s . T h an k s ! !
It is of ten not a good thing to mo ve to a new c ity or a new country because of the los s of old friend s .
A number of people ma in tain that it is dis ad v ant age ous to mo ve to a new c ity or a new country d u e to the los s of old friend s .
While some people ' s first re a ction may be to agree with this state ment , there are comp el ling reason s to ex p l or e it in more de p th .
As I see it , mo v ing to a new c ity make s me str e ng th en my friend s h i p s and b ro ad en my ho ri z on .
F ir st and for e m o st , mo v ing to a new c ity make s me own op p or t un it ies to show my old friend s how m ul t ic ul t ur al and va ri ous the new c ity is .
T a ke my own ex pe ri ence , for ex amp le .
B e c a us e of living in a new c ity , I was able to invite my friend s to visit an interest ing c ity .
I had ch ance s to become a to ur g u id e to show them around my new c ity , T a i pe i .
T a k ing them to beautiful place s they did not have ch ance s to visit before would str e ng th en our friend s h i p and all ow them to have a good time .
With o ut mo v ing to a new c ity , I would not have had op p or t un it ies to sha re in no v at ive things with them .
There f or e , it was be ne f ic i al for me to mo ve to a new c ity .
M or e o ver , I would be ne f it from living in a c ity which I have never go ne to before .
I b ro ad en ed my ho ri z on in a new en v ir on ment .
I made a number of new friend s who have different c ul ture s and back g r ound s .
I was also able to go to the m us e um s or ex h i b i tion s to im p ro ve my understand ing of the c ust o m s , c ul ture , and history of the new c ity , which re f in ed my ta s te for ar t .
In addition , I could go to the un ive r s ity by M R T rather than b ic y c le since there is a con ve n i ent public tra n s p or t ation s y s te m in T a i pe i .
On the con t r ar y , if I had not go ne to a new place , I would have no idea about what a de ve l op ed c ity it is .
C on se qu ent ly , living in a new c ity open s my eyes and c re ate s more op p or t un it ies for me .
In conc l us ion , not only did mo v ing to a new c ity str e ng th en my friend s h i p , but it also help ed me get to know this world .
There are a number of a d v ant age s for me to put myself in new circumstance s .
However , I feel con f id ent that the reason s I have me n tion ed a b o ve are strong er .
I have p u b l ish ed a number of very short j o ur n al s on T w it ter .
If you follow my we b p age on T w it ter , you can understand what I ' m writing about .
D o n ' t look back , ever .
L if e is short .
A person ' s life will end .
E ver y body know s that .
The he d g e h o g is a kind of an im al with th or n y s ur f a ce and a tender in ter n al .
The two le ad character in this b ook are both fond of so l it ar i ness , re f u g e from other s and themselves like the he d g e h o g s .
T h r ough a ne c d ot es , the a u th or in f er s some question s w or th y of think ing from a co m m on place life .
It ' s a b ook about p h il o s op h y
I did not understand it the first time I read it
But after the second time , I just understood what the a u th or mean t
In such a so c i e ty where every on e is like a he d g e h o g , and how do we keep gentle ?
U n d er the c ul t ur al di f f er ence and id ent if ic ation , the ma in character p ur s u es the mean ing of her ex is t ence all the time .

U se of C l ut ch
I have a question conc er n ing the us e of `` c l ut ch `` .
When I watch a b a se b a ll game in ma j or le a gue b a se b a ll ,
I of ten he ar `` a c l ut ch hi t ter `` or `` a c l ut ch p it ch er `` .
In this con te x t , the w or d , `` c l ut ch `` f un ction s as an a d j e c t ive in or d er to de s c ri b e

`` If I qu it the job , w o n ' t you mi s s me ? ``
I ga z ed at him for f e w second s with a s us p ic i ous look .
He looked e m b ar r as s ed and had a sh y smile d on his face . `` . . .
But I ' ll for g e t what I said to day because I ' m st up id , `` he con t in u ed . .
When I got on the train and found a sea t , tea r s were run n ing down my face .
`` You told me you w o n ' t mi s s me even if I leave ?
I believe d what you said comp le te ly at that time . . . `` I thought to myself .
I always want his w or d s but he ' s not good at express ing ( ver b al i z ing ) his thought s .
It le ad s to f re qu ent mi s un d er st and ing s though . When small things that I not ic e every s ing le day comp i le my heart , they turn out my hu m ble wish es . ( ? )
I felt like I was e m p ty inside .
I saw the mo v i e ' L if e I s B e a ut i ful ' .
I will never for g e t it d ur ing my who le life .
The mo v i e is about the per i o d when the J e w s were s l aught er ed .
A J e w ish man me e t s a pretty woman and they f a ll in l o ve with each other .

But he di es .
I think he is a good father to his so n .
They were in the w or st sit u ation and he still tri ed to be c he er ful for his so n .
My sit u ation is not the w or st .
So I will try to be a b ri g h t person .

When I go back to C h in a , I ' ll try to write about my stay in F i j i . . .

But I had to go to work to day . When I went to work , it made it w or se because no body answered my me s s age : (
To day , I had an English class called `` H o l is t ic English `` .
He is funny and pretty know led g e able .
I took out my con ta c t l en se s bo x and sat it on my desk .
He p ic k ed it up and asked me what it was .
I did n ' t know how to say `` con ta c t l en se s `` because I even did n ' t know this w or d .
I went on a tri p to T ha il and with my family for the re c ent four days .

It only has b as ic in st r u ment s like a p i an o , b as s , g u it ar , and dr um s , it ' s very simple , but we need nothing more , the b and is just per f e c t .
She is not only t al ent ed , but also so beautiful and se x y that I would sleep with her if she want ed to ( may b e not ) .
A n ex p er t said , `` When you say ne g at ive w or d s to your s el f , your bra in has only ne g at ive im age s .
My hu s b and and I go gr o ce ry sh op p ing every week en d .
( there ) were C h ri st m as sh op p er s who was r us h ing to ( do ? ) their C h ri st m as sh op p ing .
It ' s kind a de p re s s ing to im a g in e ma s s ive tra f f ic j a m s on this up c o m ing week en d .
So I p l an n ed out the dis he s and game s for the part y and we also p re p ar ed the p ri z es for the game s !
That ' s one of my favor ite re st a ur ant s .
This time , I or d er ed : 6 o z Sir l o in s te a k and C a es ar s al ad and b a k ed sweet p ot at o with ho ne y s y r up and mar s h m a ll ow s .
My hu s b and or d er ed ( a O R the ) big b r ow n i e for de s er t .
I even felt like ( I could he ar my heart ra c ing ) because of this high - s u g ar sweet s ( I im a g in e . ) A n y way , That was a l o ve ly night .

The s n ow is like ly to stop f al ling soon and begin n ing to set t le .
The gr ound of the who le world is co ver ed with w h ite s n ow right now .
When I was a ch il d , I sp ent s ever al year s in a mo un tain ous re g ion .
In those days , I wonder ed why such beautiful p ur e w h ite f la ke s f e ll from the s k y and me l ted away from the gr ound .
S n ow f la ke s are the m aster p i e ce s which nature c re ate s .
F or my morning p r a c t ic e , I ' ve been listen ing to N P R .
A t first , I was co m f or ted by the girl ' s * me ow * .
M a y b e I ' m get ting too old ( ? ) .
I think that on the sp or t s day we should a b o l ish even t s that en c o ur age students to de f e at other s .
I ` ve been feel ing bad for the past 3 0 minute s .
L a st week my friend got mar ri ed and I ho st ed his po st w ed d ing part y .
We play ed a mo v i e of the his t or ies of both the b ri d e and the b ri d e g ro o m and a mo v i e that con tain ed the me s s age from the b ri d e ' s family .
Some un e x pe c ted incident s o c c ur r ed but we made it ! !
It was so bu s y but yet it was as l o a very ha p p y day ! !
N I C E T O M E E T Y O U
This is my first di ar y .
I ho pe to see more of L an g - 8 .
I am good in J a p an e se O ta ku C ul ture , for ex amp le , M an g a , A n im e and n ic on ic o d o u g a .
I E s pe c i ally like ' D r a g a on B a ll ' .
D r a g on B a ll is a very interest ing A n im e .
But I have not watch ed the re c ent D r a g on B a ll mo v i e yet .
If I get enough time I ' ll watch it .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to watch ing it ! ! ! !
We l c ome back , ro b in s !
My hu s b and and I had just had a talk about b ir d n est s yesterday .
We have an a p p le tree in our back y ar d in which a pai r of A m er ic an ro b in s n est ed and la id eggs the year before last .
We were look ing for w ar d to see ing the pai r ra is ing a b ro o d .
But un f or t un ate ly their eggs did n ' t ha t ch , and they a b and on ed the n est .
A n un h at ch ed b l u e e g g was left behind in the n est , and one was c r a c k ed on the gr ound .
L a st year , no b ir d n est ed in the tree .
M a y b e my hu s b and had c ut back the bra n ch es so short that they were not s u it able to make a n est in .
I look at the n est from the side w al k so that I do n ' t s c ar e the n est - own er s .
I ho pe that I can he ar the ch ir p ing of her b ro o d from the n est .
And , I some time s get er r or s which is line in the display .
I have already been us ing it for 3 year s .
I ' m still think ing whether I should bu y a new one or not .
If I bu y it , I want a came r a which can take a good sh ot in a dark place .
T er ri ble C o l d
I c aught a bad co l d last week .
A t first , my no se was run n y and I could not stop s ne e z ing .
Then one night , my no se was to t ally stuff ed up and I could not b re a th at all !
I could not sleep .
No w I am di z z y and I can not he ar well .
When people talk to me , the voice s sound like they are coming from 3 0 mi le s away .
It feel s like a piece of paper is co ver ing my e ar .
I am so sick right now .
I ha te having a co l d .
My no se is still stuff ed up as I ty pe the se w or d s .
I wish I get better soon .
I have los t my interest to write an ent ry .
So , I ' m only do ing c or re ction s for the time being .
I just stay at home and do some home w or k on house de c or ation . ( I p l an on do ing some house de c or ation in O c t o b er . )
When I a c c id ent ly found this place , I said W ow .
To day I have l ot s of work to do . I have to p re p ar e a re p or t for my bo s s and also do some house de c or at ing .
I think it ' s time for me to go job hu n ting because do ing work on the week en d is n ' t re ally something I like to do .
I ' m p re p ar ing the in t ro d u ction for my B ri t ish history ter m paper .
but I am afraid that I have a l ot of mistake s . .
The H is t or y of E ng l and is very pro f ound and comp le x .
It comp ri se s a hu g e number of even t s and the person s , who in f l u ence d . them .
In each e po ch there were ke y moment s and interest ing f i g ur es about which it is possible to read v o l um es .
I consider that one of the most am b i g u ous f i g ur es of English history is the re p re s ent at ive of the T ud or d y n as ty , and d aught er of K ing He n ry V I I - M ar i a the F ir st or as she is also name d - B l o o d y M ar y .
This name is still sh ro ud ed by a set of se c re t s and le g en d s .
There are no mo n u ment s put in her home l and . P e op le as s o c i ate the per i o d of her re i g n with b l o o d y ma s s a c re s ; the day of her de a th - also the s im ul ta ne ous day of access ion to the th ro ne E l i z a b e th I - was mar k ed as a n ation al ho l i day .
We see the picture g l o o m y enough , but it has interest ed me in this his t or ic f i g ur e .
H aving read about the qu e en at a history less on , I have started to sea r ch for every possible i nformation about her . F or in st ance , I have read va ri ous b ook s and watch ed f il m s that are con ne c ted with her person al ity .
When I have looked in English se ri al `` T ud or s `` , about this great d y n as ty , I became as s ur ed that my ter m paper will be about M ar i a .
I want ed to le ar n more about this strange , f an at ical qu e en who has been do ome d to give a large qu ant ity of de a th to in no c ent people .
In my work I have tri ed to tra c k M ar i a ' s life from b ir th to de a th .
I have co ll e c ted every possible le g en d con ne c ted with her , and the fact s of her b i o g r a p h y , which pro ve that this person was his t or ical and not e w or th y .
In R o man s 8 : 8 it say s : `` So then they that are in the f le s h can not please G o d . `` We make de c is ion s every day .
I s it from my f le s h or J es us ' will ?
My face must look like the dark c l o ud s .
It ' s like when P e ter walk ed on the sea to J es us .
If I look around at the world and not f o c us on J es us , my f le s h will be act i v at ed .
However , our L or d is so good , He s a v ed P e ter before he s un k . ( V er y n ic e ! )
A d j ust s our at t it ud e .
G u id es us .
I have no idea what I should say .
I wish my English writing s k i ll s would get better
I ho pe when I writing the them e of E c on o m ic s & A c c o un ting , I do n ' t make the same mistake s or at least do n ' t have a l ot of mistake s . . . .
I ho pe to be a better girl
I ho pe I can have more go al s of my own .
I ho pe I can do ever e y th ing by myself and be a strong girl
can it come tru e ? ?
How hard am I try ing for the a b o ve ?
I need some on e to s up p or t me
I am los t , con f us ed about myself , my future . . .
Ka r a o ke part y to night !
S or ry , I c a n ' t write English well to night because I ' m dr un k and
We only have 2 hour s left in the E aster ho l i day . . .
I want to play pai n t b a ll next ho l i day . .
I was work ing hard for one week to p re p ar e my or al present ation .
F ir st of all , there was a l ot of work in p re p ar ing the da ta for the talk .
I finish ed my / the P ow er P o in t s l id es by mi d night yesterday .
I m look ing for some on e who is a `` n at ive `` English speak er and is le ar n ing J a p an e se .
any way leave me a commen t if ur interest ed ~
I ' m not good co l d we a ther . with
I do n ' t us e an um b re ll a every day ,
because my house is sit u at ed near the sea
and the w in d is very hard there .
I will need many um b re ll as .
No w , I live at a full y - f ur n ish ed gue st house .
But , I will mo ve to a new , big g er a p ar t ment in S ept e m b er , because my family will come to G er man y from J a p an in No ve m b er .
In ter est ing ly , when G er man s mo ve out , they b r ing all the things in their room , includ ing the k it ch en a p p l i ance s , light bu l b s and bath t u b .
So , my new a p ar t ment is just e m p ty !
I have to bu y everything myself .
This s y s te m is better for people to make their own room s , but is not good for tra n s i ent re s id ent s like us .
I wonder how much it will co st to bu y f ur n i ture , electronic e qu i p t ment , , , .
My friend s call s me H ar u .
I usual ly leave my house at ten th ity .
There is much It is going to ra in tomorrow .
To day I had an on line English speak ing train ing s es s ion at R ar e J o b , but there were some pro ble m s .
Some time s I could n ' t he ar the teacher ' s voice , and at one point the S k y pe con ne ction was in ter r up ted .
Some people had written about R ar e j o b ' s S k y pe con ne ction in their b l o g s .
One b l o g g er w ro te , `` I re m e m b er the teachers who have good in ter ne t con ne ction s , and see k them out each time . ``
I re al i z ed that that was good a d v ic e . I ' m going to do that too .
My class m ate s
I have two be st friend s in my class .
They make me ha p p y every time .
If that is the case , please tell me about your friend .
And sha ll we become friend s .
T h an k you for read ing . . .
My 1 4 month old so n
J ust after the b ir th , I did n ' t feel I was ha p p y with a b a b y because I could n ' t sleep at all .
But time was the c ur e .
language is one of the co re as pe c t s of comp e t i tion
I ' m tired of tra n s la ting from C h in e se to English , so I ' m writing this di ar y without tra n s la ting .
I know my English is very poor , but I re ally like le ar n ing it .
C ur r ent ly , g l o b al business es has been dr ive n large ly by comp e t i tion . In my opinion , language is one of the co re e le ment s of comp e t i tion , es pe c i ally English as it is very im p or t ant in both work and study .
I am 1 5 year s old in school le ve l F . 3 .
I live in the small c ity of M a c a u , which is one of the S A R s of C h in a .
A p ar t from English , I am also study ing J a p an e se because of J a p an e se an im e and m us ic .
But re c ent ly I f o c us ed on J a p an e se too much that s why I have ne g le c ted my English st ud ies .
So I de c id ed to re s um e my st ud ies by writing in my di ar y here .
I b l ame myself for study ing English for 1 0 year s without any im p ro ve ment to my stand ar d .
My ability to he ar in English is very poor and I have a limit ed v o c a b ul ar y .
O f course writing is one of my we a k ness es as well .
So I re ally ho pe I can im p ro ve my English on this sit e .
If I can at least first start with writing .
the day before yesterday I saw my c ous in we ar ing ha ir ex ten s ion s .
so I asked her about the ex ten s ion s .
`` How much did it co st ? ``
then she said `` only R p 4 . 0 0 0 . ``
' ' W ow ! That ' s so c he a p ! ! ``
I want to bu y ha ir ex ten s ion s too !
C an you help me to bu y some co l o ur ed ha ir ex ten s ion s ?
' ' o k a y , I will as k my friend first ' ' she re p l i ed
I want five of this co l o ur . . .
one set only co st s R p 4 . 0 0 0 . . .
that mean s 5 set s only co st R p 2 0 . 0 0 0
it ' s o k a y , that ' s not too . ex p en s ive .
she sen t me some me s s age s
saying that out of the co l o ur s that I want ed , only re d and p ur p le were a v a il able ( ? )
I ' ve be g un an in ter v i e w pro ce s s to day to he ar p ot ent i al us er ' s opinion s direct ly .
I ' m w or ri ed about whether there are people who want to me e t me to get i nformation about my a p p s .
I ga ve up p i an o when I was in j un i or high because I had to study for ex a m ( s ) .
I have had the f l u since T u es day morning .
On w ed ne s day I only work ed ti ll 1 0 o ' clock . I had a f ever so I went home .
L at er in the day I took me d ic in e and the next morning I felt better . I de c id ed to go to work .
A t 1 2 o ' clock I was more or less good , but la ter I felt we a k again .
I took to day and tomorrow off so I w o n ' t in f e c t other people . That would be a pro ble m because the who le comp an y would close .
C ur r ent ly I ' m feel ing better . I sp ent all day in be d try ing to he al up .
I ho pe I ' ll feel better soon , tomorrow ma x .
I like listen ing to English po d c a st s very much .
They ' re free and there is a l ot of interest ing i nformation you can get from them .
It con s is t s of all English , so it help s you to think in English .
I es pe c i ally re c o m m en d w or d s from the B e g in n er L es s on which explain s w or d ' s mean ing s in simple English .
I went to a s us h i re st a ur ant with my p ar ent s
My mo m like s s us h i so we some time s go to s us h i re st a ur ant s .
We have a favor ite st or e ; that st or e ' s s ta f f is kind to us and tell s us f un st or ies .
I eat a l ot of s us h i if I go to there .
I do n ' t like was a b i because I c ry if I eat too much was a b i .
I know that most for e i g n er s do n ' t like was a b i either .
D o for e i g n er s say J a p an e se ho r s er ad ish ?
I am a 1 st year un ive r s ity st ud ent in J a p an at K y us h u un ive r s ity .
E ver y on e who is study ing J a p an e se , let ' s talk !
My favor ite things about for e i g n c ul ture are the s im p s on s , o as is ( b and ) ,
I went to D al la s with my friend s for 4 night s , and 5 days after I finish ed my s um m er class es .
I thought they would fight but they would not ; they show ed j ud g es the K un g - F u for m s and the j ud g es gra d ed their perform ance s .
We stay ed at my friend ' s a un t ' s house and they have 4 kid s and we have 4 kid s with us . I le ar n ed that kid s like a person that pay s the most at ten tion to them .
Well , this was about my ro ad tri p .
I am going to make a new ent ry when I come up with a to p ic .
One of my dr e a m s .
I have go ne there since last year .
I ' m am never a b s ent from there .
But I do n ' t study in my home .
So I ' m not good at speak ing English .
I ' m try ing to study every day at home from now on .
And I want to speak English s m o o th ly .
It ' s one of my dr e a m s .
To m or r ow F ri day . To m or r ow is B la c k F ri day .
It ' s good for people , but my A m er ic an friend s . say they w o n ' t go there because every on e go es on B la c k F ri day and the st or es are pack ed .
I started to us e L an g - 8 to day , the first day in 2 0 1 1 .
I stay ed in E ng l and for a month up to two days before C h ri st m as e ve in 2 0 1 0 , which was the first tri p to a for e i g n country for me .
This made me re c o g n i z e that co m m un ic ation to other s , es pe c i ally people not only J a p an e se , is very f un .
S in ce my English is very poor , I was not able to talk to a l ot of English people .
B y us ing L an g - 8 , I would like to im p ro ve my English s k i ll s and make friend s around the world .
- in K or e a ( While the ho st is not even think ing of s er v ing c a ke , the gue st dr in k s the k im ch i j u ic e first . ) V er y interest ing saying !
So c c er is more p op ul ar than b a se b a ll .
So c c er b a ll s are big g er than b a se b a ll s .
B a se b a ll s are hard er than so c c er b a ll s .
B a se b a ll is as p op ul ar as so c c er .
A b a se b a ll game is as good as a so c c er game .
So c c er play er s run s as f a st as b a se b a ll play er s .
S ever al month s a g o , I went to M o un t T a i with a friend of mi ne and her mother .
she live d in sh and on g province , so I went to her home first and visit ed with her mother .
after re st ing for a f e w days , we set out on the j o ur ne y !
M o un t T a i is a f a m ous to ur is t de st in ation
as soon as we ar ri v ed , we dr e w up a de ta il ed p l an .
We de c id ed to start the c l im b at 7 o ' clock p m .
Then we could ar r ive at the mo un tain t op before s un ri se .
M o un t T a i is f a m ous for it ' s s un ri se , but not every on e who come s can see it , because there is a strong we a ther fact or .
We ' re S O L U C K Y ! We saw it .
I took l ot s of p h ot o s .
It was a f ant a st ic j o ur ne y .
It ' s the 3 r d less on , and I want to le ar n how to s ing .
But some time s I re ally ho pe I can enjoy s ing ing like other s do .
This m us ic class may do me some good , but I am not sure .
B e c a us e last time , we s an g a sen t ence for the first time .
O ur home w or k was to le ar n a so ng and s ing it in to night ' s class .
There , I will find out if I have le ar n ed how to s ing .
The te m p er a ture was probab ly less than 1 0 de g re es .
But I re ally felt ha p p y as I heard the mo t or c y c le ' s e ng in e in front of my s al on .
It was a Ka w as a k i , which has a ma s c u line im age .
He took a mo t or b i ke to ur in H o k k a id o this s um m er and he almost when around all of H o k k a id o .
I have been there on my mo t or c y c le long a g o too , but I have n ' t go ne around it yet .
H is story made me ha p p y and in s p ir ed me to do the same thing .
S t ud y ing for ex a m s is very , very interest ing .
S t ud y ing is good , because it help s me le ar n a l ot . ( ? )
I like to study account ing es pe c i ally , because I find it ent er tain ing and us e ful .
So then , let ' s start study ing again .
A f e w month s a g o , I went to U en o Z o o .
U en o is l o c at ed in Tokyo , J a p an .
I want ed to see the two p and as .
When I looked at them , one p and a was eat ing bamboo gra s s , and the other one was sleep ing .
P and as are very c ut e an im al .
I l o ve p and as .
But before we could see the p and as , it was ne ce s s ar y to stand in line for a long time .
I did n ' t like it .
B e c a us e it made me tired .
It ra in ed all day yesterday .
I like ra in y days .
I do n ' t know why , but I just like that sound .
I s there something to eat on a ra in y days in other co un t ri es ?
In K or e a people eat bu ch im g a e on a ra in y day .
but our family did n ' t have bu ch im g a e .
How come we for g ot about that ?
In s te ad we at e ch ic k en and watch ed the world c up .
f m is a language study sit e .
I st ud i ed six ty w or d s a little while a g o .
B y the way , I had a dr e a m that I took a s k ate b o ar d to school ,
but I f e ll in front of school .
He is am a z ing !
I like his s k ate b o ar d ing style !
I took an ex a m in ation in P h y s ic s to day .
But I still have t est s in , mathematics , English , G er man , and e le c t ri c c ir c u it .
So this even ing I will eat out with my friend .
M a y b e we will eat ra m en .
I ' ll start to write this di ar y again .
T w o year s a g o , I had to study for an entrance ex a m in ation and was in trouble .
To tell [ you ] the tru th , she is a v o c al s y n th es i z er .
No t only pro s ing er s , but am ate ur s can [ also ] c re ate their own m us ic .
Some people s an g v o c al o id ' s so ng s and made their de b ut as pro s ing er s .
I think it is interest ing that any on e [ can ] make [ m us ic ] , ly ri c s , and make H A T S U N E M i ku s ing .
T h an k s to her , we [ have ] va ri ous way s of enjoy ing m us ic .
F or ex amp le , `` K A I T O `` is one of the v o c al o id s who s ing s in [ a ] man ' s voice .
I want to try c re at ing my own m us ic some day .
I think it is better that I go sleep and be ha p p y in s te ad .
My friend just left me now so I have no one to talk to . : ( ha ha sound s s ad but not that much . . .
[ What interest ed you about l i b r ar ies and i nformation s c i ence ]
A c t u ally , I a c c id ent ally entered this de p ar t ment .
Then I saw this de p ar t ment and I was n ' t sure about what this is going to tea ch , but I thought this might have something to do with comp ut er s which I ' m quite interest ed in , so I de c id ed to give it a try .
I have p l ent y of things I like to do , like draw ing , de s i g n ing some hand ic r a f t s , s ing ing , b a k ing , play ing v o ll e y b a ll , listen ing to m us ic , e t c .
I gue s s it ' s because I like to make something myself which will make me feel a great sen se of a ch i e ve ment .
S um m er b re a k here begin s from the end of J un e to the begin n ing of S ept e m b er .
it is im p or t ant for my live u .
But it does n ' t get any better .
L a st night my father came back from work and g l ance d at me and said , `` I think you ' ve ga in ed we i g h t some h ow . . . ``
I c he c k ed my we i g h t on the s c al e . O op s , I did ga in 4 k g .
I know it ' s not that big of a de al , but I w an n a stay in sha pe .
This morning I started to work out and run , and did it just now .
No y is still in front of her comp ut er and will may b e sp en d more time with her comp ut er to do al ot of things .
but she will o c c as ion ally come to L an g - 8 to write her di ar y .
she can stay at her house without the b or ing hot we a ther .
I ho pe to day is a good day for my friend s on L an g - 8
This so ng is old but while you help me c or re c t my j o ur n al I would like you to enjoy to listen ing to this so ng too .
than k you so much for your help .
He ll o , I live in U k r a in e . It is not a very big country , but it is a very beautiful and old country ! ! !
U k r a in e has a very old history . M an y to ur is t s from other co un t ri es come here ! !
We have many place s where we can sp en d time to g e ther !
I ho pe you will help me with my English . ) )
This one is the l ate st and big g est new s piece in J a p an .
It is said that he k il led a B ri t ish 2 2 - year old woman who was an English teacher living in J a p an .
( I do n ' t re m e m b er ex a c t ly how old she was . I am sorry if I am wrong .
He has had p la st ic s ur g er y many time s . He has change d his own face and he has been run n ing from the police for near ly 3 year s now .
I heard that both of his p ar ent s are do c t or s . He was s m ar t and he went to a great co ll e g e .
So I thought may b e he had a l ot of p re s s ur e ment ally and that might be re la ted to this m ur d er ing r amp age .
I think that ' s one thing we must never do .
I thought he might find it re l i e v ing if he would be ar re st ed .
I read a new s ar t ic le about this on the in ter ne t . It said that some on e said he is a good look ing man .
I re ally feel sorry for the v ic t im ; a l o ve ly B ri t ish woman , her family and also for the m ur d er er ' s family .
I wish for world pe a ce without ho r ri ble m ur d er s like this , dis aster s and all bad matter s ! .
While I was talk ing with my co w or k er to day , I seemed to have been just see ing my co w or k er .
I tri ed to change my f o c us that I looked at my feel ing s s ever al time s .
A ll my co w or k er s are kind to me , so I ' m usual ly ha p p y when I work .
I want to be honest with my feel ing .
And then I always feel ha p p y .
My c l in ic does n ' t have so many p at i ent s .
But once some p at i ent s come in , they talk about their live s , so I also talk about my feel ing a little .
It was f un .
I ' m ha p p y with everything to day .
I ' ve become a p re m i um me m b er
I ' m a new c ome r .
T h ough I visit ed la ng - 8 for the first time only a f e w days a g o , I l o ve it .
I gue s s the comp an y which run s it need s c ash .
So I ' ve de c id ed to pay for p re m i um me m b er s h i p .
I ho pe the comp an y will gr ow large like face b ook .
Some time s I have many day d re a m s and d ur ing the se day d re a m s there are many r and o m things in my head , I some time s feel that I want to me e t all my friend s in the past and think that now it is im po s s i ble to do that : (
I know th at it ' s past time and they are bu s y with their act i v ity : 9 how s ad it is to be se p ar at ed from each other .
This is the re al ity of life . : / bad things and good things have become me m or ies in my head
act u ally I saw over 5 0 0 pe op le yesterday .
it was just beautiful . we s an g for G o d with all our heart .
B as ed on my ex pe ri ence , those saying J a p an e se is easy to m aster usual ly turn out to have an in s u f f ic i ent command of the language .
To day ' s op p on ent is the strong est tea m in my are a ' s co ll e g e .
I will do my be st .
To day , I could n ' t be mo t i v at ed to do anything .
My school class es start next week .
I thought that al th ough my mind did n ' t want to go to school yet , my so ul or my body might .
W he ther I like it or not , the time is coming .
We will stay there for about a week .
We will not s w im in the o ce an .
R e ad b ook s , listen ing to m us ic and for g e t about da i ly life in J a p an .
I do n ' t know much about the P h il i p p in es but I ' ll try to find something that I have never ex pe ri ence d before .
I ho pe to have a good con ver s ation with the l o c al people .
When I went back to J a p an and had another tri p to Ka g o s h im a , in the so u ther n part of J a p an , I asked for that f r u it .
But I could n ' t find them and asked whether I could find it in the s up er m ar ke t .
E ver y on e said that they had never see n R a m b ut an no r heard the name .
A c t u ally , it is pro h i b it ed to gr ow ra m b ut an in J a p an .
for some on - s al e it e m s that can be us ed in my study are a .
I want to c re ate a co f f e e sh op - like en v ir on ment .
I always enjoy to study in S t ar st r u c k or P an er a C a f e .
L a st year s I b ough t some $ 2 P a in ting s and one $ 2 0 s tain less s in k and some very good qu al ity t able to p s for only $ 5 each .
Some day , I will go to N Y to see her .
This is one of my dr e a m s .
M an y do ll s are display ed on a ti er ed stand for do ll s .
I like the five m us ic i an do ll s name d ` go n in - b a y ash i ` .
They play a f l ut e , dr um s , a hand dr um , and a go ng .
One of them also s ing s a so ng .
To day I play ed a y ut con t est in the ch ur ch .
I ' m feel ing good .
To who ever read s this stuff
I did n ' t sleep d ur ing class .
and went back home where I at e a one - p ot dis h c ook ed at the t able .
A fter w ar d s I went to English c r a m school .
Some of them are re ally wonder ful , however , some P o d c a st s are hard for me to understand .
I need to listen many time s before I can catch them without the le ar n ing g u id es .
So I got an a idea , that I ' ll tra n s l ate the con t ent of f a m ous English P o d c a st s into C h in e se , le ar n ing by this pro ce s s and sh ar ing with all of you guy s !
P le a se help c or re c t my mistake s .
However , from now on , I de c id ed to write my da i ly ro ut in es in this we b s ite f re qu ent ly to im p ro ve and p r a c t ic e my e ng l ish writing s k i ll .
When I was a ch il d , my dr e a m was to own a do g .
When he stood up , he was as ta ll as me .
When I got back home , I would say `` he ll o , I ' m home ! `` .
Then the do g would come to me with his ta il w a g g ing .
B e c a us e I have a job , I do n ' t have enough time to take care of a p up p y .
However after I read some do g ma g a z in es I began to im a g in e living with a do g .
No w , I want a We l s h C or g i !
D o we need English as off ic i al language ?
They think if they con t in u e to us e J a p an e se as the off ic i al language , they c a n ' t e m p l o y people from over se as that c a n ' t speak J a p an e se but have ex ce ll ent s k i ll s .
F ur ther m or e , R a ku ten in ten d s to s a c k c or p or ate office r s if they are not will ing or can not le ar n English with in two year s of it s de c is ion .
The number of e m p l o y e es that c a n ' t us e English also will be re d u c ed .
I heard that they us e English at meeting s now , even though all at ten d e es are J a p an e se .
Some J a p an e se b l o g g er s say that it ' s an ex ce ll ent de c is ion because J a p an e se e m p l o y e es will be able to co m m un ic ate with over se as e m p l o y e es and c ust ome r s more easily than before if they le ar n English .
U s u ally people from over se as can understand English even if they ' re not from English - speak ing co un t ri es .
On the other hand , there are people that c ri t ic i z e it .
Even e m p l o y e es that po s se s s a high command of the English L an g u age c a n ' t con ve y de ta il ed intention s in English as well as in J a p an e se .
J a p an e se e m p l o y e es will not be able to co m m un ic ate well with one another .
It will b r ing about a d ver se effect s on the f ir m s and e m p l o y e es .
I to t ally agree that English is im p or t ant for g l o b al co m m un ic ation .
What do you think about it ?
A st ud ent c he at ed on the K y ot o U n ive r s ity ' s entrance ex a m s .
M e an w h i le , it at t r a c ted con t ro ver s y d u e to K y ot o un ive r s ity ' s and the me d i a ' s a ction s .
Some people re p ro a ch not only the st ud ent but also the a ction s of the un ive r s ity and me d i a .
My English teacher told me about this we b sit e , so from to day I ' ll try to write English di ar y ent ri es .
I went to my English teacher ' s less on to day , but it was his last less on
because he will go back to his country next M on day .
I ' m a re s id ent do c t or in J a p an , yesterday I work ed in e m er g en c y
room through o ut the night .
To day I had to keep work ing
He ll o , every on e !
I am new in this we b s ite .
I want to le ar n English well .
I ho pe some on e can see it and help me by
mo d if y ing my ar t ic le or in t ro d u ce a good way of im p ro v ing English .
A l s o the day after tomorrow
A l s o come s the day after tomorrow .
A F e w month s to make the t ar g e t by myself .
It also give s us the p ow er of one s el f .
I must le ar n English , but every on e know s my le ve l is too l ow .
When I was a j un i or high school st ud ent , my English class teacher laugh ed at me , because my pro n un c i ation was un i qu e for him .
E ver y day I ' m very bu s y because of my life and job .
On ly when I study a for e i g n language do I feel ha p p y .
A good speak er may b e is not a good w or k er .
I am not a good work er , I always have some mistake .
I took my so n s to a B ar b er sh op this morning , and then to a one co in sh op , `` D a is o `` .
My 2 - year - old so n like s to be he l d in my ar m s .
I usual ly say to him , `` Let ' s walk with your own feet . `` , but he re p l ies , `` H o l d me in your ar m s , please ! ``
B e c a us e he had the op p or t un ity to bu y his favor ite s n a c k .
I me t a bo y on line last night ,
, and cha t ted with him for about an hour .
He is work ing in the U S ,
and he told me that my English is more f l u ent and better than that of his co w or k er s who came from C h in a .
M an y of them have work ed and live d there for a long time , but their English is still not very good .
it is funny .
ho pe I can be ar to live in another province or c ity .
M an y J a p an e se p ar ent s go to the sh ri ne when their b a b ies turn one month old .
It is called `` O m i y a m a i ri `` .
It ' s purpose is to give than k s for a he al th y - b or n b a b ies and wish them to gr ow up he al th y .
The b a b ies we ar k im on o when they go to `` O m i y a m a i ri `` .
I have n ' t written a di ar y re c ent ly , but s ud d en ly I want ed to write to day ,
It ' s a fine day !
It is a very n ic e day in Tokyo .
but it is a little b it co l d .
M an y people in the affect ed are as are having trouble s .
What can I do ?
I will s a ve e le c t ri c ity & ga s .
I want to help the help less .
I want to give ho pe to the ho pe less .
C an You do anything ?
I d ropped my i P o d to u ch in ( a / the ) to i le t b ow l last week and it s an k .
I only b ough t it three month s a g o , but in this case the pro ble m s were cause d by water , so it was out of w ar r ant y .
It was a p ity .
P ro ble m s cause d by water c a n ' t be f i x ed , so I ex change d the i P o d To u ch for a new one at ( an / the ) A p p le st or e .
It co st me 2 0 0 0 0 y en ( about 2 0 0 do ll ar s ) to ex change , which is half the p ri ce of a new one .
I want A p p le to make a water p ro o f i P o d .
When I was a ch il d here in J a p an , there was gr ound ing , which ( might have ) last ed for a per i o d .
I re m e m b er I was c ry ing and bu m p ing ( hi t ting ) the do or .
To day , I went to O d a i b a in Tokyo with my friend by c ar .
U n f or t un ate ly , to day was so w in d y ; it was a b it hard for us to walk .
But the pro ble m will be run n ing out of b re a th . ( v v ; )
How can I write a n ic e person al state ment ?
My teacher asked us to write a person al state ment , and she show ed us some ex amp le s in which there were va ri ous tra g ed ies such as p ar ent di v or ce , serious i ll ness , and c ar a c c id ent s .
We A d op ted a P us s y c at
We heard the sound of a c at c ry ing when we were walk ing and c he c k ed to see what it was .
When we saw this pretty little c at , we could n ' t leave it alone .
He is g ing er and w h ite with p in k p a w s .
No w he ' s in good condition and always run s and s c r at ch es .
In my opinion la ng - 8 is a good idea for people who le ar n for e i g n language s ; D I ' m sure , I ' ll make a l ot of mistake s but it ' s re ally im p or t ant to try our a b il it ies , is n ' t it ?
I come from P o l and and I ' m S E V E N T E E N year s old .
I ' m in t re st ed in history , litera ture , sp or t , g e o g r a p h y , re l i g i ous e t c .
In my free time I read b ook s ( my f a v o ur ite - th ri ll er s ; D ) , me e t my friend s and watch mo v ies .
I have n ' t done too many interest ing things re c ent ly , because I ' ve been so bu s y in con ne ction with the end of the se m est er at school but w in ter ho l i day s are close ; )
( A t ? school I have G er man too but I ha te it : P ) .
T h in k ing A bout 4 C h an by 2 ch an M ad
It quick ly f as c in at ed me .
It has di r ty j o ke s and is full of v it al ity .
I ' ve been 2 ch an ma d for a de c ad e , and I de e p ly like F ut a b a C h an n el , which in f l u ence d 4 ch an ' s c ul ture and str u c ture .
U s ing re al name s is ra re . + and un w is e +
J a p an e se you ng s ter s of ten talk as if they are on 2 ch an . They talk about idea s from it , and some time s say `` I ' m a 2 ch an n er `` .
But it was a de c ad e a g o when 2 ch began .
So I should get us ed to the new way now , po s s i b ly .
They enjoy th r ow ing di r ty w or d s around .
And I think they are less pro ble m at ic .
C o m p ar ed to 2 ch an , their ha t r ed see m s dis or g an i z ed .
On 2 ch an , they at ta c k ma in ly we a k people . E s pe c i ally K or e an s or C h in e se in J a p an , in te g r at ed people , w ome n , and any on e with a per c i e v ed we a k ness .
They th r ow di r ty w or d s at each other .
they call every on e `` f a g g ot `` .
G a y or straight , man or woman is not an is s u e .
They call G a y as `` f a g g ot `` , straight as straight `` f a g g ot `` .
They call w h ite people `` p i g s `` , and black people `` n i g g er s `` .
So , there is a we ir d e qu al ity .
But I think it ' s better to see Tokyo to w er at N I G H T !
And other p h ot o s are of Z o j o j i temple .
He ll o , every on e , I have come back .
T h an k you for all your care .
Yes ter day I went to a b ook sh op at 1 1 . 0 0 am .
I read a l ot of b ook s there , and one b ook t aught me how to write English well .
It said one should follow the sen ten se for m new paper or b ook .
and then read it again after one has finish ed finish ed writing it .
I tri ed to do that to day .
I will see if my English im p ro ve s or not > <
I ho pe that this ti p may be good for my friend s from here .
I went to Tokyo on a business tri p this week .
So , I could keep a di ar y a little this week .
While I stay ed in Tokyo , I me t my friend .
And I went back to my home t ow n e ar ly morning to day .
The so c c er game of J a p an will start right now .
E ver y on e is not alone , for it is er y people that con s is t of the so c i e ty .
On one hand , some of the people hold this view that one should be re w ar d ed after do ing a good de ed .
No do u b t , it is kind of tra d i tion al C on f u c i an is m .
F or my part , I f ir m ly believe that one who has a kind - heart should be give n a re w ar d or a a p p la us e .
B e c a us e he or she de s er ve s it .
It will have a po s it ive effect on public as well , which would in s p i re more c it i z en s .
A t least , the public me d i a , name ly T V st ation and new s p a p er , not only should re p or t ent er tain ment new s , but also pro po g ate new s of the se out st and ing or d in ar y c it i z en s .
To s um up , more at ten tion s should be pai d to those kind - heart ed person s .

I can re la x and conc ent r ate like
But I ' m not sure about that now .
O f course I still have many friend s but I c a n ' t be sure that they are re ally my friend s honest ly .
I think it depend s on each person ' s think ing about friend s h i p ( ? ) .
We have know n each other more than 1 0 year s , since we were in e le ment ar y school .
No w we still con ta c t each other , but I do n ' t think that she is my good friend any m or e .
When I think about the se things , I feel l on e ly .
In J a p an , there are not any tra d i tion s of having a long s um m er time va c ation , as in F r ance .
I think I am over s le e p ing .
S um m er ho l i day s
The second ter m is f in ally begin n ing .
It is a fine day to day .
I have a teachers meeting and f o l k dance works h op for students .
I have two ho l i day s , tomorrow and the day after tomorrow .
I want to go to an On s en and re la x .
To day is the 5 th of A u g ust .
D o you have any st up id things ( happen ing ) in your life ?
I had something st up id happen this even ing before I came home .
It happen ed when my bo s s told me about a new r ul e :
if an e m p l o y e e does something wrong or does not conc ent r ate on do ing work and make s a mistake ,
she will re d u ce our pay .
What a st up id idea .
I just got this job about one and a half month s a g o , do you expect me to be per f e c t ?
My bo s s expect s it .
I think once I pass three month s I will im p ro ve .
I want to get more friend s
H i , every body .
C an you find me more friend s ?
My English is very bad .
I always make mistake s in gra m m ar .
I want to make friend s with who can speak English .
I like to make friend s .
I will sha re my life and my feel ing s with you if you will be my friend .
In fact , it ' s just been half a year but I feel like it has been so many year s .
F or I have been study ing in another c ity for one year .
I have become very home s ic k .
On J u ly 1 1 my friend and I went home to g e ther by train .
It took about 9 hour s to ar r ive in H an g z h o u .
I c a n ' t believe a so ng could make me feel so s ad . It had re ally n ic e ly ri c s though .
A n y way I re ally enjoy ed it for ma k ing me c ry T _ T
But it see m s trouble s ome for her to write a j o ur n al .
She has a second name , A ur or a .
She told me it will be e as i er to talk with for e i g n er s with it .
D o you think As i an people ' s name s are difficult to re m e m b er ?
There is a s w im m ing po o l that is l o c at ed inside my ne i g h b or h o o d .
It be l on g s to an e le ment ar y school .
The ma in purpose of the po o l is to tea ch ch il d re n how to s w im .
P e op le are not all ow ed to j um p in the water at the end of the po o l because it is too da ng er ous .
The p ri ce is 5 0 N T do ll ar s for an a d ul t .
I us ed to s w im 5 0 0 me ter s every time I went there .
I want to in c re a se my ra ng e of s w im m ing .
To make s w im m ing more c he a p er for me .
A lady I know w a v ed to me . She is a friend that I me t when I went to s w im m ing school last time .
I was so ha p p y as well that I still could a friend who still re m e m b er ed me after one year .
and she always en c o ur age s me to s w im quick ly .
I could get down to sleep , but once I w o ke up in the middle of the night , it was very difficult to go back to sleep again .
But all the things made me stay a w a ke even more !
I do n ' t know why that in s o m n i a had started and end ed .
But it does n ' t work for me .
I ' ve had a co l d since the day before yesterday . No t he a v y , though .
This is the first time I ' ve had a co l d this year .
My voice is n as al now , and does not feel very good .
But they never work .
I will just wait for my co l d to go away .
M a y b e having a good sleep is the be st way to c ur e a co l d .
I will try it .
But I do n ' t know if it will work or not .
I took a me d ical c he c k - up just a month a g o .
I dr in k but not like a fish . Some time s I dr in k that way , though .
L O L I am a me m b er of a sp or t s c l u b .
I know I should ex er c is e more and los e a b it of we i g h t .
I want to live for a long time and be he al th y .
To day , I j o in ed la ng - 8 .
B y talk ing with them , I can know va ri ous sen se s of va l u es , and people who are el d er than me kind ly tell me many ti p s for my life .
We had l un ch with those who se house had been f l o o d ed in the t s un a m i .
A l th ough th s house has almost been re p a ir ed , there was a water line where the water came up to . ? ? ? ?
I brought my bo x ed l un ch which was full .
But they serve d dis he s such as t s u ke m on o , s an s a i ( mo un tain ve g e t able s ) , and some s n a c k s in sp ite of having little f o o d .
I at e them and they were all good .
I felt a b it sorry , however , they smile d at me and said `` E at more : ) al th ough there was n ' t p l ent y of f o o d
A ll of us than k ed you guy s : ) `` They are kind and t ough ( even if they dis g u is ed it ) .
I was en c o ur age d to do something more hard er than before .
I could make friend s with many people through being a volunteer .
I de c id ed to go and volunteer to help them again . ? ? ? ? ?
My 7 th di ar y
I will have a l ot of class es on t u es day .
And the class like mi c ro e c on o m ic s is too difficult for me to understand .
R e c ent ly , I ` ve wonder ed why I took up e c on o m ic s .
But , I must study and get credit .
On ce I understand the less on , I think it will be fine .
So , I ` ll study hard and find something interest ing about e c on o m ic s .
I ' m j o in ing in the C P U pro j e c t .
We read a b ook about `` How to make a C P U `` and we ' re act u ally do ing it there .
To day I us ed a so l d er ing ir on and made a R O M a ccord ing to the b ook ' s in st r u ction s .
A fter I came back home , I dr an k a c up of al c o h o l .
It of ten ra in s in the sp r ing .
D o you ha te ra in y days ?
I am so fond of listen ing to this :
D o you think it ' s good , or do n ' t you ?
R a in y days too .
A di al o gue on a bu s :
A pass e ng er : O h , your b a b y is very c al m on the bu s .
She like s to be on the bu s .
I always write about mo v ies the se days .
B e c a us e I can find interest ing c ul t ur al di f f er ence s in it .
I l o ve m us ic and dance , so I enjoy ed it : ) I was am a z ed many act re s s are able to s ing , dance and act ! ! !
I became fond of her ever since I watch ed `` A l m o st f a m ous `` .
S t r an g e ly , many people do n ' t understand that some time s a man watch es it just alone and some people feel sh y ( about it ) .
any way , I will just have to go the c in e m a alone and then bu y a sweet p op c or n and co la and then enjoy the time alone .
M a y b e , I think that I ' m re ally a tru e man who re ally enjoy s a mo v i e .
do you agree with my opinion : ) . .
I am going to stay in B a th tomorrow night , so I ho pe to sleep well there .
When we go to be d , other people w a ke up on the op po s ite side of the e ar th . ``
`` there is a bo o g er on the desk ! `` And she said to me ,
`` It ' s your s ! `` I s m ir k ed .
And she said with smile on her face ,
`` G ro s s ! `` Y e t , it sound ed to me as if she had like d it .
A fter that short sp at , the small to - do was qu el led .
Even now she insist s it was mi ne .
It was not mi ne .
just saying he ll o
`` P r in ce s s M on on o ke , `` one of S T U D I O G H I B L I ' s great est works , was in s p ir ed by the at m o s p he re of the is l and .
O ver 2 0 year s a g o , I was t re k k ing to the to p of the is l and ' s M t .
I gr op ed my way for w ar d with the help of a small head l amp and man age d to re a ch a hu t .
I need ed to have b re a k f a st and p re p ar e for the next s te p ( j o ur ne y ? ) .
So I walk ed down the tra il I had pass ed the night before to get some water .
There was no body but the tree and I in the my st ic at m o s p he re , and I felt like he had called me there .
This ex pe ri ence was and always will be my p re c i ous me m or y .
I m p a c t of the t s un a m i was far be y on d our im a g in ation .
What happen ed to me to day
When we s ud d en ly understand the language which we have been study ing without think ing , it make s us ha p p y .
To day I had that ex pe ri ence while watch ing J a p an e se new s .
In J a p an re c ent ly we have heard a l ot about b r ut al m ur d er s ' here and there .
One of the most f a m ous m ur d er er s we ' ve been he ar ing about was ar re st ed just thirty minute s a g o .
A fter he k il led a B ri t ish woman who was teaching English in J a p an , he went into hi d ing for two year s .
The woman ' s father came to J a p an to appeal to the police to sea r ch for the m ur d er er many time s unti l he was ar re st ed .
The police str u g g led in their sea r ch for him , and two week s a g o a ti p that he had been sight ed in N a g o y a was b ro ad c a st through the me d i a .
In the end he was ar re st ed in O s a k a though .
When I was watch ing the new s , the new s c aster s ud d en ly started speak ing English and started to in ter v i e w the v ic t im ' s father .
When I listen ed to the father speak English , I was most ly able to understand what he said .
S in ce my d aught er was c ur i ous about what he was saying , I tra n s la ted it into J a p an e se for her .
U s u ally when we listen in ter v i e w s in English through the me d i a , we can read sub t it le s in J a p an e se .
However , the in ter v i e w happen ed s ud d en ly ; the sub t it le s were n ' t p re p ar ed in time .
There f or e , I was able to listen to the in ter v i e w in English without J a p an e se sub t it le s .
The father was c ry ing and very gr ate ful to the & n b s p ; J a p an e se police .
I would like to listen to new s st or ies in English more of ten from now on .
If p at ent ex ha us tion were to be in e v it able by condition al s al es , con s um er s would enjoy more un c on d i tion al s al es .
U n d er such circumstance s , `` s el f - re p l ic ation `` ty pe pro d u c t s , such as ce ll line s or so f t w ar e , should require p at ent l ic en se re p l ic ation .
I will have the first ex a m at my new school on O c t 9 .
I want to leave a good impress ion on my new teachers .
So I re v is e the less ion s I have le ar n t d ur ing the ho l i day .
I ' m afraid I c a n ' t be the be st in our class .
N e x t , I will con t in u e re v is ing .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to the ex a m .
I W ish I can get a good re s ul t .
He ll o , n ic e to me e t you !
To m or r ow , I have an in ter v i e w t est .
`` T e ll about something which impress ed you d ur ing this se m est er and something which has dis a p po in ted you ,
and give three reason s for each . ``
He l p ! ! !
The class that impress ed me d ur ing this se m est er was `` In t ro d u ction for ( My un ive r s ity name ) st ud ies `` .
The first reason is because the le c ture had a different p rofessor each time . I could he ar a un i qu e le c ture which was n ' t from my f i el d .
S e c on d ly , the point s of each f i el d are s um m ar i z ed in each le c ture , so I could understand the education al
I have n ' t thought of yet X (
To make a long story short . ( am I right ? ) To be honest I do n ' t have a long story , L O L !
I mean a person ' s fight c a n ' t change the world , even c a n ' t change himself , so it mean s nothing .
But his a ction may en c o ur age other s who know this , and year to year the world can be change d .
When I us ed the w or d `` b a m `` I mean t c he at .
R A V I , I want to know why did you c or re c t the w or d `` b or n `` into `` bo re `` in the sen t ence `` I told them may b e their mo m s b or n them in or d er `` , what I want to say is , their mo m s made a de al with their b ir th day s and then bo re one each day in or d er .
I think the side effect s of this me d ic in e is pretty strong , My mouth has an ul c er again .
L a st time I had this kind of ant i b i ot ic me d ic in e was when my too th was p ul led out , and I got a mouth u c l er bad ly , this happen d again .
I stay ed at home for the who le day , watch ed f il m s , read a b ook , you know that I read some pretty good ar t ic le s , b ook s give me pe a ce .
I b ough t j u ic e which was a f r u it and ve g e t able mi x ture , I thought it could im p ro ve my im m un ity , but it was too co l d , and I had to mi x hot water in . The funny thing was that I could n ' t me as ur e how much hot water I need ed , so the mi x ture was either ( too ) hot or ( too ) co l d , which made my th ro at ( even ) more un c o m f or t able T _ T .
B a c k to the to p ic , I was think ing that I need ed some m us ic when I was having dinner , so I just c l ic k ed here and there on my comp ut er ( in my comp ut er ?
I did n ' t re m e m b er when I had copie d them from D V D s .
I re m e m b er ed that the first time I watch ed a M ic ha el J a c k s on v id e o , was in 1 996 .
Then we re n ted his other V C D s from the st or e .
I just like d the r h y th m .
A fter three year s I listen ed to his m us ic again because one of his m us ic v id e o s , `` man in the mi r r or `` I was sh o k ed by this v id e o , I did n ' t know what to say , I was im p a c ted . C o m ment : M e too
I found that I had n ' t see all his m us ic v id e o s , I did n ' t re ally know him , after w ar d I read some i nformation about him .
I watch ed T r an s s i b er i an , B ur n A fter R e ad ing , and T r a it or to day .
The be ne f it of i ll ness is that I can watch f il m s all day .
I watch So u th p ar k for le ar n ing English , but I c a n ' t understand all their j o ke s .
I did n ' t watch A qu a T e en H un g er F or ce , but I will , you know I never mi s s out on anything good , L O L !
`` One P i e ce `` is a J a p a ness c ar t o on , it is a pretty good s er ies !
I had enough !
If I re c a ll anything , I will tell you in my dr e a m ! !
This is my first time to write something here .

A t that time , I had to read many te ch n ical b ook s and some P or t u gue se translation s of English te x t s that were so poor that it was e as i er try ing to understand the original one s .

A month a g o , my English teacher a d v is ed that we can im p ro ve listen ing comp re h en s ion by listen ing to V O A or B B C .
B e c a us e I have trouble listen ing , I ch o se to listen to the V O A sp e c i al English - education re p or t .
I listen to it almost every day .
The first time I could catch some w or d s and simple sen t ence s .
The second time , I read the te x t and tra n s l ate it .
The th ir d time , I can comp le te ly understand every w or d and their mean ing s .
What ' s your a d v ic e ?
How can I us e V O A better ?
U N I Q L O and The ir B us i ness S t r ate g y
If you live in or have v is ted J a p an , I am sure you have heard of U N I Q L O .
It ' s among the most f a m ous c l o th ing st or es in J a p an .
I read an in ter v i e w of the found er and I found it quite interest ing .
H is name is T ad ash i Ya n a i , a J a p an e se b i ll ion a i re .
He is ra n k ed at 8 9 in `` F or b es b i ll ion a i re l is t . ``
F ir st of all , what dis ting u ish es U N I Q L O is that they provide high - qu al ity b as ic s with an a f f or d able p ri ce ta g .
One of their f e a ture it e m s is the so - called ' he at te ch in n er . ``
It ' s a th in in n er ga r ment but it g en er ate s he at by it s el f . It ' s very us e ful , es pe c i ally in w in ter .
M o st of my friend s in J a p an we ar it for every day us e .
U N I Q L O now has 7 5 0 bra n ch es includ ing 4 bra n ch es a b ro ad .
The great er the ri s k , the great er the po s s i b il ity for pro f it s `` .
In my opinion , what he said is tru e . However , when you are at the to p , you are also respon s i ble for your co - work er s and their family .
I also believe it has some interest in l u c k and your back g r ound .
You may need f in an c i al s up p or t from your p ar ent s . Some people s u c ce ed very easily because of their family .
No w I just read the l ate st new s that U N I Q L O has an no un c ed that they are going to change their comp an y ' s co m m on language to English from 2 0 1 2 - 2 0 1 3 in or d er to keep up with g l o b al gr ow th .
I find that interest ing .
It is a one hour dr ive from my place .
The we a ther was re l at ive ly mi l d and clear so , it was a per f e c t day to play ten n is outside .
The place is on a hi ll s id e and we can view a ri ver and mo un tain s over the ten n is co ur t .
C an you see the small w h ite part in the picture ?
I find that C h in e se ex a m s are more difficult than English ex a m s .
I wish I could be an A m er ic an in next life but can speak C h in e se well .
I had more sp ar e time than usual .
And then I me m or i z ed us e ful express ion s and w or d s , al th ough some of them s l i p p ed out of my mind easily .
Well , the re c or d ing s of te x t b ook s , which I re g ul ar ly listen to , are p il ing up , so not only should I keep up with every less on , but I should also re v i e w the back number s not to for g e t the new w or d s , e t c .
`` I should not only keep up with . . . . . , but also re v i e w . . . . . ``
I me t a man de ve l op ing me d ical in st r u ment s there .
I ' d like to as k about him the in d ust ry because I have been study ing b i ome d ical e ng in e er ing .
I know we will talk about many things but I am not p re p ar ed yet .
If I make a mistake , what I will do then ?
This is my first time to write a di ar y on this we b .
I never think about being able to c or re c t other people ' s er r or in my n at ive language .
I was star v ing , because I had n ' t eat en b re a k f a st or l un ch .
A l ot of different me at s were serve d one after another .
I also tri ed a bo t t le of P er u v i an be er called `` C ry st al ``

No w I am en ro ll ed in a un ive r s ity in J a p an and I ma j or in D ent is t ry .
S t ar ting to day , I should do c l in ical train ing s every day ex c ept d ur ing w e e k en d s .
I was very n er v ous d ur ing the train ing , but I man age d to pass .
F ir st , I have to tell you that . . .
and that all of my family and friend s are s a f e .
I could n ' t go home on the night because of a full s us p en s ion of the train s er v ic e , so I walk ed to my home which took hour s . I did not ar r ive unti l the next morning .
It was good ex er c is e for me .
( In fact , I was re ally s c ar ed by the e ar th qu a ke . . .
It help ed me con t in u e to be f ir m .
We have face d two serious and un e x pe c ted dis aster s I . e . both the e ar th qu a ke and t s un a m i .
There are people who have los t their home s .
We have re c o ver ed from c ri se s many time s .
We re c o ver ed from the Tokyo D a ish in s a i and the H an s h in D a ish in s a i .
which language should I ch o o se ?
if you were me , what would you do ?
G er man - I have le ar n ed / st ud i ed it for one year , but I can only read without understand ing it s mean ing .
J a p an e se - I am re ally interest ed in it , but I know nothing about it now , I like to watch j a p an e se c ar t o on s very much .
please you have ex pe ri ence le ar n ing language s , so give me some suggest ion s .
It has been ra in ing all day long .
But I was still dr en ch ed with ra in .
I had to change my dress when I got home .
A fter me al s , I have to study for a dr i v ing t est .
I ' ve f a il ed it t w ic e , there f or e I ho pe I pass the next t est .
To day , one of my friend s told me a funny story .
She was talk ing to me about her tri p to S c ot l and , when she re m e m b er ed something about a t - shirt works h op .
She said :
`` We were in a t - shirt works h op , and my friend s , who like a l ot of ra p m us ic , de c id ed to make t - shirt s with a me s s age that show ed their pass ion by ra p p ing .
They w ro te the ti t le me s s age ( `` I l o ve my ra p p er `` x D ) .
When they were walk ing by the street , people laugh ed a l ot while look ing at them , and they did n ' t know why the people were laugh ing .
Then , they dis c o ver ed that `` ra p er `` in English does n ' t mean `` person who s ing s ra p `` .
They were very e m b ar r as s ed about this . It was very funny .
I think that it ' s a funny story because there are a l ot of time s that we w ro te something wrong because it sound ed like S p an ish w or d s that have different mean ing s .
Yes ter day , my friend s invite d me to a p l an to go water ra f ting and c amp ing with them some day .
They always change their mind s a ccord ing to their mo o d .
A l th ough they made an a w es ome p l an on c amp ing , I am wonder ing if they will ful f i ll it .
T e ch n ic ally , you may say that they not normal so you never know what their next s te p is .
M or e o ver , I ho pe that our c amp ing could be sleep ing in a c amp er but not in a l o g c a b in .
This is because I ' ve never been in a c amp er so far .
On S at ur day , I took a so l o b i ke ri d e up to the so u th are a of K y ot o from my a p ar t ment .
There is a b i ke ro ut e that run s through the are a along the R ive r Y o d o and then the R ive r K i z u .
I like this ro ut e because it ' s f l at from begin n ing to end , al th ough I some time s it ' s hard to ri d e against the w in d s there .
A fter le aving my a p ar t ment , I ro d e to the first point where I p l an n ed to have l un ch .
I took a good re st there and started out again to w ar d the turn ar ound point .
There are tea p l ant ation s along the ri ver , and I saw ri ce f i el d s f il led with water in which the p l ant ing had been almost comp le ted .
D ur ing the ri d e , many ri d er s pass ed me by , as I was pretty s l ow .
A l th ough I w or ri ed about get ting s un b ur n ed and am w or n out from all the hot s un s h in e , I feel great when I finish ri d ing .
I re s um ed dr i v ing school .
In J a p an , people have to gradua te from dr i v ing school with in n in e month s of the en ro ll ment d ate .
I en ro ll ed into dr i v ing school mi d - S ept e m b er , so the de ad line of my gradua tion is mi d - J un e .
I still have three month s to go .
On the other hand , the co st of get ting a dr ive r ' s l ic ence is ra p id ly b a ll o on ing .
J ud g ing from the pro g re s s cha r t , I would end up having sp ent more than $ 3 0 0 0 just to get a dr ive r ' s l ic ence .
Well , most of the in st r u c t or s in school are n ic e and as s id u ous ly tell me how to dr ive and to be a w ar e of .
Y e t $ 3 0 0 0 is too ex p en s ive f or me .
I gue s s , people can get their dr ive r ' s l ic ence s without sp en d ing such an am o un t of money in other co un t ri es .
How much money do you need to pay to get your dr ive r ' s l ic ence or to comp le te dr i v ing school education in your country ?
To day is T h ur s day , and there are no sp e c i al / o c c as ion s .
There is only one different thing , name ly , I became an hour sen d er this after no on .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t like / it .
I like to write / more co d es than that .
But my case has finish ed 3 month s a g o .
So , in addition to mo d if y ing the bu g ( it mean s is s u e ) found by my c l i ent , I am not bu s y .
I took off at 7 p m and went home by mo t or c y c le .
I ' m as k ing all of you includ ing K or e an S .
I want to j o in A N off - line English gr o up but I do n ' t know about that at all .
This effect was that the s k in would become re ne w ed .
B y the time I get mar ri ed , I will have go ne to E s te six time s .
I wonder how I will change .
we c le an ed the w in d ow s , floor s , and was h ed the c ur tain s .
I ' m so tired after do ing all of the se things .
I was a co u ch p ot at o
but from now on , I ' m go n n a study hard and work out .
W at ch ing As i an game s was a time k i ll er .
But like some on e said `` L if e is not a sp e c t at or sp or t `` .
As it ' s get ting co l d the se days , I just eat over and over again like a c r a z y person .
S ud d en ly I just stop p ed watch ing T V and went out for a walk .
I j o g g ed and j um p ed ro pe .
I ' ll go back to the days when I live d every moment .
I want to be able to speak English ,
My F ir st S i g n - In
I ' m us ing this we b s ite for the first time .
W or k H ar d S t ud y H ar d er P la y L es s
I was bu s y at work and hard ly man age d the time between my job and J a p an e se class .
T h an k G o d the hard work pai d off .
I had a good re v i e w and salary raise .
She is a kind teacher and I like to study under her g u id ance .
He ' s a good teacher too .
It ' s trouble s ome for a work ing st ud ent like me .
I ' m de d ic at ing my free time for pro d u c t ive act i v ity .
I only understand simple gr e e ting s .
I did n ' t f an c y the co f f e e but the place has a good ha ng out view .
A t night J a k ar ta has a good me t ro po l it an view with light s every where .
I ' m not sure how to us e it very much .
I want to speak English more s m o o th ly and le ar n about a l ot of for e i g n c ul ture s .
D o ing that , I can see J a p an from a wide r point of view than before .
and I was very ha p p y , I think I will be a d d ic ted to le ar n ing English .
If I can make le ar n ing English interest ing and work hard , I think I will make a l ot of pro g es s !
And than k s to my many In ter ne t friend s for c or re c ting my mistake s !
If you need help with your C h in e se , I will do my be st to help you !
I came B a c k
I came back be c a se the C E T will be he l d .
It look s ter ri ble .
It see m s to me it is the de v il s work .
my point is , that language is us ed to co m m un ic ate with each other .
If you understand my mean ing and I know what you mean then that is enough .
Why do they hold ex a m in ation s to get your language le ve l .
I c a n ' t see how the t est s c or es can re ally re f le c t our language le ve l .
I thought about who I ' ve been .
I ' m 2 5 year s old .
M or e sp e c if ic ally , I thought was that I was bad in some way and that I need ed to im p ro ve myself .
What if I was much better before than I am now ?
What if I ' m head ed in the wrong direction ?
One thing I am sure of is , I was n ' t sha b b y like this before . ( sha b b y ? )
It see m s the more I try to im p ro ve myself the more other things in my life see m to s u f f er . ( f a ll a p ar t )
I think I have re ally de st ro y ed myself in some way s .
F or t un ate ly I know how to make things good again .
T H E E N G L I S H L E C T U R E
so I ' m look ing for some on e who can tea ch me English while I am le ar n ing it by myself .
No w I ' m try ing to re g is ter the English le c ture for the next ter m .
What do you think of this s up p le ment ?
My friend came to my house when I was about to start study ing English this
morning , but we enjoy ed cha t ting .
While cha t ting I re c o g n i z ed that she is into tak ing a s up p le ment called
`` Ka ku s an `` in J a p an e se .
that ty pe of dr in k is quite effect ive for us such as all er g ies , sick ness , can c er , and
and di a b e te s . This s up p le ment is just like an all - around me d ic in e .
However , the p ri ce was too ex p en s ive to keep on tak ing for me .
people had a he at ed ar g u ment about it .
It made me even more con f us e .
She s ud d en ly sat up in be d , in the middle of the night .
A n y way , short story this time so you do n ' t los e so much time : 3 than k s to every on e for read ing , c or re c ting , and commen ting n _ _ n !
to day I ' m going to talk about `` friend ``
comp ar e some on e who sha re s the bad and good
but , most of all my be st friend is like me in every way .
One of my friend s , H i ro k i , told me about this sit e .
T h an k s , H i ro k i !
So I want to im p ro ve my English writing s k i ll s here .
G o l d en We e k - a long va c ation in J a p an
There is a long va c ation called `` G o l d en We e k `` in J a p an from the end of A p ri l to the begin n ing of M a y .
The co st of tra ve l is very high comp ar ed with those at usual time s of the year .
I have not been to for e i g n co un t ri es d ur ing that sea s on , but I p l an to go to H on g K on g and M a c a o with my family this year .
There is a l ot of de l ic i ous f o o d in H on g K on g , so could you re c o m m en d your favor ite to me ?
When I was in C h in a , I only us ed QQ in or d er to cha t w i th my friend s on line .
A l th ough I know F a ce B ook was p op ul ar in the world .
but in C h in a we could n ' t con ne c t with F a ce B ook , because C h in e se go ver n ment all ow ed us to us e R en R en which was a copy from F a ce B ook .
M a y b e it was the first time that I us ed that , ti ll then I could not know whether my friend s are on line or not . ( , ) A l ot s of me s s age s on the F a ce B ook made me feel a b it me s s . ( , ) M a y b e 3 month s la ter it will be more `` easy going `` .
To day I just went to my part time job .
R e c ent ly , the j un k y ar d where I work is very d u ll .
So , to day ' s sh if t was from half past 4 unti l 1 1 .
It ' s usual ly from half past 4 unti l mi d night .
A fter I finish ed work ing , I went back home and went to be d e ar ly .
One ra in y even ing a los t c at w and er ed in . It was comp le te ly we t and c ry ing a l ot .
The old co up le name d her ' M i qu e ' and treat ed her like their re al ch il d .
When a c ust ome r put money on the t able M i ke s ud d en ly s w ept the money down into a money bo x under ne a th with one c ry of `` me ow `` .
The c ust ome r was so de light ed / en r a p ture d that he a d v is ed the old woman to change the name of the sh op from ' Ka ke g a w a - l o c al p ow er ri ce c a ke s ' to simpl y ' C at ri ce c a ke s ' to at t r a c t c ust ome r s to the business .
In a sen se a c ust ome r name d their sp e c i al ty ' C at ri ce c a ke s ' .
He told me the re s ul t s of the perform ance e v al u ation for the past six month s .
I receiv ed the high est point s in our e v al u ation s y s te m .
I ' ve never receiv ed such a high s c or e since I j o in ed this comp an y .
I was de light ed that the man age r s re c o g n i z ed my effort s .
I felt very much a p p re c i at ed .
H on est ly , I get pai d much more than the a ver age J a p an e se person of the same age .
In addition , than k s to this great e v al u ation , I will receiv e a hu g e bo n us this s um m er .
When I think of the am o un t of money I receiv e , I some time s feel a little b it g u il ty .
Even though a l ot of comp an ies and people are str u g g ling with the g l o b al e c on o m ic down t ur n , we always receiv e high s al ar ies .
We me t at the re st a ur ant and at e s al ad .
F or de s s er t there was a surprise c a ke !
S k y pe is very us e ful , and we can make con ta c t with people around the world without any charge , but it has some draw b a c k s .
It is that we must sit in front of our comp ut er s while we us e s k y pe , but I can us e s k y pe every where with my / an i P h on e .
D e c id ing a d ate that is easy to re m e m b er is what ' s im p or t ant !
It sound s like `` than k you `` in English , does n ' t it ?
I went to the a ir p or t to see my w if e ( and our b a b y inside her ) off yesterday .
O ur p l an in the past was that we would go back to J a p an to g e ther around S ept e m b er .
However , she is p re g n ant , so it seemed to be better for her to go back there as e ar ly as possible ( at least in her mother ' s opinion ) .
Then , I started a s ing le life in the U K .
I found the be l ow sit e .
I think no n - l ic en s ed write r s should be a p p re c i at ed more .
To m or r ow , I am volunteer ing for a be a ch c le an up .
in Ka n a g a w a p re f e c ture with my friend .
There was not a t s un a m i after w ar d to day though ,
but now I became an x i ous about the po s s i b il ity of a t s un a m i tomorrow .
The day before yesterday was an In d i an f est i v al .
C o m p ar ed to In d i an , I became a mi n or ity .
The temple ' s look / str u c ture is very ma j est ic and sp e c ta c ul ar .
N ever th e less , the next even t was b or ing .
I sp ent 5 do ll ar s to get the entrance ti c ke t but I only stay ed for about 3 0 mi n s .
This is because my friend want ed to leave .
I was kind of in bad mo o d .
If he had , we would n ' t have pai d for it .
I thought it would be too t ough for me to understand mo v ies in English .
, so we follow ed his propos al .
A l th ough he is a n ic e guy , he is suppose d to ch er ish money and sp ent it in s m ar t me th o d .
I le ar n t the w or d ' ' sub m it ' '
I ' ll us e it in some ex amp le s .
I ( already ) sub m it ted my re s um e to the comp an y which I want to work for .
I ' ll sub m it some do c u ment s to the e m b as s y for get ting a V I S A .
I have to sub m it my home w or k to school .
I ( have ) got a co l d . . .
- The s i z e of his house ga ve me a sh ock .
- As far as I know , most K or e an and J a p an e se people know what the `` g en er al character of each b l o o d ty pe `` is and I think they take it s sign if ic ance serious ly .
I do n ' t know if other s , who are not k or e an or j a p an e se , know it or not .
- I have heard about `` z o d i a c sign s `` and I think it is similar to how `` the g en er al character of each b l o o d ty pe `` works .
My sign is L e o and it say s L e o people are bra ve and act ive .
I usual ly take the se things just for f un , but some time s they are re ally right about me .
I us ed to be surprise d about this but now I think it is not that big a de al .
Well , it could be just because there is a co in c id ence .
A n y way , I enjoy c ar t o on s on the g en er al character of each b l o o d ty pe .
My b l o o d ty pe is B and it is de s c ri b ed as `` B ty pe people are op t im is t ic but c a p ri c i ous . ``
And they ten d to speak out .
It look s like a per f e c t ma t ch for the i P ad .
You can in s er t the i p ad ho ri z on t ally into the s l ot while with the off ic i al a p p le i p ad ke y b o ar d only can do it in ver t ical way !
And when you finish us ing , co ver your i p ad to the ke y b o ar d , it turn s your i p ad to an a p p le not e p ad im m ed i ate ly !
u h h h , I might be able to get it from some e - co m m er ce we b s ite s here which im p or ted it in an un o f f ic i al way , but I do n ' t want take ri s k because ke y b o ar d s are just a f r a g i le to y
I have a little question .
A re there some r ul es when I write `` S in ce `` or `` As `` on the begin n ing of a sen t ence ?
I re g is ter ed on L an g - 8 to day .
I study English ma in ly .
In addition , I also study S p an ish a little .
I ' d like to co m m un ic ate with the English - speak ing us er s and start to study English right now .
P le a se friend me .
E a ch is we l c ome ! !
So do n ' t he s it ate to con ta c t with me .
T h an k you for read ing my di ar y .
S in ce re ly your s . . .
I ' m G o ing To G o To C o st c o
I ' m going to go to C o st c o .
It is an A m er ic an st or e .
I was told th at there are a l ot of big c a ke s and b a g s with many c a ke s th at I c a n ' t eat alone for se ve n days .
I have not been there before .
I will bu y m u f f in s and p a el la for l un ch with my family .
H a ve you ever go ne to C o st c o ?
What do you re c o m m en d ?
I have to re p or t my as s i g n ment by We d ne s day , but there ' s something wrong with my comp ut er .
I don t ' know how to so l ve it .
I tri ed in va in to so l ve it for about 2 days .
A l th ough my ma j or is C o m p ut er S c i ence , I see m to be comp ut er i ll it er ate .
It w o n ' t be a pro ble m , if the as s i g n ment is a person al ta s k .
However , it must be done with a gr o up .
D a m n it ! O r : D a m m it !
I ' m under str es s .
O h my go d , to day is very hot . In the morning , I want to school but s un is so hot . In the after no on I must go s w im m ing
P le a se do n ' t change all of the sen t ence into new sen t ence s . . .
so the time was not c he c k ed .
We ar ri v ed at about 8 o ' clock .
about 1 0 clock , d y n a m o re a ch ed and 1 hour la ter , In s ul ting done . ( ? ? ? )
so we play ed with a c at , the fact or y pe t , for about 3 hour s .
There was no over time work
On ro ad of back to the home ,
But another thing was well
The f a ir way of the ho le they were play ing was next to the ro ad .
When the first man began to s w ing , a he ar se came along the ro ad , he stop p ed and face d the f un er al pro ce s s ion for a while , and when the he ar se pass ed by , he b ow ed his head in p r a y er .
When they were walk ing to the gr e en , the second man said , `` That was a to u ch ing show of respect for / to ( they both work ) the de ce as ed / de ad back there .
I had no idea / did n ' t re al i z e ( again , both work well ) you were so sen t i ment al . ``
The first man sh r u g g ed and said , `` it was the least I could do .
If you want to read the C h in e se ver s ion , please c l ic k the l in k be l ow ; )
T h ough some people believe a consider able pro p or tion of r ur al students would put great effort into le ar n ing , it is man if est that there re ally is a p h en ome n on that r ur al students are more pro ne to have difficult y ent er ing un ive r s ity .
In my opinion , un ive r s it ies should re n d er the se students as s is t ance give n the re al ity of the di f f er ence s between different are as .
Even though , I have to e m p ha s i z e the fact that it is co m m on ly believe d to day that r ur al students have been dis p ri v il ed g ed from their in f an c y on w ar d .
I made friend s
I play ed a l ot w i th my friend s every day : )
Well . . .
That w as what I p ic k ed up .
But now w e are friend s .
He could speak English , F re n ch and A r a b ic .
H is friend s could s pe a k J a p an e se and some other language s .
and I answered `` Y E S `` .
In s te ad , he t aught me English .
A l s o , I did not ( = did n ' t ) know that F re n ch is spoke n in A r a b i a .
I ' m a little interest ed in F re n ch .
I want to make many friend s from many different c o un t ri es !
She will leave home and stay the who le day in kind er g ar ten .
W h i ch things should we p re p ar e ?
When I was a kid , I stay ed at my gr and p a and gr and m a ' s house every month .
I always took a bath with my gr and p a and s l ept next to him .
A fter bath ing , he always took his too th out of his mouth .
O f course , he had a full de n ture and I did n ' t .
I told my mother about this after I gr e w up , she laugh ed .
I ' m going to finish this da ir y with a f e w w or d s here before going to be d , to express my feel ing s about after watch ing the 1 0 th C h in e se B ri d g e comp e t i tion .
A t this moment , I know that nothing is im po s s i ble to man age when you e ng age in it with your who le heart and with your full effort . ( M or e natural English )

And to day I went to a b ri e f ing s es s ion about a g l o b al work ing pro g r a m at my comp an y .
There I found out the require ment s for going a b ro ad are so hard and I c a n ' t me e t the them .
A t the same time , I got the T O E I C re s ul t which I took one month a g o .
The s c or e was l ow er than I had expect ed , so I am so o o o sh ock ed .
A n y way , I want to be a co ll e g e st ud ent .
And If I am a co ll e g e st ud ent , I will go a b ro ad to study .
Where is it good to go to become s k il led in English ?
He us ed to do the c ook ing ,
I de c id ed to study S p an ish yesterday al th ough I ' m not good at English e i ther .
I heard that S p an ish is de s c en d ed from L at in like English .
If I study S p an ish , study ing English I will give me good re s ul t s
I know ( / knew ) a man who can ( / could ) speak many other language s
and I have been read ing ar t ic le s on his b l o g .
so I ( have ) de c id ed to study S p an ish too .
I went to the l i b r ar y to b or r ow a S p an ish b ook to day .

I will study S p an ish for 3 0 minute s every day ,

To tell the tru th , I went to V i en n a for a school tri p last s um m er and saw some of O t t o W a g n er ' s bu il d ing s .
E s pe c i ally , I like d the po st office .
This po st office , the S aving s B an k , is one of the W or l d He ri t age sit es in V i en n a .
This bu il d ing was de s i g n ed with al um in i um and g la s s .
In those days , the se ma ter i al s were ra re ly us ed .
That ' s why O t t o W a g n er was called one of the great p ion e er s of mo d er n is t ar ch ite c ture .
To day is the f in al day in G W ( G o l d en We e k ) which mean s long ho l i day s .
I do n ' t w an n a work any m or e . . .
but I have to make a living . . .
This is en c o ur a g ing for us . ( an en c o ur age ment )
We con t in u e to p r a c t ic e for the next conc er t at the same place .
I was b or n and raise d in J a p an .
I study English by myself .
I work as a ha ir s ty l is t and make up ar t is t .
I l o ve this job .
My dr e a m is to have my own sh op .
That is why I want to study a b ro ad .
P e op le living near my house of ten give my family ve g e t able s such as to m at o es and c u c um b er s in the s um m er .
So , I eat to m at o es day after day in s um m er .
people who give ve g e t able s like p l ant ing them .
I think that the old people like p l ant ing ve g e t able s better than the you ng people in J a p an .
I ' m study ing English and C h in e se .
They are both difficult .
V is it ing K y ot o
I had live d in K y ot o when I was a un ive r s ity st ud ent .
I went to K y ot o with my w if e and so n .
I live in S h i g a next to K y ot o .
The tri p took about thirty minute s by c ar .
I b ough t some it e m s such as a p en case , a P o st - it , e t c . , with my so n while my w if e had S h i at s u , a kind of body ma s s age s in J a p an .
I us ed a s ling that help s c ar ry my so n .
It might see m to be I k um en . We us ed that to mean a man who ch il d c ar e hard in J a p an re c ent ly .
As id e from work ing on the ta s k my p rofessor as s i g n ed to me , I ' ve been bu s y job - hu n ting on the In ter ne t this week .
I have only at ten d ed two job in ter v i e w s unti l now .
I did n ' t have any ex pe ri ence do ing the ta s k s require d of the position .
Well , I gue s s because it was a p ri v ate comp an y and one of the two in ter v i e w er s was the C E O , so he asked what ever he want ed to know for it was H I S comp an y .
B e c a us e he was writing things down , I did n ' t like it .
The g en er al man age r said a l ot to me about her two over se as m aster s ' de g re e , her work ing at t it ud e and high stand ar d on can d id ate s , and so on .
She said she was a work a h o l ic who works 1 4 hour s every day .
She was very pro ud that she work ed 6 year s in C h in a , and then went a b ro ad to work and got her de g re es at the same time .
That was un im a g in able .
She asked about my salary expect ation and how I could think I w or th that much money .
It was a t ough question , es pe c i ally when she asked it in an a g g re s s ive way .
She said my expect ation could be re a ch ed after I work for 2 or 3 year s and I have to work from the most b as ic position .
The pro ble m was that my expect ed salary was the co m m on stand ar d in gradua te s .
A t last , the s al es man age r told me to call her tomorrow if I de c id ed to accept the job .
S in ce I go to a re m o te place I have not been before this is a good ex er c is e .
It does not co st us a l ot of money to go c y c ling .
I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent , and ma j or ing in J a p an e se litera ture .
I es pe c i ally le ar n about mo d er n no ve l s and C h ri st i an write r s ' no ve l s in J a p an .
I ' m not good at anything at all , but please be kind to me .
But I have a l ot of home w or k still .
I want to go to be d as e ar ly as possible ! !
B e ing a un ive r s ity st ud ent is very hard .
S t ud y a b ro ad is ne ce s s ar y to speak a for e i g n language s k i ll ful ly ? ?
What do you think ? ?
The ex a m is he l d only once a year .
The year before last and last year I pass ed the first t est but f a il ed the second t est .
I ho pe to pass the second t est this year .
The re s ul t s will be an no un c ed the end ( ? ) of this month .
What are you do ing for N e w Y e ar s ?
To day is the last day of No ve m b er , and 2 0 1 0 will end soon .
My family is going on a tri p d ur ing the N e w Y e ar ho l i day , but we have not de c id ed where to go .
To day I will find some place s and make re s er v ation s for them .
D o you have any re c o m m en d ation s ?
What are you do ing for N e w Y e ar s ?
I re g is ter ed an account on this sit e to day .
I de c id ed on writing 3 time s in a week .
However , my w if e asked me to have l un ch with her after my sh op p ing .
I had no idea what to have for l un ch with my w if e d ur ing a week day .
E ver y day , I am work ing for a comp an y , and my w if e is ma in tain ing our house .
B as ic ally , it is im po s s i ble to have a l un ch with her usual ly .
However , it was possible if I could take a half day off .
This idea has never o c c ur r ed to me before .
We went to the w in e sh op first , and then we had a good l un ch at an old J a p an e se re st a ur ant .
B y the way , I had to bu y some w in e to day for my friend .
He invite d me to the even t .
In s te ad , I will give him some w in e to express my than k s to him .
B y the way , it will be ho l i day tomorrow ( is about to ent er the morning of To m or r ow now . . . ) in J a p an .
A place to live
I have some ch o ic es : stay ing in the do r m , find ing a ho st family , or stay ing with friend s .
It depend s on when and how I have to go up to M in ne s ot a .
I ' m p l an n ing on tak ing the G re y h ound .
I ' ve got ta mo ve quick ly .
It ' s the middle of the se m est er , but I ' m both er ed about what will happen after .
It ' s M on day !
We e k en d has go ne and M on day has come !
Yes ter day I made new friend s at L an g - 8 and I got my first c or re ction on my ent ry ~
T h an k you for the c or re ction s T ur ku a se .
E ver y M on day d ur ing this se m est er , I have only one class so I do n ' t feel like a b ur d en d ur ing the week en d s .
I could n ' t read my ma j or b ook s well and also could n ' t conc ent r ate well .
I think I should n ' t ha ng out too much d ur ing the week en d s or it will be hard for me to start a new week .
O M G , To m or r ow I have five class es , 3 of them are my ma j or class es .
I had to c le an my room before C h in e se new year .
When I w o ke up and went to work ,
I saw S ar u was on line in st ic k a m .
I was look ing for a good we b s ite for c or re c ting my English , and I found out about this co o l one .
I l o ve le ar n ing English and have been study ing through am er ic an show , mo v ies , and p op m us ic .
I also have a p l an to le ar n another language like J a p an e se that I tired to study in high school or G er man .
I would be very ha p p y if I could help you with your writing , w it ten in k or e an .
I ' m coming home to day from a E ur o pe tri p that last ed a month .
It was very ex c it ing , im p or t ant , ha p p y , and pe a ce ful for me .
I ' ll never for g e t it for ever !
I de c id e to write my p re c i ous me m or y about this day in English .
I ' m not good at English .
But I ' ll try !
B e c a us e ,
English is very im p or t ant co m m un ic ation too l for talk ing to each other .
He is a f a m ous J a p an e se m us ic i an and a g u it ar is t .
H is so ng s make me , and other his f an s C o - M i y a v i , very ha p p y .
He is going to A m er ic a to hold some conc er t s .
I l o ve `` P op is D e ad . `` It is the be st .
P le a se c he c k his so ng s out on the In ter ne t ! ! ! !
I ' m in my gr and p ar ent ' s house and stay there for 4 days long .
A fter that , we had a bu f f e t .
We also see a l ot of c ook ing over there as well as in the bath .
of course there are a l ot of other me n u ( ch o ic es ) ! !
However my gr and p ar ent were n ' t s u f f ic i ent : - ( O R [ was n l t enough ]
D o you know what is the reason ? ?
How do ( did ) you sp en d to day ?
I re c c ome n d it .
R e c ent ly I think H i ro M i z us h im a is most beautiful person .
When he was act or , he is very . act ive
He appeared on va ri ous T V show s , mo v i e and C M .
I was sure to watch his T V show and so on .
S in ce at that time , I respect him .
H is first b ook is p ur s u ed good re s ul t .
I think that his ability and effort is en or m ous .
One day , I looked de e p inside the b ow l and I watch ed him for a while .
H is mouth always mo ve s .
Why do n ' t you get me a big g er tank with more fish in it ?
I put some p l ant s in the bo t t o m of the tank ,
So , I went to the pe t st or e again and b ough t three more go l d f ish .
H a p p y to be here .
So , I of ten make f o o d for my friend s and p ar ent s .
F or t un ate ly , one of my be st friend s re ally like s that I make ch o c o - b r ow n ies .
And some time s , when I want to make different c a ke s or p ies , I usual ly s ur f the we b .
Then , I can find a l ot of re c i pe for that .
6 year s a g o , I ra n her over with my c ar at an in ter se ction in S h i b u y a , one of the big g est c it ies in Tokyo .
F or t un ate ly , she only b ro ke her hi p j o in t and s u f f er s from no after effect even now .
She was just about 2 - month - old all e y c at then .
A t that time , I was head ing for the live house where my b and had in ten d ed to give a r ock conc er t that night . However , I could n ' t make it on time for our re he ar s al .
One of my b and me m b er s follow ed me to the ve ter in ar y ho s p it al after the conc er t .
He is in N Y C now and make s a living by play ing the s a x .
I study English . ( ^ . ^ )
I start study ing E ng I ish to day .
I like a l ot of ho b b ies .
My family con s is t s of my hu s b and and I .
E ver y day we enjoy life .
When you ' re having a good time with your friend , you ' re having f un
When you are do ing something y o u like , it is f un .
Some th ing that is funny will make you laugh . A j o ke can be funny or mo v i e can also be funny .
My friend A ll en is very a funny person , he make s us all laugh .
I ' m not sure if it works but I re ally want n at ive speak er s to point out which w or d s I do n ' t pro no un ce c or re c t ly .
I am writing this di ar y while dr in k ing a can of `` high b a ll `` .
It has too much l i qu or in it for me .
To day I work ed over time so I asked my w if e and so n to go to her p ar ent s house .
No w I am alone at home .
C o ul d you c he c k my follow ing s el f - in t ro d u ction ?
It ' s my first time to see him and the first op p or t un ity to de ve l op my English ability as an in ter n ation al and business L an g u age .
P le a se call me R i y e for short .
I am work for A B C comp an y in J a p an .
I have been work ing as a s y s te m p l an n er in the I T de v is ion for 1 year as of this J un e .
But before this position , I was th e I T con s ul t ant for 5 year s , so I am e v ry f a m il i ar with this comp an y .
The re c ent t re n d at my comp an y is : `` O ur comp an y will take the c ust ome r ex pe ri ence to the next le ve l us ing di g it al te ch no l o g y . ``
F or many year s , since we ' ve been us ing i nformation te ch no l o g y as a business too l , the comp an y has put money into the co st - s aving do m a in .
F in ance , P ur ch as ing , S al es A d m in is t r ation are the most im p or t ant do m a in s and have e c on o m ic effect s for / in I T in ve st ment .
But now is the time to us e I T for de ve l op ing a close d l o op re l ation s h i p between our st or es and the c ust ome r .
We as s y s te m p l an n n er s must think to e m b r ance so c i al and di g it al me d i a and con t in u e to look for new way s to b ri d g e the co m f or t able ex pe ri ence at st or es with the di g it al world .
I would like to dis c us s with the c ent r al office me m b er s about my idea s de ta il ed a b o ve .
This is one of the most im p or t ant reason s why I want to study e ng l ish .
A n y way I ho pe I can have a good re l ation s h i p with you .
in a w ar m S p r ing light
I ' m writing a j o ur n al ent ry for to day ' s class , and I know there are some gra m m at ical er r or s ,
but , I don t know how I ' m suppose d to c or re c t them .
F ir st of all , as I am J a p an e se , I am glad to study this to p ic ; the n u c le ar bo m b .
T h r ough o ut the ro ad b a c k ( ? ) from H i ro s h im a , I found that then u c le ar bo m b g en er ate s nothing re ally , not e ve n so r r ow , l on el i ness and s ad ness .
F or in st ance , in the last part of `` A W h ite B l ous e `` , it say s `` there was n ' t a s ing le so ul on the p l at f or m . `` It v i v id ly c re ate s an at m o s p he re of nothing , because the a u th or say s a s ing le `` so ul `` did not ex is t in s te ad of saying a s ing le person
A fter that , it say s `` but their hu n d r ed s of sh o es , left and right se p ar at ed one from the other `` S h o es , c l o g s , s and al s and s l i p p er s re p re s ent the e v id ence that hu man life w as there .
act u ally , this is my second writing da i ly ,
The first one was go ne > < .
any way I went to the mo un tain which is f a m ous for r ock c l im b ing a week a g o .
we are only a begin n er so we us ed a ro pe way from the start ing place c ir c a 7 0 0 m to 1 5 0 0 - ish m on one .
Then , we took the l if t to go to the high er place !
The view was so n ic e
I was re ally sat is f i ed and does n ' t want to con t in u e further .
however we could n ' t go back so soon . There f or e , we con t in u e c l im b ing to the to p of the mo un tain ! ! ! !
we are feel ing ha p p y at first , but the high er we re a ch I got difficult ies in b re a th ing > < .
I thought this was a sign of al t it ud e sick ness .
F in ally , we ar ri v ed at the to p ! ! !
It was am a z ing and a w es ome ! ! ! ! ! ! !

B e c a us e I am a little w or ri ed that they can not comp le te ly understand my suggest ion s in C h in e se , and I c a n ' t speak K or e an and J a p an e se .
Yes ter day a friend of mi ne told me that I must sub m it a paper to get a s ch o l ar s h i p of 2 0 1 0 .
I was surprise d because I have never heard that from the un i v .
If I do n ' t not sub m it a paper , I can not receiv e s ch o l ar s h i p . . . . .
In J a p an , n ation al un ive r s it ies have more money than p ri v ate one s ; which di f f er s from the one s in the U S A .
( Tokyo has some ma j or p ri v ate one s : W as ed a , K e i o u , e t c .
D ur ing the next two days , in J a p an , N ation al C ent er T est for U n ive r s ity A d mission s is he l d .
This is e qu i v al ent to the S A T in the U S A .

It was very long ter m ex a m s ; we must have had 7 t est s !
I never want to take it again .
I c ook ed c ur ry with a p re s s ur e c ook er at last night .
The be e f in the c ur ry was so tender !
T h an k s to the p re s s ur e c ook er !
My dr e a m is tra ve ling to many co un t ri es .
In J a p an , the ch er ry b l o s s o m s begin to b l o o m ! !
I wish I had friend s
I ' ve st ud i ed English for s ever al year s .
but I ' ve only f o c us ed on read ing and listen ing .
for that reason I ' m not good at speak ing and writing .
how can I im p ro ve my speak ing and writing s k i ll s ?
U n f or t un ate ly I have no ch ance to talk in English .
I ho pe I can have some language ex change friend s .
A ll second gra d e students in my school have been to O k in a w a on a school tri p for three days !
F or ex amp le , we le ar n ed about the `` B at t le of O k in a w a ( A p ri l , 1 94 5 ) `` , which happen ed d ur ing W W I I , by visit ing O k in a w a .
We went to a bo m b she l ter and listen ed some st or ies from O k in a w a people and visit ed the m us e um .
G ir l s around my age ( 1 3 - 1 8 year s old students ) were for c ed to work as n ur se s for in j ur ed so l d i er s in law less are as .
M o st girl s also di ed .
I think we have to re m e m b er such a s ad story and do something for pe a ce .
O f course , we also enjoy ed play ing in the `` s um m er re s or t `` of O k in a w a for other two days ! ! ! ! ! !
We stay ed at the hotel which was bu il t near the E a st C h in a S e a . I enjoy ed see ing it , going for walk s , having very de l ic i ous dinner and b re a k f a st and talk ing with my friend s unti l mi d night !
I went to one of the most f a m ous a qu ar i um s in the world , a beautiful sea p ar k and the c a st le in f l u ence d by both C h in a and J a p an a u th or i z ed as a world her it age bu il d ing and so on .
It was very great f un ! ! ! !
. . . I do n ' t want to study for middle ter m ex a m s which will begin next F ri day : ' (
I enjoy ed di v ing .
I b ough t them C o ke of than k s .
I could have not po st ent ri es re c ent ly because I had a l ot of things to do and the hard s ch ed ul e made me have a head a ch e .
To day , I have not got l ot s of things , so I can write and I ' m a little b it ha p p y : D
Well , I am w or ri ed about the N e w Z e al and E ar th qu a ke .
It str u c k serious ly off the so u th of the l and .
A new s p a p er also said that it was ma g n it ud e 7 .
J a p an of ten has e ar th qu a ke s , though I have never ex pe ri ence d such a ho r ri ble one .
I ho pe all of you have not been affect ed by this e ar th qu a ke at all .
J a p an has many e ar th qu a ke s every where .
A ccord ing to off ic i al i nformation , Tokyo will be having a big e ar th qu a ke
R e c ent ly I started to p re p ar e e v a c u ation e qu i p ment , f o o d , to w el s , to i le t ri es
To day I receiv ed water from a ma il or d er comp an y .
As it ' s a big v o l um e ( 3 0 can s ) ,
it ' s difficult for me to find st or age sp a ce .
To day , I j o in ed L an g - 8 .
In my opinion , this sit e is re ally great to le ar n a second language .
I ho pe you will help me le ar n English .
S in ce I had to get up at 5 am on the four th of No ve m b er , and I was too sleep y last night , I w o ke up at 1 am on No v . f if th . There you go !
I pass ed the t est , o h y e a h ! C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S !
I will get my dr ive r ' s l ic en se after three week s .
The answer to R A V I ' s question of why we became te m p er a ment al in the meeting is because we are not l o c al people here , we are high s ch o o l class m ate s , and went to different co ll e g es in different c it ies far away from each other .
F in ally we got to g e ther and ( now ) work in the same c ity , the most e c on o m ic ally a d v ance d c ity in ma in l and ch in a , our home t ow n is 3 th ous and s mi le s from here , and it take s 4 hour s by f light .
We have a meeting every two month s because we are bu s y work ing usual ly .
On the other side , you know , as i an s are little con s er v at ive some time s , they con t ro l their e m o tion s , but if something s ad were to happen , they go out of con t ro l , and become te m p er a ment al .
It ' s ( both ) no m al and a b n or m al to you ,
I ' ve up d at ed the E m a il S y s te m to day , L O L , I ' ll be bu s i er tomorrow .
I have many things to say , but I ' m sleep y now , and it ' s too l ate .
This is my first time us ing this sit e .
If you can find any mistake s in my di ar y , please in d ic ate .
Yes ter day , I st ud i ed English to pass the ex a m .
This month there is T O E F L t est .
N ic e to me e t you every on e : )
I ' m G a y o un g ,
But my for e i g n friend s call me R i y a .
I was give n this name by my In d i an friend : )
I ' m so ha p p y to me e t people from other co un t ri es and le ar n their c ust o m s .
The reason why I am le ar n ing English is to be able to tra ve l and me e t many people .
I believe that / that ' s how I feel
I am so tired , I want to go to sleep . . .
I am a st ud ent . I do not study hard but I like study ing . . .
I like play ing b as ke t b a ll and ex er c is ing .
I always go ex er c is ing with my friend s .
I think I can be a good st ud ent .
I ' ve sp ent much time alone to day , because my w if e went to her friend ' s w ed d ing part y yesterday .
When I got up at 6 : 3 0 , I c le an ed up the living room and ( one of the ) be d room s .
I did two round s of la un d ry , as there are many c l o th es which my w if e and I w or e in the b as ke t .
Then I went to the ha ir s al on to have my ha ir c ut , so I could feel co m f or t able .
A fter she return s , we are going to have dinner to g e ther .
I took my b a b y to see my in - law s this morning .
I some time s feel a little b it g u il ty about that .
To day I had no p l an s , and my b a b y want ed to go out , so f in ally I de c id ed to visit them .
But , something bad happen ed after tak ing my b a b y to a p ar k with my mother - in - law .
On the way back from the p ar k to their house , my mother - in - law d ropped by her ne i g h b or ' s and started y a p p ing .
I know she re ally like s talk ing , and she was re ally ha p p y to show her gr and k id to her ne i g h b or s .
A t last , I got tired of wait ing for her to finish talk ing .
She prefer s being alone to as s o c i at ing with ne i g h b or s .
So , that was a sh ock !
I think people had better not dr in k too much like in this picture .
To day I went to my un ive r s ity , and at ten d ed the G er man class .
A fter study ing , I had a meeting for the sh o d o c l u b .
My ho b b i e is o il pai n ting .
I took a ar t history class .
That was f un .
I w o ke up at 6 : 0 0 A M , but I f e ll as le e p again .
But such a thing did n ' t come off to day .
My hard effort is require d now ! !
I study J a p an e se at J P I st ance for J a p an P h il .
I did n ' t write a di ar y for long , long time . . .
M a y b e for around 1 y e ar !
A n y way , I went to In d i a and I was stay ing there from D e ce m b er 2 0 1 0 to M ar ch 2 0 1 1 .
To be honest , around 4 year s a g o , when I s u f f er ed v s ome kind of un t re at able dis e a se , I thought that I never go to In d i a again .
B e c a us e that dis e a se at ta c k s the st o m a ch .
And there was many difficult sit u ation s for me .
I re ally felt s ad and ho pe less .
But d ur ing s ever al year s , I could n ' t give up on that .
But In d i a has strong , at t r a c t ive people and is a place with many ex pe ri ence s and view s .
And also , In d i a always give s me a strong v it al ity .
That is why I could n ' t give up on that .
I re ally a p p re c i ate that .
F e b r u ar y is a gradua tion sea s on .
A l s o , they str i p the gradua te s and th r ow them into the sea .
As I see it , this is e m b ar r as s ing .
I am poor ,
but I want to ful f i ll my se x u al de s ir es .
What should I do to sat is f y the se con t r ad ic t or y two things ?
I may los e my life .
I wonder if I should take the ri s k .
tri p ( V i e t n a m , G u a m )
D o you all go on tri p s f re qu ent ly ?
I of ten go on tri p s .
I have been to V i e t n a m and G u a m as far as for e i g n co un t ri es .
I went to the g ul f of the world her it age in H an on , V i e t n a m .
It was my s ter i ous and I was impress ed .
T h ough I want ed to go s w im in the c le an sea ; I could n ' t , so I was very s ad .
However , I went di v ing , and I was impress ed by the beautiful fish .
They were both sp le n d id place s .
I re c o m m en d the se place s for va c ation s .
E as y to p r a c t ic e con ver s ation .
I s it n ic e in Tokyo ?
It ' s s um m er in A ust r al i a now .
It ' s dark in the room .
It ' s w ar m here .
It ' s dinner time .
It ' s not very w ar m in his room .
R e c ent ly I read a b ook , <TheUpsideofIrrationality> .
It ' s a re ally interest ing b ook which is re le v ant to our da i ly work and st ud ies .
The write r us es an understand able way to i ll ust r ate some e c on o m ic the or ies .
However , the night is too l ate now .
T h an k you sen d ing me the m us ic .
But I could not he ar it .
I will listen to it when I go home .
D o you know L ad y G a G a ?
R e c ent ly , I ' m interest ed in be a ut y , because my friend go es to
be a ut y school and she always tell s me about co s m etic s , ha ir , and so on .
I went to the be a ut y s al on at my friend ' s school .
I got her to give me a sha m po o and a blow - dr y ! !
I also got her to do my make up ! !
My friend told me that co s m etic s were so c he a p in K or e a ! !
So now I want to go there and bu y a l ot of bra n d name good s ,
for ex amp le , M A C , L un as o l , R M K , and so on .
A l th ough I live alone , when ever I open the va c u um b a g after a per i o d of time , I ( always ) see so much d ust inside .
I wonder where all this d ust come s from ?
There is something wrong with my P C
My P C does not bo ot c or re c t ly for some time now .
I usual ly push the re se t but t on each time when I bo ot my P C .
To day , the sound s con ne c ting the P C to another de v ic e r ing s ud d en ly .
I became afraid im m ed i ate ly .
D o es my machi ne con tain any comp ut er v ir us ?
O r simpl y the hard dis c might have been b ro k en ?
A c t u ally , it is the first time for me to in st a ll it on my P C .
I have been us ing this P C since 2 0 0 4 .
My heart is p ound ing .
A f in an c i al c ri s is is coming . As a C h in e se , I have an op p or t un ity as well as a cha ll e ng e . In my opinion our country has the ch ance to im p ro ve it s n ation al str e ng th . However , we also have the str es s on our e c on o m y .
She was a ma g ical girl .
She is go ne .
She was k il led by w it ch who ' s name d `` C h ar l ot te `` .
She f ough t to g u ar d her friend s , but C h ar l ot te was very strong .
In it i ally , I thought that she was a w i re - p u ll er .
But I was mistake n .
She was not a w i re - p u ll er .
M an y people were s ad about her de a th .
If a w i re - p u ll er does ex is t , it is for good those who w ro te this st up id s c en ar i o , and us who ho p ed for this st up id s c en ar i o .
G o d sp e ed M a m i .
I de c id ed to write an English b l o g start ing to day .
It will probab ly be very hard for me because I ' m la z y and I get b or ed easily .
I ' d l o ve n at ive English speak er s to help me .
O f course I can help your J a p an e se le ar n ing ( too ) .
The ti t le of the D V D is `` G h o st `` .
I had watch ed for more than 3 time s .
She can see the g h o st and talk s to him .
The mo v i e was good for me .
I want to see `` A v at ar `` and `` A l ic e `` some day .
H ad you watch the se mo v ies or D V D s ?
I am ha p p y to day because my c l u b meeting was c ance ll ed .
The c l u b act i v it ies make me tired ! !
We must think about having a good time for we l c o m ing c l u b me m b er s next year and so on .
this is because the me m b er s are very kind and I like do ing call i g r a p h y .
When I w o ke up , s n ow p il ed up th ic k ly on the gr ound .
So I went to work by tax i .
L at er , I sh o ve led the s n ow with my co ll e a gue .
While I did , J un - s i k th re w s n ow b a ll s .
The s n ow b a ll s hi t my body .
I tri ed to get re ve ng e on J un - s i k , but I f a il ed .
He a v o id ed me f a st .
My feet are co l d .
To m or r ow , the s n ow w o n ' t f a ll .
P o st c ar d s which I had written to my family from S ing a po re ar ri v ed yesterday .
I had kept it a se c re t , so my family was surprise d and please d .
I think it is a good idea to write po st c ar d s from the place s we go .
I went to Ka w a g o e c ity by b i ke with my w if e and my f re n d s .
We p l an n ed to get to g e ther at 1 1 a . m . , but my f re n d s came at no on .
It was very de l ic i ous .
This c ity has re m a in ed old house s along the street .
We were home at 6 p . m . .
My w if e was very tired , so she went to be d e ar ly .
I enjoy sp e ed - so l v ing the R u b i k ' s C u b e .
I ' ve been play 2 * 2 , 3 * 3 and 4 * 4 . I want to bu y a 7 * 7 , so may b e my friend and I will go to sh op p ing and bu y a 7 * 7 R u b i k ' s C u b e .
The follow ing we b s ite has a s im ul at or . It ' s very co o l .
The follow ing we b s ite has a free s im ul ation so f t w ar e .
This is a simple s im ul at or to give us some for m ul as .
If you do n ' t have a comp ut er , but you have a mo b i le , you can us e the s im ul at or provide d by the follow ing we b s ite .
He ll o ~ ~ E ver y body ! ! I ' m a new c ome r in la ng 8 .
L i v ing in S e o ul for 2 3 year s .
c ur r ent ly s er v ing in G un s an 3 8 th fight er ' s W ing as an first class a ir m en .
very interest ing in le ar n ing how to speak f l u ent ly and write proper in English .
My re c ent ho b b y is pai n ting .
I like pai n ting picture s .
The day before , I b ough t some draw ing paper , pai n ting b r us he s and water - co l or pai n t .
When I pai n t a picture , I can f o c us and de v o te myself who le s ome ly into pai n ting the picture .
My hu s b and ' s friend sen t us a ( bo x of ? ) c re a m c he e se and str a w b er ry c a ke .
It was from the f a m ous c a ke sh op in H o k k a id o , which is l o c at ed in the no r th part of J a p an .
The sh op is f a m ous for c he e se c a ke s .
They o c c as ion ally run te m p or ar y sh op s in the de p ar t ment st or es in Tokyo , but we c a n ' t usual ly bu y it in Tokyo .
That ' s why it is va l u able . However , my d aught er s do n ' t like c a ke s and my hu s b and does n ' t like c a ke s with a str a w b er ry f la v or .
We took the less on this morning .
It was a two - story c a ke .
One was a c re a m c he e se la y er which was he a v y , and the other was a str a w b er ry la y er which was sweet and so ur .
S t ud y ing is hard when you have to for ce your s el f .
When you ha te do ing something , you just stop do ing it .
That ' s why you have to or g an i z e your work so it will be co m f or t able for you .
I have tri ed many way s to study English .
I have read te x t b ook s , which was us e ful but b or ing .
I have le ar n ed un k n ow n w or d s from a di ction ar y , which was d u ll .
I then tri ed some more things unti l I re al i z ed that I like read ing b ook s the most .
I le ar n them and then th r ow the she e t away .
If I for g e t a w or d , I write it down and le ar n it again .
I think too much i nformation does n ' t help .
I went out dr i v ing with my s is ter to day ,
I de c id ed to make a ne c k la ce us ing p ow er stone s .
I us ed some stone s which have a he al ing p ow er .
The de s s er t I had was so good ! !
I think the b re ad and mi l k in the U K might be more de l ic i ous than those in J a p an .
So , F r ance is probab ly a very n ic e country in terms of b re ad .
To day , I my girl friend and I b ro ke up .
It ' s because she has an im p or t ant dr e a m .
It is hard for her because she has to e ar n a l ot of money and has to study hard er and hard er .
we talk ed about the se dr e a m s with each other .
We agree d it ' s be st for us to b re a k up and conc ent r ate on our dr e a m s .
So we de c id ed to part from each other .
B e f or e get to the train , I am not s ad because I can not re ally believe it .
A fter get back home , I am so s ad because I not ic e she does n ' t call , sen d E - ma il , talk by s k y pe any m or e .
I he s it ate whether dis po se of her present to me , a ke y hold er , or not .
No w I can we b s ur f with this p h on e which is what I ' ve want ed the most .
But I ' m not a c c ust ome d to yet , so I only know a f e w f un ction s .
Some th ing that I feel un c o m f or t able with is writing J a p an e se .
I found an a p p l ic ation that make s it possible , but even so , writing J a p an e se is still not easy .
I can not make c or re ction s through the p h on e but I can leave a commen t .
I c aught a co l d and have a run n y no se .
B e c a us e it was ra in ing so hard there was s ome trouble get ting to the se p ul ch er .
The ra in stop p ed but it ' s still so ch il ly here .
No w I have to go visit my un c le s .
To m or r ow is a ho l i day ! !
But when to m m or r ow is go ne , I ' m go n n a start a hard s ch ed ul e !
D o n ' t give up ! !
R e - start ing Y o g a
L a st year , I us ed to do y o g a every morning and every night for about three month s .
I ha e a y o g a v id e o ( ? ) f i le on my la p t op .
This v id e o ( or : It ) take s about 4 5 minute s .
A fter finish ing it , you will be s w e at ing ( ? ) all over and feel re fresh ed .
I re ally want to get back to the sha pe I us ed to be in just half a year a g o .
The se f e w week s have been he ll , re ally !
I was p un ish ed by my ever so strong in c l in ation to pro c r a st in ate and pro c r a st in ate .
So the es s a y s and b ook s to read p il ed up unti l I had a to - do p i le of paper w or k the s i z e of a s k y s c r a p er ^ ^ ; The re s ul t was me read ing b ook s the night before my litera ture or al ex a m , he he ^ ^ ;
So I st ock ed up on some ch o c o l ate and other stuff you w o n ' t know how many c al or ies they con tain .
In time s of de s p a ir , en er g y dr in k s come to my re s c u e .
I get h y p er by the s m e ll alone !
X D Y um m y , never thought s u g ar with 6 dr op s of water mi x ed with other compli c at ed ly - name d things could be quite ta s ty !
V in d ot t ir , our four - f o ot ed c es s po o l , is the cause of this s ten ch .
U n f or t un ate ly , her far t s are s il ent , but de ad ly one s .
My no se ha ir s almost got s c or ch ed by s m el ling that !
My mother k ic k ed her into the ga r d en , because the little f el la tra n s f or m ed into a must ar d ga s fact or y which we could no long er stand .
I i i e k , V in d ot t ir f e as ted on those ta s ty p el le t s , since a little , w il d ra b b it is ha p p i ly ho p p ing on our gra s s f i el d .
F or t un ate ly , the p el le t s have w or n off , so we can b re at he again , p he w !
O ur b a se b a ll tea m is un s k il led and has no v it al ity .
E ver y game , we los e !
I am think ing of cha ng ing position s between p it ch er and f i el d er .
J a p an e se people make this do ll to be s un n y day .
M or e p h ot o s of J i u z ha i g o u
I had heard so much about this place so I want ed to come here .
A c t u ally , B o ur ne m o u th is not a big c ity , but I like this kind of c ity .
While I ' m here , I can feel fresh a ir every day . F ur ther m or e , people have been kind and help ful to me when ever I ' ve got ten los t .
L a st night , I came back from the U S A .
I went to V er m on t , N e w Y or k C ity , D is ne y w or l d and so on ! !
When I ro d e the in ter n ation al a ir p la ne , I was very surprise d ! !
B e c a us e the s ta f f s only speak English and C h in e se .
I went to a J a p an e se re st a ur ant there with my ho st family .
The me n u of the re st a ur ant includ es S us h i ! !
I always want ed to as k . .
I m p or t ant to some body ?
I m p or t ant for some body .
to do something ?
came back after 3 w e e k s
It has been almost one month since I w ro te my last j o ur n al ent ry .
I had trouble with my in ter ne t line 3 week s a g o and it was change d about 2 week s a g o . I then had an end - of - ter m ex a m in ation last week , so I had no time .
F in ally I got time to write a di ar y ent ry and I am so ha p p y !
T h ough this year I have only 1 year ti ll my un ive r s ity ' s entrance ex a m , so I have to sp en d my w in ter va c ation study ing bu s i ly , but I ho pe I w o n ' t los e time to p r a c t ic e my English .
No w , we re ally worry about the F u ku s h im a n u c le ar p ow er p l ant ' s dis aster .
a big e ar th qu a ke in the To h o ku are a , it s co o ling
s y s te m was b ro k en down .
B as ic l ly , we must be co o l the c or e s y s te m so that it w o n ' t run / sp i ll
over and begin to me l t down .
D ur ing this time , the big c ri s is come s as a th re at .
I b ough t a pai r of g l o ve s last C h ri st m as .
They do not full y co ver my f ing er s .
The day before yesterday I went out , I felt ch il ly and I want ed to us e the g l o ve s , but I could find only one of the g l o ve s from my b a g .
I was look ing for the other one at t ent ive ly . I looked into my b a g care ful ly , turn ed back to c he c k on the gr ound , but I f a il ed to find it .
That ' s your s , is n ' t it ? `` I ga ve him a w in n er point again .
I s my hu s b and O K ?
My hu s b and is tru st ed and to re l i ed on by his bo s s , so he is in charge of a l ot .
The day before yesterday , I think he had big pro ble m s .
He never comp la in s to me .
He looked fine and was be h aving normal ly , but he had no a p pe t ite , and in be d he had a night m ar e .
I ' m very w or ri ed , so I want to do something to help him .
A n y way , I should just keep s m il ing as usual right ?
I like A m er ic an dr a m as .
On S at ur day s , I watch H ER O E S on T V .
I watch ed the S A T C mo v i e .
It was very ex c it ing .
I b ough t the sound t r a c k C D .
I am a w ome n who will soon hi t her th ir t ies .
T im e can help you to me n d your w ound s when you just went through a bad re l ation s h i p and it can also b r ing you l o ve at any moment .
P e op le are always s c ar ed to f a ll in l o ve because they do n ' t know that l o ve will la st very long or just a moment to end up with pai n but I never be afraid to take that ri s k .
We only have one life , why do we have to make it so hard ?
F or me , if one day I have to di e , I will di e but my l o ve will stay with some on e that I l o v ed .
A po s it ive l o ve story always make s you ha p p y no matter what people did to you .
It ' s the be st way to live
le ar n ing English
I had to le ar n it when I was a st ud ent .
And I of ten read the for e i g n re p or t s to im p ro ve my English ( v o c a b ul ar y ) .
I was bu y ing a le ar n ing so f t w ar e in F e b r u ar y .
What was the ha p p ies t moment in your life ? W or k a h o l ic guy .
I ' m a work a h o l ic .
The ha p p ies t moment s in my life are when I a ch i e ve something at work .
F or ex amp le , I felt ha p p y when I w on a s al es a w ar d at my work p la ce and I feel ha p p y when c ust ome r s give me a per f e c t s c or e on a c ust ome r ' s s ur ve y .
I like my job as a s al es person because I can con t ri b ut e to c ust ome r s ' business .
I ' m re ally ha p p y when I get a con t r a c t and a c ust ome r is going to be sat is f i ed by our s er v ic e .
My friend call s me `` M r .
M an y J a p an e se people ha te to work all day but I do n ' t even know what an `` a p p ro p ri ate `` work ing time is .
J a p an e se la b or law s say s 8 hour s at work is a p p ro p ri ate but I feel like the se de f in i tion s and pocket s no long er ex is t .
And those tra d i tion al de f in i tion s and work p la ce r ul es , I do n ' t think they a p p ly in the future .
So , it would be better to feel ha p p y by a ch i e v ing something even if you need to work very hard .
W or k ing very hard is a part of J a p an e se c ul ture and we can feel our ha p p ies t when we de v o te our s el ve s to w ar d a c ust ome r ' s success .
V a c ation s are im p or at n t act u ally , but for me , work ing hard is more im p or t ant .
I certain ly ho pe that my work is a b ri d g e between va ri ous a p p ro a ch es with in new g en er ation s ' work ing style s and I ho pe they feel ha p p y through their work .
T ow ar d a T O E I C s c or e of 6 0 0
I us ed to us e English , but I hard ly us e English now .
There f or e I ' m afraid whether or not I can re c o ver my English ability .
I watch ed the mo v i e `` B la c k S w an `` in which N at al i e P or t man appear s .
I ' ve been interest ed in her since I watch ed it .
So she has two n ation al it ies : I s r a el i and A m er ic an .
I c a n ' t believe it .
She is so in te ll i g ent .
I think many J e w are very s m ar t .
F or that reason . . .
B e c a us e I had b ough t a good ma t t re s s and a p i ll ow too , sleep ing became my ho b b y .
It s called the tru e sleep er p re m i um .
It is a re ally pretty day in B an g k o k .
It was ra in ing this morning
I could see water from the s k y co ver ed the tree s around my house .
It ' s re ally pretty co o l .
The day before yesterday I went to watch a mo v i e with my friend around my house . I was re ally s c ar ed and enjoy ed it .
D o you like s c ar y mo v ies ? ? ?

I receiv ed the re s ul t s of my English ex a m yesterday .
In particular , writing and speak ing s k i ll s .
I re al i z e that writing on L an g - 8 is so effect ive in im p ro v ing writing s k i ll s .
I he s it at ed to write my opinion and my da i ly life in English to the public before , because my English s k i ll s are not very good .
I also re al i z ed that I need not he s it ate after read ing many comp o s i tion s from my friend s on L an g - 8 .
I will keep on le ar n ing English , even more in ten s ive ly .
I want to write a paper .
To day , I found this S N S and . w ro te a letter
My ma j or is an at o m y and p h y s i o l o g y of s u g ar c an e .
read the paper and said `` your e ng l ish not enough ``
I would like to write e ng l ish da i ly .
This is E ri k o who is an un ive r s ity st ud ent in J a p an , Ka n a g a w a P re f e c ture .

This is my first j o ur n al and I ' m a little b it n er v ous writing in English because I have no con f id ence to co m m un ic ate with other s in English .
L a st week en d I went to N ar a K o u en n in N ar a p re f . to see ch er ry b l o s s o m s .
The f l ow er s were not in full b l o o m yet but some tree s had many beautiful f l ow er s .
We can re ally enjoy them for about one week .
M a y b e next week en d will be the be st time to enjoy the f l ow er s . I will go to see the f l ow er s in K y ot o .
It is in e v it able that there will be job los se s .
If you become sleep y when you are not suppose d to , what do you do ?
I want to le ar n English , tra ve l , eat , sleep and more . . . .
This is one of my f a v o ur ite tra c k s / so ng s from this al b um .
I found a new way to le ar n English .
I can cha t with them and not to worry about any body laugh ing about my mistake s .
A ll the people are le ar n ing .
We can cha t free ly .
But it has a pro ble m .
A ll the people are le ar n ing , so some time s we can not find our mistake s , act u ally we do n ' t re al i z e it at all .
B e c a us e we are all ch in e se n at ive , we have no any English n at ive to help us .
My C o ll e g e L if e ~ ~
When I ' m think ing back about life since I first stepped f o ot on my co ll e g e c amp us , I re ally feel that I have gr ow n up .
I ma j or in J a p an e se , which is suppose d to be a time - con s um ing sub j e c t .
A t the begin n ing of co ll e g e life , I consider ed tak ing part in some c l u b s , and f il led in some for m s to hand in .
In the mean time I me t some new people who became my be st friend s la ter .
S pe a k ing of friend s , I need to say that they ' re re ally im p or t ant to me on my ro ad .
They ' re all old er than me , so I of ten receiv e us e ful help from them , and I am gr ate ful for it .
A fter I got us ed to co ll e g e life , the place which full of cha ll e ng es , I began to think of how to b al ance the time between study ing and life .
l ot s time every day .
No w it see m s like a short age of time .
My ma j or teachers said that it ' s better to conc ent r ate my at ten tion on my st ud ies if I ' m not too f as c in at ed with any other act i v it ies .
So I ch o se my ma j or .
But it does n ' t mean that I have a b and on ed all of my va ri ous act i v it ies .
I at ten d ed a J a p an e se S pe e ch C on t est and w on a p ri z e .
It give s me l ot s of con f id ence to study .
S in ce co ll e g e began , I have know n for the first time that success is on my side .
And from now on I will try my be st to become a success ful co ll e g e st ud ent , no matter how many difficult ies come s .
We had some time to do our gradua tion re se ar ch to day .
We have that time three time s a week .
The t est week will start from t w o days after tomorrow .
Where as , I p re p ar ed for my re se ar ch .
This week I have many t est s .
I want to get high s c or es , but it ' s very hard for me .
If ( When ? ) this t est week ( end s ) , sp r ing va c ation will come soon .
Then I want to get my dr ive r ' s l ic en se .
why t al ent ed people are la z y
But as I know myself , I know I am a very t al ent ed man .
D es p ite my position in life , I have other c a p a b il it ies , too .
But I do not us e them , at least in my free time .
F or ex amp le , I have a g if t for m us ic and I can play three m us ical in st r u ment s .
You can say every body has this c a p ability or you can say every body could have this t al ent .
But , different ly from other s , I have a natural ability .
When I play a m us ical in st r u ment , every on e ' s first question is , where were you ed u c at ed , or how did you get this ability .
When I say I gradua ted no m us ic school , and I have no m us ical education , they are surprise d .
My other t al ent is pai n ting , and my first work was a p or t r a it of my father when I was 1 3 - 1 4 year s old .
My c ous in is a pro f es s ion al ar t is t , and he pai n t s on a pro f es s ion al le ve l .
I say this , because he was the person who va l u ed my first serious work .
I was pro ud of myself at the time , because a pro f es s ion al ar t is t ga ve me such high prais e .
No w I am so la z y , I can not make free time to con t in u e and to present my hi d d en t al ent .
I am a ng ry at myself , because I do not have a d ur able English course be s id es the one here at this help ful sit e , and the help of my good teacher S ar a h u .
A ll kind s of things come from the sea .
But the p ow er of the s un change s everything .
I think there are many kind s of co l o ur in life .
So we should l o ve our live s .
When I ' m free ,
S u ch as draw ing , de s i g n ing and do ing the things which other s never do .
I think my me m or y is too bad , so I do n ' t like to re m e m b er w or d s .
The day before yesterday , I try to re m e m b er English w or d s .
A t first , I felt that it was difficult for me . ( P a st ten se )
But after I re m e m b er ed a f e w w or d s , I knew how to do it by an easy way and I feel it is good work .
The day before yesterday , I c he c k ed the we a ther for e c a st .
I was ha p p y to he ar that because the co l d days had been con t in u ing .
When I w o ke up yesterday , I looked outside the w in d ow on ti p - to es , but it was ra in ing . . .
B e c a us e of that , I le ar n ed I must not ( not to ) tru st we a ther for e c a st s .

I was not able to get enough last night ( not only last night .

S c i ence can give only a limit ed answer for the se kind of question s .
It has long been believe d that gra v it ation is an at t r a c t ive for ce which at t r a c t s ma s se s to each other .
A ccord ing to this the or y , when there is a ma s s ( or e qu i v al ent en er g y ) at some point , sp a ce and time around it are c ur v ed by the p re s ence of it .
And la ter , the ex p an s ion of the un ive r se was dis c o ver ed to be act u ally tru e .
A t the very begin n ing of the un ive r se , everything includ ing us was pack ed into one point .
In fact , more than 9 5 per c ent of the comp on ent s of the un ive r se are un k n ow n one s , such as `` dark en er g y `` and `` dark matter `` .
I w an n a let people know about my way of think ing , thought s , person al ity and so on .
I think that if people ho pe to bu il d good re l ation s h i p s with other s , they have to talk about va ri ous things and make a l ot of time for talk ing .
In J a p an e se , I can talk about a l ot of to p ic s serious ly and some time s make people laugh with funny st or ies .
But my le ve l of English does not all ow me to be able to express myself per f e c t ly .
I usual ly feel str es s .
I believe this feel ing of a ng er will make me better .
I found it in a b ook called M o m o , an G er man f ant as y no ve l .
The qu ot ation from M o m o is as follow s :
`` Some time s , when you ' ve a very long street a head of you , you think how ter ri b ly long it is and feel sure you ' ll never get it s w ept ;
And that ' s how it ough t to be . ``
I have a t est is coming up
I re ally do not want to eat them again
This s um m er I will never eat noodle s .
I re c ent ly became h ook ed on C y w or l d .
I want to see some friend s .

I will work hard
I s J a p an to l er ant enough ? ( sound s more natural )
The a u th or is R i ch ar d F l or id a who is a p rofessor of the U n ive r s ity of T or on t o .

P e op le who is have c re at i v ity such as , e ng in e er s , s c i ent is t s , ar t is t s , an a ly st s , law y er s and do c t or s .
The reason why he e m p ha s i z es hu man c re at i v ity is that they ( who ? ) c re ate 3 0 % of the who le a c c um ul at ed we al th in A m er ic a .
The ra t i o is gr ow ing .
There f or e , the s us tain able e c on o m ic gr ow th depend s on it .
That is what J a p an want s as well .
A ccord ing to the a u th or , the e le ment s for e c on o m ic de ve l op ment in 2 1 c ent ur y are te ch no l o g y , t al ent and to l er ance .
He es pe c i ally e m p ha s i z ed to l er ance .
B e c a us e , unless there is h enough to l er ance , people who are c re at ive do n ' t want to come or stay at the are a .
And now I wonder whether J a p an has enough to l er ance or not .
It is probab ly not enough so far .
( I just stop p ed writing for a moment .
My name is K on a .
I am us ing this sit e for the first time !
That ' s a little about me . How do you do ?
B y the way , I ' m a st ud ent p re p ar ing for tak ing ex a m in ation s next year .
So , I am here to p r a c t ic e some English ! !
The impress ion that I do . ? ? ?
P er f e c t s um m er has come here .
You must never for g e t to have some bo t t le of water , if you go outside .
Even if you are in your home , you never for g e t to take some dr in k s per i o d ic ally .
D o you have some p l an s to enjoy s um m er ?
The b a b y who insist s on eat ing only y o g ur t made me c ry .
I los e my mind when they smile at me or try to hold my hand with their l o ve ly small f ing er s .
She was asked to take care of the b a b y .
She thought it would be easy .
The b a b y re f us ed everything but the s u g ar ed y o g ur t and then the little s c ar y f i en d b ur st o ut c ry ing , my friend said .
I have the same ex pe ri ence act u ally , so I could understand to t ally how much she was e m b ar r as s ed .
She asked me to take care of her ch il d re n .
She comp le te ly f r ust r at ed me .
O f course I was in another room at that moment .
I did n ` t want to s c ar e my nephew and n i e ce
However , my nephew heard me s c re a m .
He c a ut i ous ly asked me why I s c re ame d when I was in another room .
I felt g u il ty so I hu g g ed him for a while .
But , my n i e ce did stop c ry ing .
The sit u ation that the b a b ies ' mother saw seemed pe a ce ful and per f e c t .
No body was c ry ing .
I was ly ing on the floor of the living room hold ing her b a b ies when she came back home .
She told me that her b a b ies must had have been good and sweet while she was out because her ch il d re n were good and they l o v ed me .
`` You do n ' t know what happen d !
You have to know how much your little d aught er was st u b b or n ! ! !
It ` s the most difficult job to take care a b a b y who insist s on only eat ing y o g ur t .
B e f or e I had my bo y , I had n ' t been interest ed in v ot ing and po l it ic s .
I did n ' t even v o te .
No w a day s , I c he c k a can d id ate ' s po l ic ies before v ot ing .

Tokyo D is ne y l and !
Yes ter day , I went to Tokyo D is ne y l and with my friend s .
A l th ough we could ri d e only three at t r a ction s because it was very c r ow d ed ,
we made a l ot of good me m or ies .
If I could re c o m m en d you one of them , I would of ch o o s en `` S s a m `` .
Then you can eat it with the me at w r a p p ed in the leave s .
If you want S s a m to ta s te more de l ic i ous , you can eat it with va ri ous kind s of ve g e t able s .
K or e an people usual ly eat it with so y be an past e s a u ce or re d pe p p er past e s a u ce .

I F ound How to U se English in a N e w W a y !
That is a B ri t ish bra n d and they pro d u ce a l ot of stuff with f l ow er print s .
L a st week I tri ed to im p or t two different ty pe s of b a g s from an on line C a th K id st on sh op .
It ' s kind of cha ll e ng ing for me because the on line sh op is only in English .
To day I receiv ed the two b a g s in the a b o ve picture s from E ng l and .
I think if I had n ' t been le an ing English , I could n ' t im p or t them by myself .
R i g h t now I ' m think ing about which stuff I want to bu y next time .
If I can understand English , it is possible for me to bu y many things from on line sh op s which are only English .
To tell you to the tru th , we can bu y a l ot of C a th K id st on things in J a p an .
I also I can bu y ra re things which I c a n ' t get in J a p an .
I think that it may be for va ri ous reason s , but there is a very funny reason .
It is a f a m ous f est i v al in H o k k a id o u .
This year was the 1 9 th f est i v al .
M or e two hu n d r ed tea m s part ic i p at ed in the f est i v al .
There were a l ot of tea m s from other are as of J a p an .
Y O S A K O I is a p ow er ful da n c ing comp e t i tion and it en c o ur age s people .
The each tea m has a them e and they make an original dance ro ut in e and a
The co st um es were co l or ful .
They be at dr um s .
The v i b r at ing sound hu r t a little .
I m p ro v ing my English s k i ll s
I need to im p ro ve my e ng l ish s k i ll s ( in for m al and in f or m al ) .
However , I prefer to speak on M S N me s se ng er .
If you can help me you may a d d `` e ness a y ha @ hot m a il .
And I can help any on e who is try ing to le ar n T ur k ish .
F ur ther m or e , ex p and ed their business and provide d their te ch no l o g ies ( in / to ) e m er g ing co un t ri es which in c re a se in de m and for en er g y .

But unti l to day ' s no on , nothing has been done yet .
F in ally I man age d it but it will be much hard er to be ch o s en for the in ter n s h i p .
I ho pe I have good l u c k .
A l s o in J a p an , there had been a c at which said same line s in the 8 0 s .
`` N ame r u `` c ar ri es a do u ble mean ing in J a p an e se ; one is `` look down on `` and the other is `` l ic k . ``
J o b transfer away from home
I have been work ing away from home since O c t o b er .
So I have to c ook dinner , do the la un d ry , c le an up my room and so on .
S in ce my comp an y g u ar ant e es to return me to my home t ow n t w ic e a

We have two ch il d re n , a six year old d aught er and a six month old so n , so I ' m look ing for w ar d to see ing them .
It ' s a ch il d re n ' s b ook and has a style like a di ar y and po e t ry .
The ma in character A n n i e , who is t w el ve , like s run n ing and draw ing .
She write s about her friend s , es pe c i ally her run n ing part n er M a x , and her teachers and family .
He re is his di ar y . P le a se make c or re ction s for him ^ ^
`` O h , my f ing er ! ! ``
To day , our school had a sp or t s day .
So , we did many ex er c is es , like run n ing .
When I was p r a c t ic ing long j um p ing , I f e ll down on t o the floor .
I ho pe this is n ' t a big pro ble m ! !
this morning I play ed `` so f t ten n is `` .
The r ul es are similar to those in normal ten n is .
In J a p an , there are many so f t ten n is play er s .
I have been play ing it since I was in j un i or high school .
If you get the ch ance to play , please try it .
I have a ex a m about da ta b as es next w ed ne s day .
So , I must for study it . . . .
I need a language part n er
I w an n a have a language part n er who live s in D a e j e on , K or e a .
I can tea ch K or e an , and I ' d like to le ar n English .
R e w ri te : We can talk about ( dis c us s ) any kind of to p ic .
I now have a b l o g ! How ex c it ing !
My name is B ad r , I ' m an 1 8 year old guy from M or o c c o .
English is n ' t my n at ive language , however I re ally would like to become a f l u ent speak er because I might study in an English speak ing country after I gradua te from H i g h - S ch o o l , and I also re ally a p p re c i ate this language .
I ' m ha p p y I found this we b s ite because I can now p r a c t ic e my written English .
M e an w h i le I could try to help you out with my n at ive language , F re n ch !
R e c ent ly , I ' m into D I Y .
A c t u ally , I was n ' t interest ed in D I Y before I made the c age for my pe t l i z ar d .
A fter that , I le ar n t how f un it was ma k ing something with w o o d .
No w , I ' m ma k ing a ha ng er ra c k for my room .
I ho pe it will be good f ur n i ture .
F i g ur ing out a very im p or t ant thing for my so n .
I have been s u f f er ing since last O c t o b er , because my so n was n ' t sleep well at night .
It ' s the room te m p er a ture . . .
It was so co l d for him he could n ' t sleep well .
I am a new c ome r .
I have friend s who m I l o ve and a d or e very much .
He re is the guy that I very strong ly l o ve .
My s is ter ` s bo y f ri en d has sen t me an in v it ation for this on line game .
When I started play ing it , I felt b or ed , because I have play ed T r a v i an before which was an ex c it ing game .
Yes ter day morning , I have read the F A Q of the game and I get to understand the be a ut y of it .
There is w o o d and other four l u x ur y ma ter i al s from the other is l and s , so you can b r ing just one of them .
There is re se ar c , where you can in v ent new bu il d ing s and other ex t r as , there are go d s ( this is a an c i ent G re e k game ) , you can at ta c k other play er s , and bu il d new co l on ies in other is l and s , so you need to bu y sh i p s and bu il d b at t le s h i p .
If you feel like play ing , I can sen d you an in v it ation to the hung ar i an serve r s ' L a m b d a ' and ' My ' : )
and I ' m new me m b er on la ng - 8 , I ho pe I can find some friend who can tea ch me some language s , and of course c or re c t my English .
T h an k you . .
E s pe c i ally while work ing , I would get in trouble .
A c t u ally I work for a c r a m school .
One day , may b e about half a year a g o , I hu r t one of the students in my class because of what I said .
O f course , I had not expect ed that to happen at all .
As you can im a g in e , the st ud ent kept a dis t ance between us after that .
Then I started to think that I have to take great care of what I ' m saying so that I do n ' t hu r t any m or e students .
However that has made it very a w k w ar d to talk to them .
those were not my w or d .
F in ally , I con s ul ted my bo s s .
He game me some a d v ic e .
That made me feel so re l i e v ed .
I ' ve st ud i ed English for a long time , for more than 1 0 year s .
However , I ' m un able to speak it f l u ent ly now .
That is re ally a sh ame .
So , I have been see k ing a go al for study ing it .
If I have a go al , it will give me an ur g e to study much hard er .
If I am to be hi r ed , I must take respon s i b il ity for that .
When teaching something to some on e , a teacher must be s c r up ul ous and p at i ent .
I ' m a la z y person , so I have to give it a try !
He ll o , every on e .
I ' ve just sign ed up to L an g - 8 to day .
S in ce I want to im p ro ve my writing s k i ll s , I will be work ing hard on writing j o ur n al s .
In the ex a m , I will be require d to write a business letter or an e - ma il to an im a g in ar y friend .
There f or e , I will ma in ly us e L an g - 8 in or d er to me e t the require ment s for the writing p or tion of the English pro f ic i en c y ex a m .
I will po st the t est as s i g n ment s into my j o ur n al s and re p ly to them .
It has been a long long time since I last w ro te an English ar t ic le
No w when I try to say something in English , J a p an e se always come s to my mind first , al th ough I still c a n ' t us e ( speak ? ) J a p an e se f l u ent ly .
I s this because of `` In er t i a `` ? ( ha b it ? )
I have le ar n ed English for over ten year s , but I wonder if I can con m un ic ate with a n at ive English speak er s m o o th ly .
A l th ough I ' m le ar n ing J a p an e se now , I ' m afraid it will turn out the same as English in the long run / over time .
I am con f us ed now .
I know it ' s bad , but it ' s hard to put it right .
It ' s S ud d en , but
I w on t be able to write another j o ur n al ent ry for around 2 week s .
The thing is , as you may know , I ' m mo v ing to a new place which is a little near er than where I ' ve live now
No w I ' m p re p ar ing for the mo ve : c le an ing , pack ing and so on
When I go back to my p ar ent ' s house , I will start writing j o ur n al s again !
This time last year , I was in O re g on in the United States .
I felt that O re g on has beautiful sight s and kind people !
The picture in my pro f i le was also take n when I was in O re g on .
T h ough I went there to study English for a month , I enjoy ed sight se e ing and play ing sp or t s with my friend s .
I think my English has im p ro v ed since then .
I will simpl y explain it
F ir st , ch op the c a b b age .
M i x ch op p ed c a b b age with a c up of w he at f l o ur and a c up of water to make it f l o ur - th ic k en ed .
P ut mi x ture on he at ed p an and sp re ad it th in like p i z z a .
P an - f ry it unti l the s ur f a ce get s s light ly b r ow n .
And then turn it over to p an - f ry it s another side
I watch ed T an g led without sub t it le s to study English .
I can understand some , but not all , of the di al o gue .
I ho pe that , one day , I will be able to watch T an g led without sub t it le s and understand everything per f e c t ly .
L a st two week s I have had some un e x pe c ted free l ance work , so I tri ed to re m e m b er some im p or t ant hot ke y s in C or el D r a w and P h ot o s h op , that s why I ' m here just now .
A c t u ally , in my n at ive c ity , it mean s that I p re p ar e other de s i g n er ' s works for p u b l ish ing , and some time s I have to c re ate something by myself .
U s u ally it is something like f o o d la b el s , not too comp le x or c re at ive .
F ur ther m or e , C h ri st m as is in the w in ter and it is right around the corner . It is n ' t a ho l i day in T a i w an , but most people like this f est i v al since it make s us feel w ar m from the inside .
In the past , I usual ly went to a re st a ur ant to ce le b r ate C h ri st m as , but I have no idea this year .
M an y sh op s se ll C h ri st m as pro d u c t s , also I have no idea how to p re p ar e a g if t for C h ri st m as .
This is my first day writing a di ar y .
I am a st ud ent at a language school in the U S A .
My teacher told me I should write some sen t ence s every day .
My le ve l is l ow er in ter m ed i ate .
P le a se c he c k my sen t ence s .
I came back to this we b - sit e again to day .
It ' s been a long time since I did not return to this sit e , because my job make s me so bu s y .
I ho pe I had more time to us e this sit e to write my di ar y .
I ' m than k ful for the friend s who c or re c t my di ar y .
B e c a us e the friend who live d in Tokyo was a p re g n ant woman , she took she l ter at her p ar ent s place .
It is serious .
the w or st is I have n ' t de c id ed my to p ic yet .
Yes ter day , I went to an It al i an re st a ur ant with my w if e and my K or e an friend s who are a co up le .
No ne of us can speak English well , but the funny thing is , we could co m m un ic ate very s m o o th ly because the pro no un c i ation of English that my K or e an friend s speak was e as i er to listen to than a n at ive A m er ic an one .
M is ta ke s my K or e an friend s made were very similar to mi ne , such as ten se and s ing l ar / p l ur al .
We J a p an e se some th im es feel e m b ar r as s ing to hu g when gr e e ting with A m er ic an s . ( see be l ow )
So I felt very co m f or t able ha ng ing out with K or e an friend s .
I went to V id e o G ame s L ive in J a p an on the 2 2 n d of S ept e m b er .
V id e o G ame s L ive ( V G L ) is a conc er t even t f e at ur ing m us ic from p op ul ar v id e o game s .
They ' ve he l d the even t at many c it ies in the world ex c ept Tokyo .
This is the first time that they play ed the the show in J a p an .
The perform ance was started with a funny short f il m play ed by act or s who put on P a c man co st um es cha s ing each other .
The pro g r a m f e a ture s a l ot of v id e o game s m us ic , for ex amp le : K ing d o m He ar t s , M e t al G e ar So l id , S up er M ar i o B ro s . , F in al F ant as y and so on .
H is well know n works are C h ro no T ri g g er , C h ro no C ro s s , and X en o g e ar s .
The C h ro no T ri g g er and C h ro no C ro s s me d le y was also f ant a st ic .
That ' s because the con d u c t or , J a c k , play ed the g u it er with the s y m p h on y .
U n b el i e v able , but so ex ce ll ent .
When the perform ance finish ed , the a ud i ence b ur st into an ent h us i a st ic a p p la us e .
I ho pe that they come back to J a p an .
U ne x pe c ted ly , I me t a bo y who came back from P e k ing just before .
He always said that I should p r a c t ic e J a p an e se more while I am in J a p an , because it ' s hard to find a J a p an e se to p r a c t ic e with you in T a i w an .
There are , but in c r a m school s .
I went to the go l f ra ng e with my father who live s in M at s u y a m a and is 6 8 year s old .
I ho pe he keep s play ing go l f for ever .
T u es day J an u ar y 4 th , 2 0 1 1 . / S un n y D a y
To day , I bo il ed sweet black be an s .
So I of ten c ook dis he s with be an s in or d er to eat them .
I was able to c ook them so that they were ta s ty .
B y the way , do you know that be an s are very good for our he al th ?
B e an s have l ow f at , l ow c al or ies and high pro te in .
There are many pro ce s s ed f o o d s that us e be an s in J a p an e se s up er - mar ke t s .
They ta s te very good .
S t ar t to go to school on next M on day !
I change d school this s um m er because I think I do not f it in re g ul ar high s ch o o l
I always get th ir d last p la c ing in our class .
In every body ' s impress ion , I ' m just a girl who l o ve s to play , dress and
I do something that I want with my str e ng th in or d er to a ch i e ve in the future , S u ch as study English and dance .
I study English very hard , I got 9 0 point s which is over a ver age about 3 0 point s in every ex a m , and I like da n c ing ( j a z z ) , I can do it well .
are just not my things .
I change d the way which made me re a ch my go al e as i er , it does n ' t mean that I ' m a b and on ing myself or I am a bad girl .
I ' ve just le ar n ed something that c aught my f an c y .
I have a strong sen se what I ' m do ing , and why I ' m stand ing here .
I must go to school tomorrow .
I felt n er v ous and de p re s s ed
What kind friend s will I me e t there ?
What kind of person is going to be my home ro o m teacher
What about the en v i ro ment ?
I ' m just c ur i ous . . . .
M a y every body have a good night .
It will be con se c ut ive ho l i day s start ing tomorrow In J a p an .
This ho l i day is called G o l d en We e k .
D o es that see m like a strange name ?
I looked up why we call it `` G o l d en We e k `` in the W i k i .
Some mo v i e comp an y ' s direct or name d it in 1 9 5 1 .
B e c a us e this ho l i day ' s mo v i e s al es were big g er than the new year s ho l i day and s um m er ho l i day .
In a w or d , this go l d was go l d en for the mo v i e mar ke t .
B y the way , I will have f un with my family d ur ing go l d en week .
U n t il I left un ive r s ity dormitory when I was in 2 n d gra d e of my un ive r s ity , I had a small one .
So when I mo v ed to another dormitory , I left it behind .
S in ce then , I have live d without a T V .
As it happen ed , my w if e - to - be did not have a T V either .
Even when we got mar ri ed , we did not bu y another one .
I think it ' s better to ch o se pro g r a m s on the in ter ne t or D V D rather than pass ive ly receiv ing pro g r a m s on T V .
It will be bu il t in 5 month s at the l ate st ( ? ) .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to living there .
Yes ter day , it was my bo y f ri en d ' s 2 4 th b ir th day .
I ga ve him a wall e t for his b ir th day .
I went sh op p ing with my w if e in Y o k o ha m a .
To day I b ough t a s u it and at e l un ch .
It ' s fine out so we enjoy ed sh op p ing .
I work ed unti ll no on so I got tired .
But when I sh op with my w if e , It ' s the be st time .
O h . . .
I did something st up id again . . .
A fter having supper , I went with my gr and m a for a walk .
Then I me t my e ng l ish teacher .
She said he ll o to me and I said he ll o to her as well .
But I said he ll o to her by sha k ing my left hand .
Then my gr and m a said , `` You should n ' t say he ll o to people with the left hand .
I s it that a bad thing ?
I s it an off en s ive thing saying he ll o to people with the left hand ?
G ive me an answer ~ please : )
I have to me m or i z e some of my line s because
some time s have a c ough .
M a y b e you have a l ot of ch o ic es .
But in my opinion , all time is very im p or t ant to me .
I need to e ar n more money so that I will make my w if e have a wonder ful life .
Well , I have a l ot of s th ( ? ) to say , but as you know , my English is very poor . To day , I made a big de c is ion , I ' m going to write an ent ry for my di ar y every day that us es what I le ar n from my English b ook .
He ll o ! My name is S a ch i k o . I live in J a p an .
I want to go a b ro ad in the future to talk with many people and study many things , but I c a n ' t ( or can not ) speak English very well . . .
I went to Tokyo last week en d to visit some school s I may want to go to where I can le ar n about teaching J a p an e se , and get a qu al if ic ation to be a teacher .
I visit ed 8 school s in to t al , and some of them seemed to be re ally good , but still I can not de c id e which ( school ) I should go to .
They all co st A L O T , so I need to be care ful in de c id ing which one is be st for me .
I ' m think ing about visit ing the school s again , but I do n ' t re ally want to because . . .
Tokyo is so c r ow d ed .
I can not believe I man age d to live there before .
It is the week en d : D I did my work honest ly .
I have a little s k i ll s .
I ' ll gradua l ly put effort into my work .
I also went to a dr in k ing part y .
No w , I am home .
I went to my c ous in ' s w ed d ing f e a st yesterday , there were about 1 3 t able s of gue st s , mean s only about 1 3 0 people at ten d ed this f e a st , my brother told me that ' s because this is the second time to f e te re l at ive s , only for the f a m il ies of mar ri ed w ome n .
W ome n become more in depend ent , have de s i re to a c c o m p l ish their dr e a m s , get ting mar ri ed is not a re qu is ite .
I want to write something about my every day life on this home p age to study English .
In addition :
P le a se c he c k it out !
One day , I will be a bo s s . No th ing is im po s s i ble .
The part y was very f un and the f o o d was very de l ic i ous .
So I ' ll dr a f t my j o ur n al / po st in my free time .
I know , the be st way to so l ve this pro ble m is to bu y a new P C .
This way will be c he a p er than bu y ing , but I have to study how to do it .
A n y way , it ' s about time to go to sleep .
A ng l o S a x on s are always s un bath ing there .
I think they get s un b ur n t .
I b ough t a new `` S A N Y A N G `` mo p ed in 2 0 0 6 which is a good ex p en s ive bra n d here .
However , short ly after it was st o le n again .
When I live d in J a p an , some body st o le my H on d a s c o o ter .
The th i e f just a b and on ed it some where , may b e because it ra n out of ga s on the way .
I went to the H P D to day , because they re st or ed the st o le n mo p ed to me .
I did n ' t understand that they mean t `` just the f r ame `` .
The police office r told me that the th i e ve s took off my mo p ed ' s part s .
P ro b ably for s el ling the e ng in e , the sea t and almost all other part s .
I need ed to re ne w the st ic k er for p ic k ing up the f r ame .
D o n ' t you think it s ri d ic ul ous to have to re ne w the st ic k er ?
I do n ' t want to bu y part s to put the mo p ed back to g e ther .
I just want to take picture s of how mi s er able my mo p ed look s !
M or e o ver , I was dis a p po in ted .
If I had n ' t go ne to H P D , I never would have know n that they found the f r ame .
The police office r neither called me no r left a me s s age .
They just sen t a letter to my old address , even though I ' ve already told them my new address .
don t look at me again , and I w o n ' t I look at you again
He l p M e with The In ter p re t ation !
O ur teacher asked every on e to ch o o se a for e i g n paper , and in ter p re t it into C h in e se .
I have just finish ed one - th ir d .
One week pass ed by so f a st . No w I re g re t play ing game s with my friend , tea r s . . .
R e t ur n ing to the in ter p re t ation again . . .
You may know that I have a bo y f ri en d in J a p an if you read my j o ur n al .
who I me t in L on d on .
I c a n ' t comp ar e them because they live in di f f er ence place s and they are comp le te ly different .
My bo y f ri en d in J a p an is a quiet and in a c t ive .
He is the to t al op po s ite of me
We do n ' t have any co m m on interest s .
My friend s some time as k me .
I talk ed to him about everything .
He listen ed quiet ly .
He usual ly did n ' t say his opinion ex c ept about im p or t ant pro ble m s .
We are still be st friend s .
He ' d never hold ( ? ) my hand without as k ing me ( ? )
He ' s never k is s ed me .
I think our re l ation s h i p is different from usual .
The other one is very act ive and we have some co m m on interest s .
We talk about our co m m on interest s .
Some time s he say s his opinion and I listen to it .
He want ed to hold my hand .
P ro b ably I will c he at on my bo y f ri en d .
I am afraid of los ing him .
My object ive for this year is to c l im b up M t .
I have n ' t written an ent ry for two month s ! ! !
I have for g ot ten some English .
It has been two month s since I came back from A ust r al i a .
I went to A ust r al i a for only e i g h t month s .
J ust a person al opinion .
We just thought w ed d ing s in C h ri st i an ch ur ch es were ro man t ic and act u ally , it was wonder ful for us .
My p ar ent s are B ud d h is t s , while my w if e ' s p ar ent s are believe r s in S h in t o , but no ne of them have en f or c ed us to believe in their re l i g ion s .
O f course , I always keep serious ly o b s er v ing the r ul es state d at the sit e while visit ing them .
I ' m respect all re l i g ion s and am interest ed in them .
I don ate b l o o d re g ul ar ly and I always feel ha p p y and pe a ce ful after that because I did something good for some on e .
Yes ter day , I came up with a kind of thing while g i v ing b l o o d on the be d , al th ough I know it ' s im po s s i ble for some re l i g ion s to a d m it b l o o d don ation .
I believe every on e should accept the conc ept of va l u es from different re l i g ion s , and I ho pe my be ha v i or s and thought s about re l i g ion s never hu r t any on e .
F ro m now on , I ' d like to ex pe ri ence different c ul ture s close ly re la ted with any re l i g ion s more of ten .
L A S I K e y e s ur g er y , which is us ed to c or re c t people ' s v is ion and end their need for their g la s se s or con ta c t l en se s , is ga in ing p op ul ar ity in J a p an .
I had s ur g er y and re c o ver ed my e y e sight .
The high perform ance machi ne re d u ce s ri s k .
He ll o ! This is my first ent ry .
I ' m a begin n er of English .
I ' d like to be friend s with many people all over the world .
I ' m a de s i g n er of in ter i or ar ch ite c t ur i al pro d u c t s .
I l o ve many ty pe s of m us ic .
My favor ite ar t is t is My b l o o d y va l ent in e , B e ll and S e b a st i an , B o ar d s of C an ad a , A ku f en , R ad i o head . . .
I like tak ing picture s .
This picture was take n in a z o o
I do n ' t speak English well enough .
P le a se tea ch me
I ho pe that I can always do that .
But I was re ally surprise d that the ga r b age c or re ction started from 6 . A M .
Well , now I have st o m a ch pai n because we at e gr il led me at , but I will write about ra n k ing of T a k a i which is difficult to e le c t every time .
The ra n k ing is de c id ed by my go n z o , and some on e who too much speak ed about b l u e j o ke s in my L a b re c ent ly ra n k s in it .
A fter my S E N P A I gradua ted from my L a b , the sit u ation in room is im p ro v ed , but it become s difficult for me to de c id e the ra n k ing .
R e c en ly , I de c id ed to try a long ter m in ter n s h i p .
In J a p an , long ter m in ter n s h i p s are not very p op ul ar .
I heard that people in other co un t ri es are very interest ed in in ter n s h i p s .
I am a J a p an e se st ud ent , but I think that most J a p an e se students do n ' t have as much e age r ness as students in other ( for e i g n ) co un t ri es for in ter n s h i p s .
I am w or ri ed about this sit u ation .
I wonder if this will change .
We went to watch the ten n is to ur n a ment s in the N ation al A th l etic M e e t in N a g a o k a .
The to ur n a ment s were tea m comp e t i tion s , with two s ing le s and a do u ble s .
So we could watch many game s , and they were all am a z ing !
A ll of the play er s were almost pro f es s ion al .
L ot s of people ga ther ed in the ga ll er ies and we had a great time watch ing the se game s .
She has play ed ten n is some time s with her friend s re c ent ly , but I never do .
A fter we watch ed the game s , we talk ed to each other and we felt like play ing ten n is again .
So may b e next week en d we will play ten n is near our place .
A n y way , they had a f un time because of their p ar ent s being out in the day time !
In J a p an , come d y T V show s have been very p op ul ar for a long time .
There are so many come d i an s in J a p an .
You ng and old , so many kind s of come d i an s .
I like to watch most of the T V come d y show s . ( sound s better )
H a ve you watch ed the T V come d y show s of J a p an ?
What is the di f f er ence between J a p an T V come d y show s and your country ' s T V come d y show s ?
I of ten write ent ri es about ar t at L an g - 8 .
To day , I ' ve want ed to in t ro d u ce ar t the r a p y .
M an y people are un a c c ust ome d to the p re s s ur e of mo d er n life .
If some on e could n ' t accept the p re s s ur e around their life , they may have been feel ing down and s ad for a long time . So they probab ly are feel ing me l an ch o l i a .
A r t can be a good for the r a p y , be s id es see ing a p s y ch i at ri st or p s y ch o l o g is t s .
The p at i ent could re la x and have the free d o m of express ion by pai n ting .
This was my first less on at the ar t the r a p y class .
I just tri ed it be c u a se all students are volunteer s .
) D ur ing our first less on , The teacher told us , `` P le a se im age your life five , ten , and twenty year s la ter . Even when you are an old person , then draw the different per i o d s . ``
We wait ed for all the students to finish . Then the teacher asked us to sha re our person al pai n ting s with each other .
T al k ing about ar t the r a p y has a l ot of way s it could help p at i ent s re c o ver . I re m e m b er once our teacher asked us to us e the tri ch ro m at ic for pai n ting s .
I have been to ar t and dance the r a p y class es before . A l th ough ; da n c ing has always been number one in my heart . I thought ar t the r a p y is more interest ing than dance the r a p y .
We can understand different person al it ies by co l or s every on e us ed .
M a y b e it was v i v id , s ad , or a ha p p i ness feel ing .
Some time s co l or s like a co m m on language can express our e m o tion s .
This pai n ting was c re at ed by some on e else , but I a d m ir ed it .
A big mo us e at home . It look s very co o l !
No w it is 6 : 0 0 A M in Tokyo
He ll o .
S or ry I w ro te to day ' s ent ry very l ate .
I had a l ot of ta s k s to do .
A fter I comp le ted them , I had a re st before writing a new ent ry at 2 : 0 0 A M .
But it seemed that I f e ll as le e p d ur ing this re st .
When I became con s c i ous , it was near ly 6 : 0 0 A M .
C er tain ly , I was very tired before sleep ing .
B y the way , it was co o l in Tokyo yesterday .
I felt f a ll .
To day is F ri day .
So I will do my be st .
B y e by e .
D o you like this b and ' s m us ic ?
To me , I like it very much .
Some people regard s it as ex p l ic it m us ic as there are too many s w e ar w or d s .
But is it re ally tru e ?
I do n ' t want to de n y them those way s to re la x .
L if e is so b it ter and short so do n ' t sha ke your con f id ence .
L if e should be was ted on beautiful things .
A n y way I am so tired this week .
It ' s difficult to w a ke up e ar ly in the morning but I have to .
Why am I tired ?
To o m ch work ?
M a y b e I am str es s ed .
A l s o , I need some n ut ri ent .
I have v it a m in s and O m e g a - 3 .
I have n ' t had the se yet , so I will take them to better my he al th .
A h . .
I want to be c he er ful and act ive .
I need something sp e c i al . .
B e c a us e it ' s very m u g g y to day !
We propos e a co ll a b or at ive le ar n ing S N S b as ed know led g e a w ar e ness s y s te m for le ar n ing in da i ly life in an u b i qu it ous en v ir on ment .
U t il i z ing the s y s te m , le ar n er s can find an a p p ro p ri ate person who is able to so l ve the pro ble m even if he is a strange r . A n a p p ro p ri ate C F will be re c o m m en d ed upon their request , and then they help each other through the en v ir on ment .
M or e o ver , by do ing this re se ar ch , we found a way to find an a p p ro p ri ate person , found a way to re c o m m en d an a p p ro p ri ate ro ut e and found some f e a ture p at ter n s of as k ing for help .
U s u ally , we dr ive , but this time I ch o se to ri d e ( `` a b ic y c le `` is as s um ed here ) because it was a wonder ful day .
A fter the class , we went to a p ar k to have l un ch there as I had p re p ar ed our pack ed l un ch es .
A b al m y b re e z e was blow ing , so I felt re fresh ed , and my so n seemed to as well .
Yes ter day , I de c id ed to write a di ar y in English start ing to day .
I of ten he ar it said to not start from tomorrow , start to day .
But I ' m start ing it from to day .
I have n ' t written anything here for a long time .
I ' m so s ad , but at the same time I ' m so n er v ous to go back to my country .
I w an to study hard and have f un with my friend s as much as possible .
A st up id guy was s m o k ing we ed in the ha ll way at school .
The teacher told me that my d aught er is not good at saying the m ul t i p l ic ation for 3X 8 and 2 X6 .
But how about when we tra ve l through time ?
A l th ough the se new it e m s make our live s co m f or t able , we can not go back to the er a when no one had his / her own P C and ce ll p h on es .
A t that time we had to wait e ter n ally for some on e we had p l an n ed to me e t if s / he got s ud d en ly into trouble .
My so n who is 9 year s old , does n ' t like do ing ( his ) home w or k .
U s ally he has 3 to 4 as s i g n ment s a day .
It take s him about 1 hour to finish it , if he can f o c us on his work .
However it ' s take n him 2 or 3 hour s , so I ' ve s c o l d ed him almost every day .
To day was another difficult day because of this pro ble m .
I re ally want to qu it fight ing with him about his home w or k .
When will that day ar r ive ?
I am us ing la ng - 8 after a long a b s ence .
I want to be a good speak er of English and C h in e se , so I will try to keep a da ir y in the se language s .
I was k il led by a re d mo n s ter .
This po st is written about F F X I V , which is a M M O R P G .
O f course , I could n ' t go alone , so we made a part y of 8 person s .
They at ta c k ed us one by one .
We f in ally re a ch ed the in n er m o st ,
and the re d mo n s ter in the picture appeared in front of us .
We were k il led in st an ly .
I ' m going to try again and I ho pe we w in .
I watch ed E v an g el ion to night for the first time .
This is more gr ot es qu e than I im a g in ed from the so ng and D V D pack age .
I work for a pro ce s s ed f o o d comp an y in J a p an .
My work in v o l ve s c ook ing a l ot of f o o d , ma in ly ve g e t able s and me at .
No w I ' m j o in ing a pro j e c t ma k ing good ta s te ing ra m en and C h in e se f o o d .
I ' m ha p p y that my pro d u c t s made it into st or es even if l ot s of people do n ' t like the ta s te .
I have to wait unti l M a y to he ar the re s ul t s .
On ho l i day , I usual ly go to re st a ur ant s to think about new f la v or s .
I have thought of new good ta st es that do n ' t se ll in J a p an .
So , I go to for e i g n re st a ur ant s near Y o k o ha m a .
for ex amp le , K or e an , In d i an , M e x ic an , S p an ish , and so on .
If you come to Y o k o ha m a , let me know .
I ' d like to tell you about good re st a ur ant s .
To i le t paper was quick ly so l d out .
I p r a c t ic ed English by watch ing C N N st ud ent new s .
I spoke English on S k y pe .
I had my first ex pe ri ence of speak English with a for e i g n person on S k y pe .
The con ver s ation last ed about 2 5 minute s , but that was good enough for me .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to the next con ver s ation .
I ' m sorry , I ' m not feel ing well to day , I had H y po ten s ion this morning d u e to a l ot of things and I f a in ted .
I hi t my head hard on the floor so I feel a b it w o o z y .
But when I go any where and I see f o o d , I feel dis g ust ed , n a us e ous some h ow .
I c a n ' t explain why .
I just ho pe that I can re c o ver soon so I can con t in u e my f as ting .
Ya m a o k a is one of the character s in the J a p an e se co m ic `` O ish in b o `` , and I have been called this name by my friend s since my under g r ad u ate days because I am similar to him .
I of ten tra ve l through o ut J a p an on business tri p s , and look for w ar d to try ing the l o c al f o o d s even now .
And so , I have to study some for e i g n language s .
I can not read and write here every day , but I will con t in u e to study .
( M a y b e every on e must con t in u e to le ar n through o ut life , not only language . )
B y the way , my w if e st ud ies G er man , and has written her di ar y on the we b .
If you have an interest in c ook ing and study ing G er man , read it , please .
She sen t us a well - made J a p an e se n a il c ut ter this time because she went to J a p an last week .
He r va c ation s are sp on s or ed by our comp an y .
He r ha ir is b r us h ed into a n ic e style .
A c t u ally , she look s more beautiful than usual .
But every body is keep ing quiet to day and look ing for w ar d to her or d er s .
A ll of us seemed to enjoy a who le week of free d o m from the s up er v is ion of my bo s s .
She is a serious person and has very str ic t require ment s for our work .
A g if t is always n ic e for every on e , I think .
G e t ty C ent er
I went to a m us e um , the G e t ty C ent er in L A .
It is l o c at ed on the to p of the hi ll where we can enjoy a p an or a m ic view of L A .
The way there is ( also ) enjoy able .
The second is the pro g r a m s by the m us e um includ ing things from a walk ing to ur to a le c ture of the draw ing , in ten d ed for ( kid s and sen i or s a like ) .
My family was in the re st a ur ant when it began to ra in .
I re ally like to watch mo v ies .
I watch A m er ic an , J a p an e se , K or e an and many other ty pe s of mo v ies .
R e c ent ly , I have a l ot of free time , so I have been watch ing them .
One of the reason s that I study English is because I want to watch mo v ies without c a p tion s .
But it ' s difficult for me . . .
A n y way , I watch ed a mo v i e called `` C l o s er `` .
It made me think about `` l o ve `` .
Some time s it dis t r a c t s us , but l o ve all ow s us to gr ow up more and more .
I want ed to write my opinion , so I tri ed my be st .
On F ri day , I twist ed my left an k le while run n ing .
I did n ' t think my bo ne was b ro k en , but it hu r t .
Yes ter day I went to see the do c t or .
My ho l i day p l an has go ne , but I got a ch ance not only
My d aught er is one year and three month s old .
R e c ent ly , she began to walk .
So , I b ough t some sh o es for her .
When I put the sh o es on her , she c ri ed loud ly and tri ed to take them off .
We ar ing sh o es is strange for her , I gue s s .
I ho pe she ' ll gradua l ly get us ed to we ar ing sh o es .
I could n ' t write a di ar y d ur ing the week because I was bu s y .
I had to go to me n ' s ch or us c l u b .
But I try to keep writing this di ar y and j o in ing c l u b act i v it ies .
You may think it mean s `` U p p er c la s s m en will ent er tain fresh man s `` but in fact , it mean s `` F re s h man s will ent er tain U p p er c la s s m en `` ! !
I and my class m ate s ra n a bo o th s er v ing H ash im a k i .
H ash im a k i is similar to O k on o m i y a k i that is rolled around a ch op st ic k s .
I stay ed the night at my friend ' s house to help p re p ar e .
I stay ed up in the night ch op p ing the c a b b age s . . .
The s c al e of the f est i v al was big g er than that of a high school .
We e k en d !
It was n ic e to sleep in on sat ur day .
No w I feel like I have re ch ar g ed my b at ter ies ! ! !
In the after no on I did my la un d ry , b a k ed m u f f in and st ud i ed for the t est which I w ro te about in this di ar y yesterday .
I ' m going to go to be d e ar l i er to day and I will w a ke up at 4 : 3 0 tomorrow as usual , in or d er to p re p ar e for the begin n ing of next week .
S le e p ing a l ot , w a k ing up l ate on S at ur day , w a k ing up as e ar ly as week day s on S un day . . .
I think I can keep good r h y th m for my life s ty le this way .
In J a p an before the end of every ter m , you will have a talk f est .

I like draw ing with a b a ll po in t p en
When I was a ch il d , I of ten us ed a b a ll po in t p en for draw ing .
The b a ll po in t p en is thus us e ful for me .
What I ' ve been think ing de e p ly about the se days
I ' m a so p h o m or e st ud ent , so I will have to de c id e what my life will be like soon er or la ter .
I see I ' m in a c a p it al is t ic so c i e ty , however , I do n ' t have the mo t i v ation to go job hu n ting next year .
I want to do something good for so c i e ty .
But comp an ies are n ' t like that any m or e .
I want to se ll v ir t u ous mind s again , and want to im p ro ve what they can do .
So , I made a comp an y de al ing with re c y c ling pro d u c t s . ``
I thought `` That ' s it ! `` I have consider ed whether I should work as `` a do g of c a p it al is m `` for a long time , but his commen t ga ve me a new idea .
I do n ' t have to work for a comp an y .
I can make a comp an y that ' s good for so c i e ty
I may work at a comp an y for a while , and then I will re t i re when I a c qu i re enough ex pe ri ence in business , then I will make comp an y or something like that .
S or ry if it was too long !
But now , it ' s us ed for sen i or high school b a se b a ll to ur n a ment s .
They never get a p ri z e or pay ed , even if they w in a ch amp ion s h i p .
But still they p r a c t ic e b a se b a ll very hard .
They fight in a to ur n a ment , if they los e a game , they c a n ' t fight again .
So they either become ha p p y or s ad after every game .
T h an k you for read ing .
If you finish ed a me d ical co ll e g e you have to be able to di a g no se this case .
I think it ' s a good idea to us e L an g - 8 to study English .

So when I p re p ar ed to go out , I found B e t ty ly ing still with her eyes close d in her house .
S ud d en ly I felt something strange , and she looked i ll .
I called her , but she did n ` t mo ve a m us c le , so I to u ch ed her head but she did n ` t open her eyes .
This was her first time not open ing her eyes after I to u ch ed her .
She did n ` t open her eyes ?
It was the first time after 1 0 year s and 7 month s of living with her .
A fter meeting my hu s b and , we stop p ed at an an im al ho s p it al .
What can I do ?
B e t ty ` s eyes ~ ~ ?
This morning when I went out I did n ` t find any so r t of pro ble m with her .

I know that a `` ga p `` is one of the most im p or t ant s fact or for me to be mo v ed , but it ' s not only the thing .
I felt a kind of p ow er , so ul , living en er g y , po s it ive way of express ing . . .
The way she s ing s made me think so , and she seemed to be very con f id ent to s ing and enjoy s ing ing and such .
I have been watch ing the v id e o for the last three days in a r ow .
I am at the comp an y at the moment .
I b or r ow ed the comp ut er of another e m p l o y e e in my office . She if like a s is ter . She would like to go home soon but I asked if I may write my di ar y for 3 minute s .
She r us h ed me a l ot so I must go home now .
I c a n ' t understand why the we a ther is like this in S p r ing .
In my me m or y , S p r ing always mean s w ar m we a ther , b l u e s k y , w h ite c l o ud s , and gr e en tree s , but much has change d .
The g l o b al c l im ate has change d much in the past year s because of hu man act i v it ies , includ ing the gr e en h ous e effect , po ll u tion and over - ex p l o it ation of re s o ur ce s , e t c .

D o you have any re c o m m en d ation s for sight se e ing in T or on t o ?
I w an n a talk with friend s more but I do n ' t know who to talk with .
It is good to think , study , walk and read by myself but that kind of stuff make s me feel so much more alone .
I want a so l u tion to this pro ble m .
I called my language school to change me m b er in my class .
She of ten i g no re s teacher ' s direction , c a n ' t stop talk ing about her s el f , and c a n ' t understand gra m m er . . .

But we are pay ed money for our work , and I can bu y anything for myself .
A l s o this time , To h o ku people are invite d for free and will sp en d more money for the re c o ver y .
I re ally than k for all people ' s help , and wish To h o ku people will have a l ot of f un at the conc er t ! !
However , now that I myself am a mother , I have to a d m it that I was wrong , because after watch ing my little bo y , I understand that you should n ' t in ter f er e with their ent h us i as m ( s ) .
They are little E in s te in s , to t ally free and always e age r to le ar n new things .

I do n ' t eat s n a c k s between me al s ever since to day .
If we have no one to l o ve , we try to find some on e we can l o ve .
We can tell when we do not have much l o ve .
We p r a y that we would l o ve each other more .
and show our l o ve to other s .
O ur effort s of ten le ad us away from the l o ve we see k .
We try , f a il , have re g re t and dis a po in t ment , then try again .
We have to a b and on s el f ish ness and gr e ed .
G r ow ing in l o ve is not by effort and re s o l ve .

We need G o d ' s help .
We went sh op p ing first .
My so n walk ed by himself every where , and he enjoy ed follow ing me .
There were many f a m il ies there .
My so n like d it there very much .
He enjoy ed the long s l id e .
He went on the ri d e many time s and he was so tired .
He was f in ally sat is f i ed and he s l ept in the c ar .
As an English le ar n er I have to de c id e what a c c ent I should a d op t .
In K or e a most of the ma ter i al s we can get are all A m er ic an style .
It see m s that many K or e an s consider A m er ic an English as the for m al stand ar d of English .
D ur ing W or l d W ar I I , the co l on a i z ation s of the U .
made English sp re ad all over the world .
But as I have been ex po s ed to a l ot of kind s of English on the ne t ,
a c ur i o s ity came up to me . I became c ur i ous .
I s having an A m er ic an a c c ent or a B ri t ish a c c ent re ally im p or t ant ?
How about the In d i an s ?
Even though they have In d i an a c c ent s they see m to be o k a y to work and live in A m er ic a or other English speak ing co un t ri es as me m b er s of so c i e ty .
I want you guy s ' straight answer s .
I enjoy ed p r a c t ic ing m us ic with some fellows .
The so ng we play ed is a f a m ous J a p an e se so ng that I ar r an g ed .
It is ra in ing outside now .
It has been a long time since it last ra in ed .
The ra in and he at the se days will en h ance the gr ow th of p l ant s .
F or ex amp le , the gra s s in our ga r d en is now turn ing gr e en .
However I had been writing my j o ur n al s on `` mi x i `` , the big g est S N S in J a p an an . It act u ally was n ' t a b l o g but only a di ar y that could be read only by my friend s and such .
It s ud d en ly came to me in the begin n ing of this month that I should sha re my ex c it ing ex pe ri ence s about my English st ud ies with far more people than I could do on mi x i .
I act u ally started study ing English last J an u ar y , and I ' ve been study ing English us ing the `` N at ive M e th o d `` since the l at ter half of last F e b r u ar y .
The me th o d f o c us es on the pro n un c i ation and tea ch es us that it de f in ite ly require s the us e of our th ro at , from the to p to the bo t t o m , to speak like n at ive English speak er s .
T h r ough study ing this me th o d and us ing my th ro at , I ' ve act u ally im p ro v ed not only my pro no un c i ation s k i ll s but also my listen ing ability
And I ' ve also got ten the en er g y to make a l ot of over se as friend s .
E s pe c i ally the se last four month s , I ' ve been try ing to make friend s with many for e i g n people on L an g - 8 and some other sit es .
M or e o ver I some time s re c or d con ver s ation s with such friend s v i a S k y pe .
A n y way I ' m enjoy ing my study with this me th o d so much that I name d my b l o g `` My T h ro at J o ur ne y `` , comp ar ing my interest ing ex pe ri ence of study ing English to a j o ur ne y .
I never knew about this we b sit e . My friend from the U S told me about this sit e and that I could po st anything here and people will f i x my sen t ence s ? C o o l !
I always get head a ch es !
But I get one every day .
Some time s the pai n is less , some time s it is great er .
A t this point un f or t un ate ly , I ' m a c c ust ome d to it .
I should probab ly see a do c t or .
A c t u ally , I also have a back a ch e , and de s p ite the fact that I w al k in the morning s ,
it does n ' t stop hu r ting .
I think I need to start a work o ut re g im e ; it ' s good for the body .
No t to be over ly m us c ul ar ( a pro f es s ion al body bu il d er ) , but just to ma in tain my he al th .
I am so you ng and yet f il led with so much pai n .
A re you interest ed in the new s ?
I do n ' t think you ng people in J a p an are interest ed in the new s .
I like watch ing new s on T V , and I think it ' s re ally im p or t ant to know the l ate st new s .
It ' s very difficult to understand all the i nformation , for ex amp le , po l it ical , e c on o m ic , and so c i e t al pro ble m s .
The other day , I was talk ing with some friend s and I was so surprise d !
Some of my friend s do n ' t even know who the the p ri m e mi n is ter is in my country .
I was re ally surprise d and sh ock ed .
I can understand if they are n ' t a w ar e of the more comp le x new s but it was just the p ri m e mi n is ter ' s name .
In J a p an , the p ri m e mi n is ter change s after a short ter m .
I do n ' t think this is good , and I get con f us ed .
It is difficult to to understand the new s and many people might think it ' s b or ing , but I ho pe more you ng people will pay at ten tion to the new s .
A n I m p or t ant L es s on
I was re ally surprise d when I heard an al ar m c l or k .
I was very bu s y .
I was tired .
But I have to p r a c t ic e the l ut e , for the conc er t will be in A p ri l . .

When I was in N e w Z e al and , there were many present s under the tree and ch il d re n open ed them at C h ri st m as .
That mean s they do n ' t p re p ar e a s ock next to their p i ll ow ?
It ' s thought that S ant a C la us es put s the present under the tree ?
I am look ing for w ar d to he ar ing it ! ! !

To day is my b ir th day , but just like every year , nothing sp e c i al or im p or t ant happen ed the who le day .

`` all me n want to c he at , n ic e guy s just try not to do it .
normal guy s just do it ``
because if I l o ve some on e , I do n ' t feel like c he at ing on him at all .
and my ex bo y friend said `` I do n ' t like c he at ing !
other w is e , I do n ' t w an n a mar ry any on e .
Yes ter day I le ar n ed something that surprise d me .
They said So u th and No r th K or e a are the same country on the K or e an ma p . .
So there is no b or d er , and only one c a p it al .
I was very surprise d .
No w , I think some K or e an people ho pe to un ite the two co un t ri es .
( A ) J a p an e se people must be think ing that it is difficult for those from other co un t ri es to le ar n the J a p an e se language .
( B ) J a p an e se people must think that it is difficult for those from other co un t ri es to le ar n the J a p an e se language .
It was a very interest ing place that has c le an a ir and there is a ri ver .
We enjoy ed dr in k ing and play ing a j a p an e se c ar d game called ha n a f ud a , which mean s f l ow er c ar d .
My favor ite country is In d i a .
I read a b ook name d ' a j o ur ne y to s k y - la ke ' ( ? ) by a k or e an write r .
A my s ter y of k im on o better - The K im on o My s ter y
I us ed the w or d `` my s ter y `` in the ti t le , but it ' s an ex a g g er ation .
It ' s just a question about the k im on o .
I w or e a k im on o s ever al time s as a kid and now I put it on for my job every day and so does every on e else at my job .
So I thought I was so f a m il i ar with the k im on o that I would n ' t have any more question s about it , unti l a f e w days a g o .
However , I was asked an interest ing question at work the other day , so I ' ll write about it here to day .
a guy stop p ed me and asked me a question : `` Why do you guy s have that round - sha pe thing behind your s el ve s ? ``
That day I had made my O b i so as to re se m ble a p i ll ow - like sha pe if it was see n from my back , and a round sha pe if see n from my side .
On the con t r ar y , I just thought `` No wonder he has a question like that . ``
So , feel ing mi s er able , I re p l i ed `` S or ry , I just do n ' t know the reason .
I ' ll find out la ter , but we us e this sha pe O b i to put me m o p ad s and to w el s inside . `` This is a b it of an off - the - mar k re p ly !
I know I in t ro d u c ed how to us e the O b i f un ction ally in or d er to co ver my sh ame at not being able to re p ly . ( I s this ma k ing sen se ? )
It was after a while when I le ar n ed the answer to his question .
S in ce I felt too mi s er able , I kept think ing about the answer , and f in ally I got to a simple answer : O b i is for hi d ing str ing s under the O b i and if you ti e both end s of O b i on your front , it ' ll get in your way .
Besides , if you leave O b i just ti ed simpl y , it ' ll be l o o se because the c l o th of O b i is b ro ad and th ic k , so it need s to be de al t with so that it ' ll keep in place for a long time .
There should be some other p at ter n s of ty ing the O b i , but I think the e as ies t one is us ed now a day s .
The b a b y b ir d s have gr ow n in the past four month s .
The last one is just f l o at ing with it s ne c k on it s back .
Yes ter day , I went to the p on d in the even ing .
But , the strong hot s um m er s un was sh in n ing in the s k y .
As soon as I ar ri v ed there , I started con f ir m ing whether they were living s a f e and sound or not , d u e to their in ability to f ly .
It was possible that they might be at ta c k ed by big g er b ir d s or s n a ke s as they were play ing .
This is probab ly the time when the reason able side of my bra in expect s to he ar something like ( I will never dr in k again , bo o h o o ) , but I l o ve v o d k a and I know that I ' ll find myself in ex a c t ly the same sit u ation a co up le of days / week s from now .
To day , a so c c er ma t ch ( J a p an v s J or d an , As i an C up ) was he l d .
J a p an made many attempt s to get go al s , but could n ' t w in .
He is very good play er , so he j o in ed the D or tm un d , G er man y tea m last year .
However , his perform ance was not as good for to day ' s game .
I expect him to get a go al next game !
Some of them are bu s y and some prefer stay ing at home in their free time .
In addition to this , some of them are sh y .
It would n ' t be an ex a g g er ation to say that this has been a ma j or reason why they have been s ing le all their live s .
As we get old er and old er , I think that it is become s more and more ur g ent to find B F by tak ing part in many different kind s of act i v it ies .
One of the bo y s I know , is my class m ate of the un ive r s ity .
A no ther bo y is hand s ome and s ing s quite well .
The un i qu e short c o m ing of this bo y is his he i g h t , honest ly , he is not that ta ll .
L ate ly , I have re al i z ed one r ul e from M an k i w ' s ten p r in c i p le s of e c on o m ic s which I re v i e w ed this after no on a p p l ies to people too - that is that people face tra d e - off s .
I also want to have a friend who se n at ive language is English .
U n f or t un ate ly , I can feel the coming of sp r ing with ha y
I want to go to a country where is no ha y f ever !
How I sp ent my week en d .
I did n ' t go out ex c ept when I need ed to get f o o d from the sh op s .
I w o ke up a little la ter than the week day s .
I c le an ed my room because it was me s s y .
I ir on ed some c l o th es .
I c ook ed a J a p an e se style ha m b ur g s te a k which con tain s k at s u o b us h i ( small piece s of s l ic ed dr i ed bo n it o ) and gra ted da i k on .
U s u ally when you eat hu m b ur g s te a k , you can us e de m i - g la ce and so on .
But in this case , I us ed so y s a u ce .
I did a l ot of study ing .
But , I think it is ne ce s s ar y to re la x o c c as ion ally .
P la y ing g u it ar
The se days I have been p r a c t ic ing the g u it ar for one hour a day .
H i g h ch or d s are so hard for me but my g u it ar play ing s k i ll s are in c re as ing ly get ting better .
However , I can only play one so ng that is very easy .
I ' m ha p p y when I play the g u it ar .
I ho pe to play so ng s that s y m b o l i z e K or e a ' s de m o c r at i z ation mo ve ment , es pe c i ally `` M or n ing D e w `` , `` E ver g re en ``
and the so ng play ed at R h o - M u - H y un ' s f un er al ce re m on y .
I re m e m b er R h o - M u - H u y n ' s g u it ar play ing and I was impress ed by his free and easy play ing .
M a y b e I gue s s that is why I started le an ing g u it ar .
It ' s the reason why I p r a c t ic e play ing g u it ar .
Even though I ' m s u f f er ing from lack of sleep , I did n ' t feel sleep y at work , but I ' ve been sleep y since I ar ri v ed home .
P er ha p s I will have a good to p ic to po st tomorrow .
They are s c at ter ed through o ut C A .
There are l ot s of M and ar in sh op s en c o m p as s ing the p la z a .
They se ll c he a p er f o o d s than other A m er ic an s up er m ar ke t s or even gr o ce ry who le s al es .
This is my second visit there since I want ed to be more as s im il at ed with A m er ic an s .
She work ed part time as a f o o d pro m o ter .
She had a stand to provide c l i ent s free s amp le s .
L i ke s up er m ar ke t s in T a i w an , they are always c r ow ed , hu st le and bu st le e v id ent every where .
I ho pe this week en d the s un come s out .
S or ry , I for g ot to write the re s ul t of the game that was very im p or t ant for us .
I was hu r t by a strong tea m , which is the to p tea m in my town .
I did my be st for the tea m .
But I could n ' t stand the dis c o m f or t from my le g s .
My le g had b ro k en before the game started .
I had thought about that for two week s , what I should ch o se for me and for the tea m .
F in ally , I de c id ed to keep play ing b a se b a ll .
My tea m m ate told me that `` You are a b n or m al and you should see a do c t or . ``
U n f or t un e t ur y , we los t the game , which I was respon s i ble for .
I ' m very s ad .
We had our mo d el ing de b ut ! ?
My so n and I visit ed my hu s b and ' s work p la ce yesterday to have our picture s take n .
The other day , my hu s b and asked me to have my and our so n ' s picture s take n for the home p age of his comp an y .
( In c id ent ally , my hu s b and works at an in ter n ation al hotel . ) E s pe c i ally , the p l an is for family . . . ? . , a ccord ing to him .
I did n ' t know why they and my hu s b and asked us to have our picture s take n , but I was rather interest ed in the request because I us ed to work there when I was a s ing le .
A fter all , I want ed to re m in is ce those days .
When we ar ri v ed at the place , which was a re st a ur ant , I was a little b it surprise d because all me m b er s of the s ta f f were new to me and the c a f e in ter i or was a little change d .
I felt a l ot of time had pass ed . . .
While the p h ot o g r a p h er was tak ing our picture s , my so n was n er v ous all the time .
But the p re s s office r s , who were in their 2 0 ' s , en c o ur age d him to re la x .
A fter that , I re la x ed over co f f e e and my so n at e a piece of c a ke with re l ish .
No w a day s there are a l ot of different kind s of mo v ies , for ex amp le , come d y , a ction and other s .
E a ch one has a sp e c i al and different s c ri p t and an ex c it ing story .
I ' m no ex ce p tion and I have a f a v o ur ite f il m .
I saw a mo v i e not long a g o which as t on ish ed me .
It was called `` T w i light `` .
I had heard a l ot of about it , but I had never see n it before
I like it because the story is f il m is very ro man t ic .
This mo v i e tell s you about re al l o ve , to which all girl s as p i re .
And when the 2 n d part of this f il m appear s in my country , I ' ll de f in ite ly go to the p re m i er e because I know that this part of the f il m will not dis a p po in t me .
I of ten read them , but because J a p an e se like to c or re c t , almost all j o ur n al s have been c or re c ted already !
R e c ent ly , I ( act u ally my mother ) found a new pro d u c t which is as us e ful as an um b re ll a in a ra in y day .
I ' ve heard that S U G I is a J a p an e se tree from some on e .
So , I j o in ed one of them .
The le c ture is a s er ies of 4 s es s ion s , and yesterday was the first day .
A n A m er ic an e m p l o y e e explain ed about their c ul ture in only English for one and a half hour s with his original s l id e show .
E ver y on e in the a ud i ence was J a p an e se .
A l th ough it was my first time to j o in the le c ture , it was very enjoy able !
I could understand more than 9 0 % of what he said .
I could understand his spoke n English
S in ce the le c ture was very c as u al , while we were listen ing to the J e f f ' s le c ture , I some time s could as k some question s in English
S in ce my T e x an friend is very good at speak ing about A m er ic an history , po l it ic s and re l i g ion s , I ' ve already heard much from him .
So , my question s were always good question s , and J e f f seemed to str u g g le to find good answer s .
I thought it is still difficult for J a p an e se English le ar n er s to hand le English when co m m un ic at ing with for e i g n er s .
One of the 5 who could speak English , spoke with a very strong J a p an e se a c c ent .
In addition to that , since he us ed so many big w or d s in his con ver s ation s , I could n ' t understand what he want ed to say most of the time .
I re ally think this is the kind of pro ble m J a p an e se have .
A l th ough to ex p and v o c a b ul ar y is one of the im p or t ant as pe c t s for language le ar n er s , it is more im p or t ant to speak every day e ng l ish that can be understood for every body .
P re s er v ed f l ow er less on
I went to a p re s er v ed f l ow er less on on F ri day .
It was so ti r ing for me .
It took about 3 hour s .
A c t u ally this class was the second time for me .
This class ' s them e was ' V al ent in e ' s day ' .
And for the sub - co l o ur I could se le c ted any f l ow er co l o ur s .
I se le c ted a i v or y co l o ur ed ro se .
It ' s a very ch ic co l o ur ! !
This p re s er v ed f l ow er will not be a g if t for some on e .
The ra b b it we ar ing gr e en c l o th ing is an easy - going guy .
They do n ' t speak at all but you can still understand what they ' re do ing !
I ' m going to write just a little b it because it ' s l ate ( for a school night ) , and I ' ve a ma th t est to re v is e for tomorrow .
I accept any on e , but I think it would be n ic e if we c or re c ted each other .
so if you are an English speak er who le ar n s F re n ch , you can a d d me , and I ' ll try to c or re c t your ent ri es when I can .
But per ha p s the people who will read this ent ry do n ' t want to a d d me or c or re c t me . . .
I saw S K Y L I N E
I saw a mo v i e yesterday , because I felt like see ing one .
My room m ate re c o m m en d ed `` S k y line `` .
I expect ed to go , and I was read y to see it .
It did n ' t start unti l an hour la ter .
It was very short and very dis a p po in ting .
M a y b e s k y line 2 will come ( out ) .
I have never see n it .
When I bu y something to eat in a s up er m ar ke t , it usual ly has an ex p ir y d ate .
But in some other co un t ri es , this d ate see m s to mean S ept e m b er 1 0 th , 2 0 1 1 .
What do you think about this , or is there any way to dis ting u ish when 0 9 . 1 0 . 1 1 is ?
I would like to in t ro d u ce J a p an e se c ul ture and how J a p an e se people think about certain to p ic s to people in your country .
It would help you to know J a p an .
H a p p y N e w Y e ar .
H a ve a good day every on e !
I l o ve M on day s the be st !
I am bu s y d ur ing the week en d s on business and the ch il d re n are ha ng ing around .
But to day , on M on day , they are back to school and I am here to write this while I am wait ing for te le p h on e call s .
It ' s a very quiet and pe a ce ful after no on .
And some time s I speak i ll of one of my co - work er s in front of them .
He p is se s me off .
But I like the other guy s .
B y the way , this year I am going to be an a d ul t !
My c ur r ent o c c up ation is e le ment ar y school teacher .
Some people say , `` T e a ch er s are l u c k y to have such long va c ation s . `` D o you think it ' s tru e ?
It ten d s to see n as wrong for teachers in J a p an to take long va c ation s because J a p an e se school s are suppose d to have three long va c ation s : a s um m er va c ation , a w in ter va c ation , and a sp r ing va c ation .
However , it ' s certain ly tru e that we can take pai d va c ation s more easily d ur ing this time of the year , where as we normal ly have difficult y tak ing days off .
M o st teachers have even a l ot of work un re la ted to students and some h ow str ive to make time to get everything done .
That ' s why I think the se va c ation s are im p or t ant and ne ce s s ar y for teachers to do the se things and have a change to re fresh our s el ve s .
R e c ent ly , I listen to a l ot of bo s s an o v a .
There are a l ot of different ch or d s .
But I c a n ' t f i g ur e out what the di f f er ence s are .
I play ed bo s s an o v a ' s m us ic in my room ,
and the at m o s p he re has dr a m at ic ally change d ! !
L i ke a c as u al b ar ' s at m o s p he re .
S t ud y ing and work ing is going well .
The a p p l ic ation which surprise d me the most was the G o o g le sea r ch ing s y s te m .
It can even re c o g n i z e the w or d s such as `` M a x w e ll B o l t z man dis t ri b u tion `` , which is a j ar g on in the f i el d of c he m is t ry .
( O f course , it s month ly co st is a little b it high er than other p h on es , but it re ally is w or th it . )
The comp an y I work for is C o f f e e be an s ro s ter .
I ' m the s up er v is or of the s al es de p ar t ment .
I like B a se b a ll . My favor ite tea m is the S e at t le mar in er s .
I us e s k y pe for English con ver s ation and T O E I C ma ter i al s as study ma ter i al s .
I had a p r a c t ic e for the v o c al en se m ble comp e t i tion to day .
I p r a c t ic ed for four hour s .
There is a dr ive through la un d ro m at near my house .
It ' s the name of the s c re en s a ver and b l o g access or ies de ve l op ed by U N I Q L O , one of the big g est and most f a m ous bra n d s of c l o th ing in J a p an . U N I Q L O C k a im s to sp re ad the bra n d name of the comp an y around the world .
U N I Q L O is a bra n d name ; it s c or p or ation ' s re al name is The F A S T R E T A I L I N G , est a b l ish ed in U b e c ity in Ya m a g u ch i p re f e c ture in the we s ter n are a of J a p an .
The U N I Q L O C K w on the G r and P ri x p ri z es in the C an n ne s C y b er L ion s .
U N I Q L O C K was p u b l ish ed about a year a g o , and is p op ul ar among g e e k s and people who are fashion conc i ous . It is know n as a very fashion able and te ch n ical s c re en s a ver .
I have us ed this s c re en s a ver for about a half year .
It s B G M is comp o s ed by F ant a st ic P la st ic M a ch in e .
He is one of my favor ite D J s , and that is another reason why I like this s c re en s a ver .
If you are interest ed in the se pro d u c t s , please down l o ad and us e them .
I think you will be surprise d by the m us ic and da n c ing .
If you want to know more about U N I Q L O C K in C an ne s C y b er L ion s , please see be l ow :
Even though some on e told me `` I will call you la ter . `` , they never called me .
It make s me so s ad and it ro b s me of my mo t i v ation ! !
M or e o ver , as time go es by it ' s get ting difficult to find an ar t ic le about hi r ing on the we b s ite .
S in ce I c a n ' t find a job , I have nothing to do every day .
I want to do something like volunteer or something for free in the English co m m un ity , but co ll e c ting some i nformation is difficult for me as well .
T w o days a g o , I cha ll e ng ed myself to get the L an g - 8 ra n k ing , `` M o st C or re ction P o in t s `` in a day , and I got 3 0 c or re ction s .
The reason why I stop p ed at 3 0 point s is because on a previous day ( 3 days a g o ) the one who got `` M o st C or re ction P o in t s `` in a day had 2 1 point .
T h us , I thought `` 3 0 point s would be good enough ! `` .
The next day , I c he c k ed the ra n k ing and re al i z ed my ra n k is 2 n d place .
F ur ther m or e , the person who got `` M o st C or re ction P o in t s `` in a day had 3 1 point s !
On ly one point ?
So , `` W ri te your ent ri es , please . ``
We have a meeting at 9 : 0 0 and we talk about what we should do that day .
We have a tea b re a k before l un ch time at about 1 1 : 0 0 .
It is about 1 7 : 0 0 after we have finish ed put ting away the too l s and tak ing a show er .
So we have enough time to enjoy do ing what we want to do such as c he c k ing the in ter ne t , watch ing T V , read ing or even sleep ing unti l dinner time !
The follow ing ent ry is my e - ma il to my friend s who live in F l or id a .
T h an k you R o g er and B e t ty .
I have n ' t been study ing English for a long time .
I ' m afraid my English has become w or se .

However , even if I have p r a c t ic ed English pro n un c i ation every day , I re al i z ed that I have n ' t become us ed to ble n d ing w or d s in sen t ence s .

So if you want to study C h in e se and your n at ive language is English , you can con ta c t me .
We can cha t on S k y pe .
If you live in the c ity of B e i j ing , C h in a , we can have a cha t in a c a f e .

Some time s it ' s not only because I am try ing to say it in English .

Yes ter d y I dr an k with my old friend in K o b e .
But he work ed over time yesterday so that I had to wait for him .
A fter that I could me e t him at around 7 : 0 0 p m .
It was the first time in almost 2 y e ar s .
I was very ex cited and talk ed with him over a l ot of be er !
I was comp le te ly dr un k and act u ally I do n ' t re m en b er what I talk ed and how I went home .
I have a l ot of the se bad sit u ation s .
E ver y time I dr in k be er or some al c o h o l , I always feel like going to Ka ro ke !
No I mean I could n ' t go there .
I should be care ful for not dr in k ing too much be er . . .
If some on e become s my friend , I will be glad .
F or p r a c t ic e , I w ro te a f e w sen t ence s .
I will try to c re ate a story now .
I went out to bu y some s n a c k s at mi d night .
I turn ed at the corner .
And E la in was there .
`` He y , what are you do ing here ? ``
E la in looked s up ri s ed .
I am in a hu r ry .
I have no time to explain . ``
M ar l ow e , you must be on the way to bu y ing l ot s of j un k f o o d . ``
And made a st if f face , p re ten d ing to be a ng ry .
`` I said you should keep your me al small , M ar l ow e ! ``
But at the middle of the night on a street , I did n ' t want to was te / sp en d too much time talk ing .
The se days , da ng er ous l ad s were s ne a k ing every where .
And at that time , a guy who was we ar ing a strange co l or ed c l o th came close to us .
And look over there , some on e look s strange is coming .
`` D on ' t to u ch me this way ! ``
I hi d E la in behind the she l ve s , and took out a co s h from inside my j a c ke t .
`` L ook at the guy ' s face ! ``
W i ll you help me im p ro ve it ?
I found your pro g r a m in the i T un es st or e last year .
E ver y time I he ar you talk about the im p or t ance of good f o o d , es pe c i ally for ch il d re n , I re m e m b er my j un i or high school teacher and what he said to our p ar ent s .
K id s need ed to b r ing b ent o ( p or t able me al s in con tain er s ) themselves for l un ch .
A l ot of people made b ent o at home , but there were also read y made b ent o so l d in va ri ous est a b l ish ment s .
I went to a public j un i or high school in a r ough are a of a big c ity , where many st or es so l d b ent o .
It was very con v in i ent , but at the same time , a so ur ce of an x i e ty for p ar ent s with te en age ch il d re n .
A t the or i ent ation for the new students and their p ar ent s , a middle a g ed teacher , who had much ex pe ri ence help ing students with pro ble m s , said to the p ar ent s ;
A ccord ing to him , he has never see n a kid who had home m ad e b ent o on a re g ul ar b as is going in the wrong direction .
If kid s get money to bu y b ent o in s te ad , it can le ad them in the wrong direction .
On sp e c i al o c c as ion s like the school ' s sp or t s day and f i el d tri p s , however , kid s need to b r ing their own b ent o .
The con t ent s of b ent o are of ten the left o ver s from a previous day .
As a mother of two bo y s with work , it ! s not an easy ta s k to make b ent o e ar ly in the morning ; but , re c al ling how my mother who was a way bu s i er than I am made b ent o for me on every school day , I am try ing my be st to do the same for my ch il d re n .
It was so b or ing in the morning that my family went to G w an g y an g c ity to bu y some K or e an hot pe p p er past es .
We had b ough t some this A p ri l but it had already been all eat en .
It was ra in y to day but we felt ex cited think ing about bu y ing K or e an hot pe p p er past e .
F in ally we me t the me r ch ant of it and b ough t as many as four t u b s .
I gue s s it will last for about six month s .
I asked for m us ic re c o m m en d ation s in my di ar y 2 days a g o .
I listen ed to the se re c o m m en d ed t un es on You T u b e after my work finish ed .
I will sleep after a bath .
I be l ive they ' ll los e .
I should think at my future !
When I was a high school st ud ent , I w or e a school un if or m every day .
But now I am a co ll e g e st ud ent . + ma z el t o v ! +
So , I must de ve l op my fashion sen se .
There was a D o ll ' s F est i v al , which is for girl s , yesterday .
P e op le display a set of do ll s and p r a y for the gr ow th of the girl s in family .
M or e o ver , display ing and put ting them away take a l ot of time .
He ll o , some time s I as k myself , what can I write here ?
To day I had a ( hard / difficult ) day , and I ' m very tired .
But I believe that G o d help s me all time .
I had s te ame d ve g e t able s and or g an ic w in e .
I usual ly do n ' t eat much ve g e t able s , but I can eat s te ame d one s .
T h o se are very he al th y .
I of ten sen d e m a il s to a for e i g n co ll e a gue at the head office in S ing a po re .
To day , I sen t an e m a il to her and ga ve a suggest ion to im p ro ve ri s k as se s s ment act i v ity .
She re p l i ed to me very quick ly as always and a p p re c i at ed my suggest ion very much .
To my surprise , she us ed e m ot ic on s at the end of her e m a il .
It may be difficult for you to j ud g e with only the i nformation a b o ve , but is it a sign that she has tru st in me or feel something f a m il i ar with me as a co ll e a gue ?
If so , I am glad that I am a little close to a for e i g n co ll e a gue for the first time .
P ut ting on make - up was original ly a thing done in a place hi d d en from the eyes of people .
What do you think about this ?
In this after no on , a we a ther new s re p or t on the ra d i o said , `` It ' s going to be ra in ing tomorrow after the ty p h o on is go ne . `` It turn s out that we can put out our la un d ry tomorrow .
I ' ve just return ed home from T a i w an .
T a i w an is my favor ite the be st place to visit .
A n y way I ' m going to leave for B an g k o k the day after tomorrow .

S um m er va c ation has started !
I at e sha v ed ic e , a b an an a ch o c o l ate , and a `` k ar a age `` .
I want s um m er va c ation to go on for ever !
The se days , the b ir th ra te of J a p an is dr op p ing and it is said that it ' ll f a ll under 1 . 0 per co up le in the future .
However , at the same time , the J a p an e se e c on o m y is in a s ever e sit u ation .
F ur ther m or e , the to t al p op ul ation in J a p an , es pe c i ally the work ing p op ul ation ra te is dr op p ing , f u el ing re ce s s ion .

A ccord ing to a s ur ve y , more than 7 0 % of J a p an e se w ome n who ga ve b ir th to a ch il d end ed up le aving a job .
To de al with this pro ble m , I ' d like to suggest a so l u tion .
That is , the comp an y has to show more understand ing and a pro g r a m m e for ch il d c ar e and ma ter n al we l f ar e has to be put into p r a c t is e im m ed i ate ly .
The pro g r a m m e should includ e set ting a n ur se ry room at the office which would en able mother s to take a ch il d into the office .
I w ro te this ent ry p re p ar ing for the writing part of the I E L T S .
So , if there ' s any w or d that is not us ed in B ri t ish English , let me know please .
I ' ll give it to my c l u b me m b er .

As usual , tell me whether it ' s c or re c t or not .
I was so ha p p y because I was so tired that I did n ' t have any thought s in my mind , it was re ally re st ful . I felt as though things could n ' t get better .
No ne th e less , I was very ex ha ust ed , and I was on the ed g e of pass ing out /
It seemed I am a l un at ic , do n ' t you think ?
Even t u ally , I for c ed myself to wall ow at 1 0 am in my be d for an hour or so .
And other sen t ence s which have nothing to do with my story , just so I can f it in some more v o c a b ul ar y of which I ' m not sure I ' ve m aster yet .
P ri or to mo v ing away from A m er ic a , he was always re ly ing on his pe er s , but now he is much more in depend ent .
D ur ing the ra ce , he was always on X ' s re ar , however hard he tri ed .
It took me a b a c k ; he us ed to be a great run n er
My job is being a s ta f f me m b er in a con ve n i ence st or e .
T h an k you for visit ing my di ar y .
And we stay ed in G er man y , F r ance , I ta ly and A ust ri a .

It ' s one of my dr e a m s .
W i ll you j o in us ?
I have n ' t written anything for a long time . There was something wrong with me .
Some time s , I said something to myself . It was all in my mind , but not every on e could have the same feel ing at all .
There were so many things happen ing around the world , and I ho pe that every on e will be al ri g h t . G o d b less .
My W a c o m G r a p h i re 3 t able t ( comp ut er draw ing too l )

A c t u ally I receiv ed an e - ma il to day from an English co - op er ation comp an y .
She said , I do n ' t understand what you mean . . .

My English less on will start tomorrow at a new school .
On my last month in the U K , I re al i z ed that I still need to study English .
There f or e , I de c id ed to change school to im p ro ve my English ability .
My new school is just close to my work p la ce and has a good en v ir on ment .
I ` m look ing for w ar d to le ar n ing English .
The a im of a s al es man is to de l ive r ha p p i ness to c ust ome r s .
They need to think about what the c ust ome r s re ally want .
They can understand c ust ome r s better by o b s er v ing them care ful ly .
They get more money by g i v ing c re at ive and va l u able so l u tion s to c ust ome r s .
They need to think more de e p ly about something from a different point of view
The se are some of the im p or t ant fact or s to be a good s al es man .
A fter I write my di ar y , I ' ll do T e ll M e M or e .
The B a se b a ll c l u b is off sea s on .
I ' ll study e ng l ish hard .
A t the end of last year , my bo y f ri en d ga ve me a present .
It was the b a g which I had want ed , so I was very ha p p y .
When I open ed it , my bo y f ri en d said `` please mar ry me ! ``
O f course , I accept ed : )
To day was a sp or t s day .
I was s c r at ch ed near my left e y e .
I write my first di ar y .
I ' ll in t ro d u ce myself first .
I am 2 3 year s old .
I like over se as mo v ies very much .
So that is why I ' d like to watch a mo v i e without sub t it le s .
B e c a us e I did st ud i ed English .
but English is being st ud i ed str en e ous ly by s el f - education .
I want you to tea ch me some s la ng .
S p or t s and C o g n it ive A b il it ies
In f a c t , she was the one who propos ed that we do it so e ar ly in the morning .
M o st of the people who he ar about our agreement think that we ' re c r a z y .
The pe a ce and quite , even in the heart of a big g er c ity , when every on e is still sleep ing and the b ir d s are just w a k ing up and start ing to s ing their beautiful me l o d ies is wonder ful . It is an ex pe ri ence which en ri ch es my life .
A t first I did n ' t see it that way d u e to the fact that I was dis t r a c ted by having to keep up the p a ce while run n ing . However , now that the run n ing has become second nature I ' m able to look around and enjoy myself .
I was in s p ir ed to start run n ing in the morning s by a short es s a y in one of the b ook s I read .
I ' ll s um m ar is e the con t ent by just point ing out the s c i ent if ic as pe c t of im p ro v ing one s co g n it ive a b il it ies by in c re as ing the b l o o d c ir c ul ation to the bra in it s el f . *
A l th ough you have to be care ful with this me ta p h or e I just c re at ed , it is no ne th e less a very co l or ful way to de s c ri b e the be ne f it s of j o g g ing .
I had nothing to do to day ex c ept a little home w or k . I had no a p po in t ment s either , so I could feel re fresh ed to day .
I ' ve settled down here and got over j e t la g , so I re al i z ed that I had been tired since coming to L on d on .
M a y b e I had n ' t felt tired because I had been n er v ous .
My ho st s is ter did n ' t have work to day so that she could take me to H um p st ed , where there were sh op s and c a f es and I felt that it was a so f is t ic at ed are a .
We did girl t al k in a c a f e over a c a p p u c in o and small c a ke s , which made me so ha p p y .
I w ro te a di ar y at L an g 8 for the 1 st time .
I finish ed a read ing se ction more than 2 0 minute s left d ur ing the t est .
A ty p h o on will get close r to O s a k a my home t ow n tomorrow morning .
I ' m afraid that a st or m w ar n ing will be is s u ed in my home t ow n .
I thought it would be a n ic e idea to write how I act u ally le ar n English , so you can us e my me th o d , too .
How am I im m er s ed in English ?
U s u ally , for as much time as I can , I try to s ur r ound myself with English .
It can be anything : po d c a st s , something to read ( b ook s , ar t ic le s e t c . ) , mo v ies , even m us ic or something else .
When I do n ' t know some w or d and I ' m not at home , I c he c k it in a di ction ar y and put it on t o a re g ul ar paper - w or d l is t .
If I ' m le ar n ing at home , I put new w or d s with their translation s direct ly into A n k i ( a paper - w or d l is t is n ' t require d then ) .
If le ar n ing is no f un and it ' s b or ing , there must be something wrong with it .
J ust as k me them in the commen t s .
I have to w a ke up e ar ly tomorrow morning .
A p rofessor might say something im p or t ant about the ex a m in the class .
P le a se tell me how to go to sleep when you are not feel ing sleep y .
The T O E F L speak ing se ction has ( con s is t s of ) 6 question s .
Q u es tion s 1 and 2 are in depend ent speak ing question s .
F or ex amp le one ' s l i k ing s ( like s and dis like s ) or ex pe ri ence s .
The ex a m in e es ( t est take r s ) have to express their opinion s and give conc re te reason s for them .
We have 1 5 second s of p re p ar ation time after the question s are read .
And after that , we have to answer them with in 4 5 second s .
H a ll o .
I ' m writing in a di ar y here for the first time .
I have st ud i ed English for more than 8 year s .
I b i k ed 6 0 mi le s , which was the long est course .
It includ ed a very long hi ll c l im b and down hi ll .
It was hard er than I expect ed .
It was a very fine day , and I saw a very n ic e view !
I re c or d ed a v id e o again to day .
C an I may b e say `` How are you being as a ch i e f in a new di v is ion ? `` , but it does not make any sen se here .
- > L o g ic has a very strong p ow er that per s u ad es any hu man being , but after all they c a n ' t live with only that .
The se picture s are of n ut s of s il ver v in e .
We us e the se for c r ud e dr u g s .
The se work on people who have poor c ir c ul ation .
I p ic k led them in a co l or less l i qu or and made f r u it l i qu or .
In 6 month s to a year this l i qu e ur will be read y to dr in k .
It ' s not quite ta s ty but good for your he al th .
Even the we a ther is bad .
No w a day s , I do n ' t know who I am .
It is too ti r ing for me
My first impress ion of him was not bad .
When can I me e t a re al bo y f ri en d ?
V o y a ir a H on d ur as en s ept i e m b re u o c t u b re .
I can re c or d myself speak ing in English , up l o ad it on You T u b e , and l in k it here .
I did n ' t want to say a p es s im is t ic thing because I believe in the p ow er of w or d s , but I can not help saying this .
I know why I could n ' t get even a job in ter v i e w , it was cause d by my lack of ex pe ri ence for this position .
I know it ' s not good a idea to a p p ly for a job that does n ' t f it my care er .
S t i ll I do n ' t want to work for the money , but how can I be so n a ive ?
I want ed to as k some on e to help me , but my be st friend transfer r ed to O s a k a and my other friend s work as usual , so I could n ' t depend on them .
A d d i tion ally , my P C s ud d en ly started be e p ing at the time of bo ot - up and would n ' t run .
If I could have said something through the In ter ne t , I might not have felt so l on e ly .
F or now it is run n ing .
I ' m so re l i e v ed because I can not a f f or d to bu y a new P C now .
My favor ite f i g ur e s k at er M a o As ad a mi s s ed all her j um p s at both her S P and L P .
We ( all of her f an s ) know she is try ing to f i x all her j um p s this sea s on because she a im s to get the go l d me d al at the next w in ter O ly m p ic s in So ch i .
So it is fine that her j um p s may not be st able at the moment .
M a o go es through her hard est sea s on .
I have been tak ing my school ' s ex a m s since yesterday .
I am tak ing another ex a m to day .
To day ' s ex a m is English ! ! ( To day s )

so I ' m p r a c t ic ing s ing ing the so ng `` ga ro ta de i p an e m a `` right now !
To day , my p ar ent s and I went to M at s us h im a which is one of the most f a m ous s c en ic sp ot s in J a p an .
I went to a b ook st or e .
So I went to a b ook st or e .
I ch o se `` s no op `` .
`` s no op `` is the name of the b ook .
I ch o se that because it was interest ing .
I like m us ic , but I c a n ' t s ing on ke y .
M a y b e it ' s a reason why my e ng l ish is poor .
( * _ * I s it a beautiful ex c us e ? )
I of ten heard that many girl s have no sen se of direction .
But it ' s un l u c k y no body say s that many girl s have no sen se of m us ic .
O ther w is e I would have a beautiful ex c us e about language .
P er ha p s a sen se of good m us ic indeed make s it e as i er for for e i g n language , but I do n ' t think the qu al ity of for e i g n language is l in k ed to m us ic sen se .
O ther w is e , m us ic i an s are language s ch o l ar s .
D o c , and D o c re ve al s that he in v ent ed a time machi ne .
The en er g y so ur ce of the time machi ne is p l ut on i um and he c a j o led it out of a ter ro ri st gr o up .
There f or e , they got re ve ng e and tri ed to k i ll him .
It happen s that M ar ty is there , so they also tri ed to k i ll him .
He tri es to es c a pe by get ting in the time machi ne and he tra ve l s through time to the past to 1 9 5 5 by ch ance .
But , In that per i o d , it is almost im po s s i ble to get p l ut on i um , so he can not go back to his own per i o d and so he tri es to go back some h ow .
F o x who play ed M ar ty is so co o l and I like M ar ty ' s father a l ot .
I have watch ed it more than 1 0 time s .
I ho pe that I can see a mo v i e that is great er than `` B a c k to the future `` some day : )
This is my first time to try write a di ar y in English !
2 week s have pass ed since I came to L on d on .
I ' m a c c ust ome d to my new life here , a little .
No w I live in an in ter n ation al dormitory , but I can not make any in ter n ation al friend s here because my room m ate is also J a p an e se . . .
How can I live my life to the full est . . . ? ! ! !
In those days , there was not a s ing le good English - J a p an e se di ction ar y in J a p an .
W h i ch p h r a se do you think is better and more c or re c t , or what di f f er ence s can you see between the two sen t ence s ?
It was e W or l d D i a b e te s D a y .
When I ar ri v ed at K y ot o st ation , I saw a b l u e to w er .
It is usual ly w h ite , because it was made t in the im age of a J a p an e se can d le .
On that day a l ot of bu il d ing s in the world were co l or ed b l u e !
I like J o h n , he ' s my be st friend .
We have been talk ing almost every day for more than one and a half year s .
We have similar per s pe c t ive on many things . I find that he ' s so funny and s m ar t .

I saw my bo y f ri en d this week .
O f course I l o ve my bo y f ri en d , but I mi s s J o h n some time s .
J ust before we talk ed , he put his me s s age for me in the cha t bo x , and it said `` I mi s s ed you . `` I was ha p p y about that he had thought in a similar way that I had .
It was only a week , but I felt like that it was so H is ash i b ur i .
I re ally ho pe he can find the right one for himself very soon .
My idea l house
My hu s b and and I went to a part y for my teacher ' s so n .
She b ough t a new co t t age re c ent ly , so she invite d gue st s to it .
It was a wonder ful la ke side co t t age !
The la ke is big and clear , and there is con ve n i ence are a .
It ' s a close to down t ow n so I think people can live co m f or t ably in this are a .
A l ot of gue st s enjoy ed ri d ing a boat on the la ke .
It ' s a U S idea l life !
so we will find a la ke side re n ted house now .
M a y b e it ' s difficult but I want to find an idea l house because we can not live in it
R e c ent ly , I have n ' t been able to make the time to write a di ar y on L an g - 8 .

There f or e , it is difficult for me to understand the story .
R e c ent ly at my job , my tea m has been & n b s p ; p re p ar ing ( for ? ) a n ation w id e even t .
But as you know , H 1 N 1 is going around every where and gr ow ing con t in u ally & n b s p ; w or se , so we were in the pro ce s s of c ance ling the even t .

S t i ll , I ho pe that what ever time change s , it will never change my heart .
E ver y girl think s that they are so f at .
So , all girl s say that `` I have been los ing we i g h t re c ent ly . ``
A c t u ally , I have ga in ed twenty p ound s in the last year . I ' m so s ad about this fact .
No w , I have made a big de c is ion to los e we i g h t .
I will go on a di e t and go without having dinner .
And I will ex er c is e by do ing y o g a and dance three time s a week .
S um m er is soon coming , and I need to los e we i g h t in a short time .
S um m er , I l o ve it , but I do not l o ve f at ! ! !
My ho b b y is read ing my s ter y b ook s .
I like E ll er y Q u e en b ook s .
I think he is the be st my s ter y a u th or .
Some day I want to be able to read ing English my s ter ies .
W i ll I re ally become able to read ?
U s u ally I think I am ha p p y to be b or n in J a p an .
But when I read a my s ter y b ook I wish I were A m er ic an .
The ra in y sea s on is here
In has been ra in y this week in H y o u g o , and the we a ther for e c a st say s it will be ra in y unti l this week en d .
E ver y th ing is hu m id and st ic k y .
But from this sea s on , ri ce and other p l ant s gr ow for the a ut um n ha r ve st time .
F or this gr ow th , it is ne ce s s ar y to ra in .
So people who are in J a p an feel un c o m f or t able , but wish for it to ra in .
When this sea s on pass es , it will be s um m er . It will be too hot to go to school , and ch il d re n will be on s um m er va c ation .
A fter I had finish ed , I l ent C D s at the T S U T A Y A .
A n e ar th qu a ke had happen ed again .
I have become e ar th qu a ke - sick .
I always feel like I ' m going to be di z z y x (
I gue s s a big e ar th qu a ke will happen to J a p an again ( in the near future ) .
I will take a n a p . l o l
It take s me 1 0 minute s to read one p age .
In addition , how long will it take for me to be able to read those j o ur n al s natural ly ?
In my opinion , in or d er to p re v ent such thing from happen ing , in c re as ing the number of pro c t or s is im p or t ant .
. I just at e dinner .
I had N a g as a k i C h amp on and it was de l ic i ous !
It is ve g e t able s and e b i in so up .
I like N a g as a k i C h amp on .
On ce un ive r s ity ex a m in ation s are over , students do n ' t have to study English .
M an y students ten d ed to stop study ing English after they got into un ive r s ity .
They did n ' t ne ce s s ar i ly ha te English , but I think there were ma in ly two reason s they stop p ed .
It is my first time to write my di ar y on this sit e .
My name is Y u k i and am living in A ust r al i a with my A ust r al i an hu s b and and two kid s .
I am going to have a L un ch time P ar ty with my J a p an e se w ive s friend s .
No w I have to go to w a ke up my kid s and hu s b and to get them read y for school and work .
No w , I ' ve tri ed the we b s er v ic e , S k y pe .
F ir st of all , I need to re m o ve my f e ar of speak ing in English .
I got an no y ed by the guy s at t it ud e .
The guy must have been a per ver t , I was sure about it .
This time , the E x - p re s id ent ' s mouth was t re m b ling .
W o ul d he s a y something ?
My m us c le s str a in ed expect ing .
But he also c o ul d just s ing st up id so ng s or ro ar like a w il d an im al .
I did n ' t know what this so r t of person would want to do , so I had to keep E la in and the sh op ke e p er away from him .
I watch ed the guy care ful ly , and felt E la in watch me from behind my back .
A fter a w h i le the E x - p re s id ent open ed his mouth .
H is speech was very s l ow .
I could catch the w or d `` G er d n er `` because his voice was quite hard to he ar .
I s `` G er d n er `` some on e ' s name ?
I was a little con f us ed .
A fter set t ling down in T a i w an for a while , I came to J a p an to job hu n t and study J a p an e se .
This is my second month in J a p an and almost everything is on the tra c k now .
My 9 0 day l and ing per m it quite an no y s me because I ' m not all ow ed to work here no matter how hard I try to find a job .
L u c k i ly , I ' ll be get ting the one - year st ud ent v is a by the end of this M ar ch , per m it ting me to work up to 2 8 h r s per week .
I w an n a start my care er in J a p an so bad ly , but what I had le ar n t from my M aster does n t re ally work out here co z comp an ies here see m to sp on s or n at ive teachers only , and what I ' ve got so far is just some te m p or ar y teaching job s .
That ' s better than nothing though @ @
I ' d like to make more and more friend s , so from now on I ' m go n n a write as many di ar ies as possible and make c or re ction s .
A n y way , I have only one more week before I leave to N e w Z e al and .
As some on e ' s already know , I ' m going to stay in N Z for half a year .
And I ' m p l an n ing to le ar n English , work there , and of course have a va c ation .
I ' m not sure what I need there and what I c a n ' t get there .
F ri day , I took a t est at school .
This t est was the last one for up p er in ter m ed i ate le ve l .
I of ten con f us e `` The future per f e c t `` , `` The future per f e c t con t in u ous `` and `` The future con t in u ous `` .
I made many ex amp le sen t ence s and tri ed to understand .
On the t est , I got one sen t ence wrong , but almost all of them were c or re c t .
But first , understand ing is very im p or t ant .
I pass ed the t est with a very good s c or e ! ! !
( A c t u ally , the t est would not have been so difficult , if I had been in the class every day . )
A fter the t est , we went to the p u b to ce le b r ate !
He has been teaching me since I started going to the school about 7 month s a g o .
A t that time , I could n ' t speak English well .
He had t aught me only t w ic e .
We did n ' t speak for a long time and then in No r ve m b er he became my teacher again .
He said my English was better than before .
It ' s difficult for me to comp ar e my English .
He ' s know n me for quite a long time .
I think we talk ed a l ot but I do n ' t re m e m b er much .
To m or r ow I ' m going to start a d v ance d le ve l class es .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to it ! ! !
T w o month s has already pass ed since I came here .
I ' ll stay here only 3 month s long er .
I do n ' t believe my English is im p ro v ing yet .
I have to study myself .
I wish I could speak English more f l u ent ly , we could co m m un ic ate with each other a l ot more .
That ' s why I study a l ot more ! ! !
The so ng ' s ti t le is `` D es er t R o se `` .
D es er t R o se is a name of a mi n er al .
( D o es this sen t ence sound strange ? )
( D o it sound like a de s er t is ri s ing ? )
( R o se is a name of a f l ow er . )
That sound s y um m y : - )
Yes ter day , I b ough t a G o d i e g o C D .
Then , I listen ed to it
P le a se listen to this so ng !
To day an idea hi t upon me in my mind . `` Why do the people read b ook s ? ``
I have never thought about it because it look s like a p h il o s op h ical question .
But to night I ' ll try to think !
In my opinion : The reason s people read b ook s are :
To ga in know led g e
To consider a b st r a c t things , p h il o s op h ical things or mathematics , and so on .
To just enjoy themselves , such as read ing a f ant as y no ve l .
I want to know a l ot of thing about the world .
That ' s a serious pro ble m , I think .
The character is t ic of hu man being s is that hu man s can think a b st r a c t ly .
M a y b e too much read ing cause s los s of ability to think . S ch op en ha u er ( the f a m ous p h il o s op h er ) also said that .
A fter all , we have to us e our bra in s and think while read ing .
I can read b ook s ra p id ly , but I c a n ' t think de e p ly in the mi d st of read ing .
D o es any body have idea s about read ing b ook s ? ?
If you have something , please commen t : )
I ' ve finish ed read ing all J a p an e se b ook s I got from home the other day .
So I ' ve de c id ed to read English b ook s which are e as i er to get .
It ' s k il ling two b ir d s with one stone ; I can study English and it take s much long er time to read than to read J a p an e se b ook s , which mean s I can s a ve money .
This is my very first time to visit this we b s ite .
My friend said that this is a re ally good sit e to p r a c t ic e English and make friend s .
There are some beautiful c l er k s there .
What should I write ? ? ?
My ma j or at my un ive r s ity was English , but I ' d like to ma j or in mar ke ting in E ng l and .
I ' m conc er n ed about my English s k i ll s for when I go to the U K .
I ' m not good at speak ing and writing .
So please c or re c t my j o ur n al and let ' s become good friend s !
This sit e is help ful to me , because I do n ' t have the op p or t un ity to write in English .
My e ng l ish is still poor , but I ' d l o ve to im p ro ve it .
I will go to the b ook st or e and b r ow se some b ook s .
My town has a big b ook st or e , so it ' s con ve n i ent for me .
So the sit u ation will probab ly get w or se tomorrow , and new s re p or t s say that the ty p h o on will hi t my are a direct ly , re s ul ting in more ra in f a ll .
The go ver n ment has already de c id ed to dis p at ch some un it s of the S el f D e f en se F or ce .
We had a re s er v ation for the hotel , so we c he c k ed in , and then went to the re st a ur ant called B u c a M ar i o .
It seemed that they were a f a m ous re st a ur ant , about 1 0 people were in the qu e u e .
I thought this was ra re in I ta ly to have a qu e u e for a re st a ur ant .
In c r ed i b ly , we had to c l im b about 5 0 0 s ta ir s to go there .
There were not any l if t s .
It was w or th c l im b ing all the way up there , we had beautiful view .
In this con ne ction , F ir en z e is f a m ous for the J a p an e se mo v i e `` R e is e i T O J o un e t s u No A id a ``
A fter that , when we were head ed to the P on te V e c ch i o , a you ng guy asked me to take a p h ot o for them .
I c ar ri ed out their favor with pleasure .
But the came r a did n ' t work even though I tri ed 3 time s .
While that was going on , my w if e took a p h ot o of them next to me with s m il ing .
You ng guy s are always in no c ence .
B o y s be am b it i ous !
We went to P i a z z al e M ic he la ng el o , you can see ent i re c ity from there .
M o st of them were co up le s and to ur is t s .
When we were in a n ic e mo o d with this beautiful view , we could he ar m us ic that was in a p p ro p ri ate to the place .
A street perform er was draw ing a picture listen ing to the m us ic .
I wish ed he would have draw n some where else .
This T u es day , I had l un ch with my co ll e a gue in a Y un N an ' s re st a ur ant which ma in ly se ll s ri ce noodle s .
S ud d en ly , an el d er ly man appeared in front of us , with a bu c ke t of re d eggs .
He put two eggs on our t able , and said to us that his w if e ga ve b ir th to a b a b y some days a g o and he would like to treat us to the f est i v al eggs .
We con g r at ul at ed him and a p p re c i at ed his eggs .
In some are as of C h in a , if a family get s a girl , the hu s b and treat s his friend s with re d eggs and if it is a bo y , the hu s b and treat s his friend s with the re d eggs with one black point on each of the eggs .
The se kind s of eggs are name d F est i v al E g g s .
My le c ture r is str ic t .
I think it would be a quite hard paper for me to s c or e high mar k .
W ish me a good l u c k .
I re ally do n ' t know how to p ar a p h r a se an ar t ic le . . .
It ' s quite hard for me because I know only a little v o c a b ul ar y . . .
A c t u ally , English is not a sub j e c t that I can do re v is ion . . .
so that , I do n ' t know what am I going to do now . . . .
D o you know how pai n ful it is
to have your dr e a m r u in ed by 2 c m ?
T h an k you for let ting me sha re my mi se ry .
I will go to a conc er t of L U N A S E A on C h ri st m as .
They will hold a conc er t which require s us to come we ar ing black c l o th es .
We a b s o l ut e ly have to we ar black c l o th es .
I went to the b ook st or e to bu y some of his no ve l s .
So I b ough t `` The B la c k D a h l i a `` at A m a z on . co m .
However , my p ar ent s does n ' t play in the water p ar k so l u c k i ly , our family receiv ed it .
We of ten go to this kind of water p ar k and hot springs but we enjoy ed at the water p ar k two straight days after so long .
I put on s un s c re en but the s un was so strong , I still got s un b ur n ed .
I feel pai n on my back and should er s es pe c i ally .
I do n ' t want to c ar ry my kid s on my back and I felt pai n on my should er when I f as ten ed my sea t be l t in the c ar in this morning .
What is The D if f er ence ?
D o you know the we b s ite , C or e t o ? ?
It provide s a kind of a u ction p l at f or m like y a h o o a u ction and e B a y , but it is a little different from sit es like those two .
The ma in di f f er ence is that you do n ' t need to sp en d money to get any good s from this sit e , because the ma in idea of the sit e is b as ed on b ar ter ing .
C or e t o could be an effect ive so l u tion to the ga r b age pro ble m s if more people us e the s y s te m .
No more c ry ing for ch o c o l ate s .
No more shout ing w h il st sea r ch ing for the w h ite be ad she was play ing with .
We are in a room on the second floor of my w if e ' s p ar ent s ' house .
It is a pe a ce ful , quiet and w ar m even ing on a n ation al ho l i day .
I just want to p r a c t ic e English in a long s il ence , which has s ud d en ly come to me ever since she f e ll as le e p .
Y e a h ! !
I just got home !
It was very interest ing !
I tri ed s ing ing one .
I was dr in k ing and s ing ing so ng s . . .
I enjoy ed it very much !
I ' m so sleep y !
However I w ro te yesterday ' s di ar y in English .
Yes ter day , I made In st ant R ame n for l un ch .
The to p p ing was e g g and sp ro ut .
The ta s te was M is o .
It ' s my favor ite f la v or .
Yes ter day ' s R ame n was very de l ic i ous ! !
I es pe c i ally l o ve R ame n , ic e c re a m , T en p ur a and so on .
So I eat ic e c re a m every day .
I l o ve S up er C up made at the M e i j i fact or y .
And feel so ha p p y every day - than k s for eat ing ic e c re a m .
What f o o d do you like ?
But then it di c on ne c t s , and re c on ne c t s again .
This sit u ation has con t in u ed many time s !
The in ter ne t also dis c on ne c t s some time s .
R e c ent ly , I have been so bu s y .
When you are bu s y , how do you study and keep your mo t i v ation ?
I need sleep to more to keep my he al th , but I also need to study English more .
I am p l an n ing to go to English school to study business English for my job .
I thought I would have a good life s ty le in S ing a po re , but in fact I am work ing hard very hard every day .
I did not want to watch such dis g ust ing mo v ies , but I am very a honest and since re person , so I o b e y ed his or d er .
I watch ed them for around 2 hour s .
But tra g ed y s ud d en ly str u c k .
A dis g ust ing se x p op - up s ud d en ly came up on the P C ' s back g r ound .
I thought it was just an or d in ar y p op - up .
The se x p op - up seemed to dis a p pe ar , but 1 5 second s la ter , it came up again .
I made a big mistake , I p ic k ed up a dis g ust ing sp y w ar e from J a p an e se p or n sit es .
If I c a n ' t find way to de le te this sp y w ar e by morning , my l and la d y is going to find it .
If she does , she will k ic k me out of this house .
So , I de s p er ate ly sea r ch ed for a way to de le te it .
My l and la d y c a n ' t understand J a p an e se , but her nephew is a in ter m ed i ate J a p an e se speak er , so he might be able understand this p op - up .
One of them ga ve me some hi n t s on how to de le te it .
M o st S ing a po re an friend s laugh ed at me l and said `` You per ver t , How c he e k y you are , This is not your P C but your l and la d y ' s , Why did you do that ? `` .
M or e o ver , my l and la d y ' s P C c a n ' t ty pe J a p an e se , I could not sea r ch for i nformation about it .
I like He ll o K it ty very much ,
I just like that she do n ' t have a mouth . . . .
B e c a us e she us es her heart to co m m un ic ate , and there f or e does not need to co m m un ic ate through any kind of language .
A n y way , I start to us e this sit e though in an a w ful sit u ation
L ot s of pro ble m s happen ed one after another since a f e w days a g o .
So J a p an e se go ver n ment made a de c is ion to stop pro v id ing e le c t ri c ity in Ka n t o dis t in c t , even includ ing the c a p it al c ity , from tomorrow .
A fter s h ock s are happen ing f re qu ent ly even now .
I tri ed im a g in ing our life in J a p an after tomorrow , We will be de f in ite ly in a different world from now on .
We must also be strong er than we are now and we need l ot s of help .
I ho pe to get to know many people on here .
If some body is interest ed , just j o in me !
To m or r ow , I am going to No r th C ar o l in a for a business meeting that is he l d in ter n ation ally every two month s since last year .
The meeting s have re c ent ly been he l d in E ur o pe , and I mi s s ed the last one which was in the U S A .
So , it ' s act u ally the first time I go to the U S A for this meeting .
It has been almost five year s since I went to the U S A .
It ' s ex c it ing , and I want to shout `` We are the un it ed state s of A m er ic a `` , though I am not .
F or a g en er ation such as mi ne , the U S A was sp e c i al when we were ch il d re n .
R i ch , a d v ance d , great , de m o c r at ic , and free , all which we , J a p an e se , a d m i re .
I have been to N Y , N J , F l or id a , and H a w a i i , all of which are f a m ous c it ies for tra ve ling ex c ept N J .
My old er s is ter once live d in N J , that ' s why I went there .
A n y way , I am look ing for w ar d to going to a c ity where I have not been .
I like sp or t s ( es pe c i ally k ar ate , t able ten n is ) , and I also like t r a ve ling , f il m s , and p h ot o g r a p h y .
I receiv ed a letter about a c en s us re c ent ly .
The B ri t ish one is much more sp e c if ic than the J a p an e se one .
I ch o o se to do it on line because I thought it would be much e as i er and quick er .
It took me more than half an hour .
And I could n ' t finish it because my P C was free z ing up at the last se ction .
I was almost done .
She did it by writing .
I would like to do so too .
I want to qu it s m o k ing .
To day is S U C H A pretty day in K or e a .
good S U N s h in e and A good w in d ma K e me ha p p y enough .
It ' s about c i g ar e t te S .
I know c i g ar e t te S A R E B A D F O R M E .
But It ' s hard for me to qu it .
A n y way , T O G E T i nformation about T H E good effect s T H A T C O M E F R O M qu it ting s m o k ing , I go o g led I T .
On the In ter ne t , There are a l ot of st or ies about c i g ar e t te S .
F or ex amp le , In T H E U S , F e m al e s m o k er S A R E about 2 1 % , but In K or e a , about 4 5 % .
I gue s s it ' s A N im p or t ant in d ic at or .
As you know , there are many reason s F O R that big ga p .
S u ch as the p ri ce of it , T H E str es s of each n ation ' s p op ul ation , education , e t c .
N E V ER T H E L E S S , T H E sit u ation in f l u ence s hu man ' s be ha v i or , A N D we ( K or e an S ) have to over c ome it .
( A m I writing this c or re c t ly ? )
I want you to c or re c t my poor te x t right then I ' ll try to do anything as a le ar n er A N D U S E W H A T I ' V E L E A R N E D
The se picture s were our p h ot o s .
Yes ter day we perform ed a big show to all the students in our school that has about 3 0 0 0 people ^ ^
In my me m or y , he was always great , pro m in ent le ad er who never ga ve in .
He was always bu s y with his job , but he treat ed e a ch me m b er of his family like other or d in ar y f a m il ies while he was home .
He had to per s u ad e to his d aught er that they could n ' t play in the am us e ment p ar k ex c l us ive to w h ite people , or to explain to his w if e why he made a de c is ion not to p re s s charge s against the ra c is t ' s at ta c k .
I gue s s his f le x i ble str e ng th was s te ad i ly ro ot ed in his family .
P le a se do n ' t mi s s view ing this p h ot o es s a y .
As there was nothing to do , I sat down at my person al comp ut er , p ow er ed it and l in k ed it to the in ter ne t ne t w or k .
When I was look ing up my G M A I L bo x , I found my friend P e ter C o ll ing ri d g e was on line so I said he ll o to him and he soon re p l i ed .
D ur ing the con ver s ation , I found that he is very interest ed in C h in a and C h in e se c ul ture .
He felt it was very difficult to id ent if y so many new C h in e se w or d s and to understand so much C h in e se c ul ture , but he change d his mind to a great ex t ent about C h in a as a country .
He said it was very interest ing and that he was e age r to tra ve l to C h in a in his free time .
O h , now I do n ' t have anything to do unti l tomorrow .
So I would like to write my impress ion s of English , A ust r al i a , e t c .
P e op le who have t at t o o s were regard ed as `` Y A K U Z A `` ( J a p an e se ma f i a ) by other people in J a p an .
The t at t o o s most A ust r al i an s have are old English pro ver b s or w is e saying s ; I do n ' t know why but most of them are b l u e .
M o st A ust r al i an s do n ' t live in the c ity .
They do n ' t like c r ow d s of people , so they live in the sub ur b s .
On ly for e i g n er s , As i an people in particular , live in the c ity .
And there are pretty big C h in at ow n s in the c ity , and I was be able to he ar only M and ar in there .
If there were not C h in at ow n s in the c ity , S y d ne y would not be so act ive .
O f course , the se kind s of town s are in J a p an and A m er ic a .
If you are in J a p an now , I re c o m m en d you go to `` Y o k o ha m a `` .
You will be able to see it s hu g e and beautiful C h in at ow n .
T h o se dis t ri c t s are not like J a p an , but like C h in a as well .
You can eat ta s ty C h in e se f o o d as much as you want , but it ' s pretty ex p en s ive .
P ri ce s are pretty ex p en s ive in S y d ne y .
I had thought the co st of living in J a p an is the most ex p en s ive in the world before I came here .
But A ust r al i an p ri ce s are almost the same as J a p an e se p ri ce s .
I ha te the English ar t ic le s y s te m s .
So when a ver age J a p an e se students study English , we are always s u f f er ing from the se de v il s l o l .
If English speak er s study J a p an e se , is it difficult for them not to us e the ar t ic le s y s te m ?
C a n ' t English speak er s re al i z e the J a p an e se no un ' s own er ?
C a n ' t they understand which J a p an e se no un it ' s ( ? ) talk ing about in each J a p an e se sen t ence ?
I am writing a di ar y for the first time .
He ll o , I ' m s ant ar o u . I live in J a p an .
I am writing a di ar y for the first time at la ng - 8 .
I c or re c ted some people ' s di ar ies a little while a g o .
c or re c ting di ar ies was so interest ing for me .
No w I will in t ro d u ce myself .
I ' m n at ive j a p an e se .
I ' ve been study ing English re c ent ly , p re p ar ing for To e ic / To f le t est s .
T h an k you for read ing .
I like going a b ro ad .

I at ten d ed an a c ad e m ic I T con f er ence , which is called I F I P , in P o l and when I was a un ive r s ity st ud ent .
W ar s a w in P o l and is very f a m ous for ho st ing the In ter n ation al F ry d er y k C h op in P i an o C o m pe t i tion .
We went to a re st a ur ant for dinner with four people and in ten d ed to or d er a s ing le p i z z a which would be sh ar ed ( between us ) .
However , to our surprise , four p i z z as were serve d !
P o l and ' s p i z z as were so large , we could n ' t clear our p l ate s .
This ex pe ri ence made me take the co m m un ic ation difficult y to heart .
This is my first day and first po st on L an g - 8 , so I ' d like to explain where my n ic k n ame came from .
I ' m called S u e C h an by my p ar ent s and friend s because `` C h an `` is wide ly us ed as a s u f f i x for you ng girl ' s name s in J a p an .
You can us e it for both the s ur n ame and the first name .
I think `` S an `` is a c k n ow led g ed as an English w or d in business scene s .
H a ve you heard of the ' F r a p p u ch in o effect ' ?
How of ten do you dr in k co f f e e in a day ?
D o you think that co f f e e can affect your sleep ing ?
The reason is that B r a z il is ma x im um co f f e e co un t ri es of or i g in from the world . ( ? )
In fact , E th i op i a is the home of the co f f e e p l ant .
I do n ' t know about the different kind s of co f f e e .
No , I have n ' t heard of the ' F r a p p u ch in o effect '
Some time s I would dr in k co f f e e while study ing for my ex a m s .
Yes , I think that co f f e e can p re v ent sleep .
I know this from / through ex pe ri ence .
W o ul d you please c or re c t my comp o s i tion ?
B e c a us e to day is W h ite D a y in J a p an .
It ' s a day for return ing a present to a person who ga ve me a present on V al ent in e ' s D a y .
My c at ' s name is F e m t .

We f ed her .
But she said , `` G o o d b y e `` and dis a p pe ar ed .
My family l o ve s c at s more than do g s .
W h i ch do you like , c at s , do g s or both ?
L ate ly I have been think ing about how my life will be in the future with my family and friend s .
I read some b ook s that said people who has mar ri ed to some on e but have n ' t had a ch il d yet are called D I N K S !
In regard s to that , we are D I N K S !
It ' s a co m f or t able life to live , because we have some free time with each
other and in terms with co st , it ' s good !
I am c ur r ent ly watch ing `` A m er ic an I d o l `` on T V .
My favor ite is J as m in e M ur r a y .
To day I came a cross another so ng she s an g , `` R e f le ction , `` and it was great as well .

It was very co l d in K o b e yesterday .
So , many people must have c aught co l d .

The a ir is c le an in As a h i k a w a .
There are four people in my family .
S e c on d , one of my ho b b ies is listen ing to m us ic .
The so ng s that this b and make s are very good .
L a st , my p l an for the future is to get mar ri ed .
A fter I get mar ri ed , I want a ch il d .
This is the first time I have written a di ar y on line . I am 2 5 year s old now .
I ' m a girl who live s in J i an g x i province of C h in a and st ud ies in W u h an , ma j or ing in in st r u ction al te ch no l o g y .
I like to watch A m er ic an and J a p an e se dr a m as .
My favor ite dr a m as are friend s and H ous e M . D .
I l o ve mo v ies too , my favor ite star is j ame s s te w ar t , I think he is very cha r m ing in the mo v i e `` It ' s a W on d er ful L if e `` .
I do n ' t have many friend s , I do n ' t feel bad when I ' m alone , but some time s I feel l on e ly .
so from now on , I want to me e t more friend s , we can sha re good and bad things and find our co m m on interest s .
It ' s the last week before my ex a m s start s .
I am p l an n ing to go to O k in a w a with my co ll e a gue for G o l d en We e k .

My favor ite thing is m us ic . I am le ar n ing m us ic now ; the m us ic that I am le ar n ing is class ical m us ic .

This is one of my favor ite me l o d ies .
He is one of the people I get in s p ir ation from .
I was l ate to work this morning ,
because I had a dr e a m last night . In my dr e a m I told my B F that I had a dr e a m about him .
A dr e a m in a dr e a m , what a c r a z y thing .
So when I w o ke up , I re al i z ed I was l ate .
The good new s was that there was no meeting to day , so I just s l i p p ed in .
O h , I re m e m b er that I c ook ed last night .
What do you think about w ome n who take their care er s serious ly ?
A woman who set s a go al in her business life , and a woman who s n if f s around for a possible can d id ate for her future hu s b and .
As u may or may not know , J a p an is not or i ous for it s p r ed o m in ance of me n over w ome n .
But , I could not help but wonder what it would be like if we started to work like me n .
We can be like pe ng u in s who de l ive r f o o d to their b a b ies in turn with their ma te s , or like tra d i tion al J a p an e se mother s who c le an , was h , c ook and work part time .
I now see my m um who is tra d i tion al n a g g ing and y el ling about my f a il ur e and a ch i e ve ment .
but I do n ' t want to be st u c k in a house c le an ing , was h ing and b la b la b la all day long . .
D o you think I am a s el f ish b it ch ?
W h i ch kind of g ir l s do u prefer ?
C an you give me some fee d b a c k ?
l have le ar n ed English for many year s in C h in a .
I can read e ng l ish new s p a p er s easily and listen to simple sen t ence s .
But it ' s difficult for me to talk to some on e f l u ent ly .
also , I c a n ' t write di ar y with c or re c t gra m m er .
My friend s , can you give me some fee d b a c k ? T h an k s a l ot !
A co f f e e serve r came ! ( like F M L )
When I got to the office , I s m el t the a ro m a of co f f e e .
Some on e made co f f e e and dr an k all of it .
A re people a ng ry with the re s ul t s of the sp e c i al is t s ' dis c us s ion s ?
G e t ting to know T a i w an ' s night m ar ke t s
I know l ot s of people are interest ed in le ar n ing about T a i w an ' s night m ar ke t s .
may b e in the next day or two you ' ll see T a i w an ' s night m ar ke t s .
P le a se c or re c t this for me :
W h i ch one is right ?
- She at e up all of the c a ke s before before I knew it .
- He r English will be get ting better before you know it .
- My p en dis a p pe ar ed before I knew it
O k , I ' ve had English class es at school , and it help ed me a l ot , but it was most ly f o c us ed on writing and ma k ing t est s , nothing much like `` re al life `` .
My English education was be s ed ma in ly on m us ic and v id e o game s .
= P ) and I always had con ta c t with English w or d s , even when it was only `` S t ar t `` and G ame O ver `` .
I ' m still impress ed how comp le x some ly ri c s can be in he a v y me t al , having w or d s that I do n ' t see very of ten - and some ly ri c is t s are no n - n at ive English speak er s , what impress es me more .
No w , conc er n ing my study of English - language c ul ture , I ' m more interest ed in mo v ies and T V s er ies .
l am M a h i . I ' m a J a p an e se e ng in e er .
I ho pe I can speak and write English , and co m un ic ate with some people !
This even ing , the ra in was dr op p ing f a st in my town .
T h un d er ro ar ed in the ne i g h b or h o o d .
There was a f e w minute black o ut , because there was a p ow er / e le c t ri c ity in ter r up tion in my house .
A fter a while , the ra in stop p ed .
I saw the mo on through the c l o ud s .
My ho st family was so kind , so I have never for g ot ten them .
H o st mother was mi g r at ed from N e ther l and s and got mar ri ed to K i w i man . She had three ch il d re n .
However , when I stay ed with her , she had di v or c ed and live d with one of her d aught er s and two c at s .
I had one be d ro o m with a desk to study and close t .
I usual ly had me al s with them .
He r English was very clear and also she se le c ted easy English w or d s which I understood , so I was re ally ex cited to understand what they said and to us e English .
H o st mother some time help ed me read English b ook s , I read al o ud the b ook s . If my pro n un c i ation was wrong , she c or re c ted them , and when I did n ' t know the w or d s , she explain ed them in easy w or d s .
I felt my English got better than when I was in A u c k l and .
To day , I watch ed a do c u ment ar y pro g r a m on T V .
I do n ' t know whether not the view of ho st s are different a b ro ad .
I also think that way .
I th o g h t we must not look at them with p re j ud ic ed eyes .
H i ll
Yes ter day , I went mo un tain c l im b ing with my da d d y .
We us ed to do mo un tain c l im b ing before I went to A m er ic a .
In fact , T a i pe i is a b as in so there are great number s of hi ll s we can c l im b .
This time , we ch o o se a mo un tain called `` B i - S an ``
It is not very high and the walk ing p a th s are not long so it s u ite s the sen i or c it i z en to c l im b very much .
There were two p a th s c ir c ling around the mo un tain .
M a y b e , my father has not c l im b ed hi ll s for a long time so I could he ar him ga s p ing .
It was w or th it
To day , I have a less on in H a w a i i an H ul a .
I ' ve been le ar n ing for about 5 year s .
The gentle mo ve ment s and hand mo ve ment s are very beautiful and at t r a c t ive .
R e c ent ly , I started to le ar n the T a h it i an dance .
My father dr o ve to the b a se of the mo un tain .
I know that it come s from a f a m ous J a p an e se c ar t o on and was re m ad e as a so a p in J a p an and T a i w an already .
But , after I saw the dr a m a with friend s , I became h ook ed on it . ^ ^
A l th ough it includ es un re al is t ic sit u ation s , and is some time s hard for me to understand , the ma in act or s , who are called F 4 , are go r g e ous and I c a n ' t [ find a reason to ] object to it s p op ul ar ity
I have a l ot of home w o k to do this week .
I ' m worry ing whether I can do it by the de ad line .
But I must .
No t J a p an e se m us ic .
So , if you have any m us ic re c ome n d ation s , please tell me ! !
something is wrong with my S k y pe mi c .
I am us ing it for the first time , so I have some question s about it .
A fter I down l o ad ed and f i x ed it , my mi c work ed the first time , but the second time it did n ' t work , when I t est ed it .
I c a n ' t wait for this to end .
It is a t ough month at the un ive r s ity , but there is nothing to do about it .
This b ar cha r t i ll ust r ate s the number of p ri s on er s in G re at B ri tain , A ust r al i a , N e w Z e al and , the United States , and C an ad a from 1 93 0 to 1 9 8 0 .
As we can see , for B ri tain the t re n d d ur ing the fifty - year per i o d is up w ar d ; the number of p ri s on er s in c re as ed from about thirty th ous and people to just a b o ve six ty th ous and .
This is the only sit u ation that show s a s te ad y ri se .
The number s for the other co un t ri es f l u c t u ate .
F or in st ance , in A ust r al i a the f i g ur e of im p ri s on ment d ropped to about fifty th ous and people by 1 94 0 .
However , after this there was an in c re a se unti l 1 97 0 and then again a de c re a se to about the same f i g ur e as in 1 94 0 .
O ver a ll , for A ust r al i a the sit u ation with c ri m e has im p ro v ed , going from se v ent y th ous and p ri s on er s to fifty th ous and , as with N e w Z e al and in g en er al ( from one hu n d r ed th ous and to a p p ro x im ate ly n in e ty th ous and . )
The same t re n d can be see n in C an ad a ; the number de c re as ed from one hu n d r ed twenty th ous and to about n in e ty th ous and in m ate s .
In con t r a st , in the U S A the f i g ur e of im p ri s on ment has in c re as ed dr a m at ic ally , end ing with one hu n d r ed for ty th ous and .
When I go out , I take a b ook with me to read when I have some free time .
I some time s read b ook s at my house .
My so n who is 2 year s old will p re ten d to read b ook s like me .
O f course he c a n ' t act u ally read the character s / w or d s .
It is funny .
To day I took an ex a m .
That t est was not difficult .
So , I think I pass ed the t est ! ! !
I ' ve been very bu s y , l ate ly .
My job is to do in ter i or de s i g n draw ing s .
I ' m all around * w *
But the re s ul t in c re as es my work l o ad . . .
So , I become bu s y .
But I ' ve been very sub st ant i al at my work
A man ' s thing is to respect the J O B .
This sit e K el ly in t ro d u c ed me to is just a w s ome !
I wish I had know n it before I went to A ust r al i a .
A f e w hour s a g o , I w ro te that I was n ' t that ha p p y to day .
The we a ther outside was kind of dark and I was n ' t feel ing very well .
But now I think I m feel ing much better .
No w - a - days , , I think I m so r t of was ting time too much .
I c a n ' t be both er ed do ing A N Y T H I N G !
No w that I ' m tak ing a se m est er off , I always w a ke up and stay up l ate .
A day does n ' t go by without watch ing T V for at least 2 hour s .
take a n a p some time s which make s me not be able to sleep at night and then I end up w a k ing up even la ter .
the next day .
A t least , I work now as an English p ri v ate t ut or .
It is n t all that hard to get a job as a t ut or in K or e a B T W .
A n y way s , even though I ve got a job , I m not that bu s y .
The point is , I C A N ' T wait to go back to un i v .
I ' m de s p er ate to be bu s y !
D : I do n ' t have any pe t s , but I want a C h i h u a h u a , a M al te se , and a Y or k s h i re T er ri er .
gr e ed y are n ' t we ?
P in k y , B l u e y , and F l ound er , They all di ed .
name d M o m o , and she was 2 2 .
And then , she just di ed of old age .
And that was my first w or d M o m o .
He was 1 2 , and he got c aught in the ga r age .
C : M a y b e we ' ll take a b re a k not get do g s for a f e w year s .
It sound s like we ' re having some bad l u c k with the pe t s .
But I want those re ally bad .
well , my M o m , she like everything like c le an and stuff much like me .
I have n ' t done good in that are a with do g s .
C : She w o n ' t get it in the do g s ?
On my C h ri st m as l is t
I said on my C h ri st m as l is t
put stuff M al te se , but would p re f f er re al .
C : D id she read that she listen ?
I did n ' t get a stuff ed one !
She was di a g no s ed with a he al th pro ble m re c ent ly .
I am sorry that I can not a c c o m p an y her when she is feel ing s ad .
L u c k ly , the black S un day is go ne so I can for g e t this .
So I de c id ed to write this down to re m e m b er for ever .
I should keep a re c or d of my body ' s a il ment s .
And more so , even though I am afraid of the ho s p it al , I should go if something bad were to happen .
I am a bra ve girl .
I would a p p re c i ate it if you could c or re c t my sen t ence s .
I find J a p an ' s s um m er we a ther dis a g re e able because of it s high hu m id ity and te m p er a ture .
So , as the w in ter is coming , I ' m start ing to feel better .
It is a very ex c it ing sea s on .
But , before enjoy ing those kind of ha p p y time s , I have to do a kind of b or ing ,
I had f un b ow ling with my family to day .
My s c or e was 1 1 0 .
I am afraid of that I will have m us c ul ar pai n tomorrow . . .
I talk ed with friend in English on s k y t al k yesterday .
But I only could speak English a little .
And I could n ' t say what I want ed to say in English .
I went to dr in k with some co w or k er s yesterday .
They said some n ic e things to me .
One of them said , `` You have a very kind heart . ``
One of other s said , `` I like you very much . ``
And one of other s said , `` I was help ed by you many time s . ``
I had a re ally good time with my co w or k er s .
I have a d ate with an A m er ic an who is very good at J a p an e se to day .
I ' ve already know n my s c or e on the we b sit e , but I did n ' t know the de ta il s .
It does n ' t matter , but I not ic ed that my s k i ll that understand s short con ver s ation , an no un ce , n ar r ation or like that ha s im p ro v ed .
A l th ough my s c or e was l ow er then I expect ed , I ' m glad to know it .
I believe if I p r a c t ic e hard and keep it every day , I ' ll pro g re s s into the next le ve l .
I need p r a c t ic e , p r a c t ic e , and more p r a c t ic e !
I saw the beautiful s n ow , but te m p er a ture go down .
R e c ent ly my ma il bo x has been j ing ling with in c o m ing me s s age s p at ting me on the back for what was - - so it see m s - - a wonder ful c or re ction ! !
My home is so quiet right now .
My p ar ent s are tak ing a n a p and my you ng er brother is study ing .
I am a little b or ed .
A fter I read the b ook , I am going to study for the written ex a m for a dr ive r ' s l ic en se .
To m or r ow I will go to ex a m in ation ha ll for my dr ive r ' s l ic en se .
To day I had a present ation about tra n s p or t ation in my on line English less on .
M o st of our tra n s p or t ve h ic le s us e o il - b as ed f u el , and the world ' s o il re s er ve s are run n ing out .
There f or e we need to change our ve h ic le s to one s that us e no n - o il - b as ed f u el .
L a st S un day , I went to my friend ' s house for a B B Q .
W at ch ing a b a b y gr ow ing up
One of the most beautiful things in the world is watch ing a b a b y gr ow ing up .
I am at home the se days on the ho l i day of N ation al D a y .
He ll o guy s ,
`` K y le and his me n were able to take a great many p h ot o g r a p h s of the mo un tain s be l ow . ``
so c c er is play ed around the world .
I play so c c er with my friend s .
I c a n ' t speak English , but I can make friend s who are from another country .
I think the mind can speak if language can not be us ed .
I enjoy ed play ing so c c er .
D o es te ch no l o g y wide n the ga p between the poor and the ri ch ?
No w in the new mi ll en n i um , s c i ent if ic te ch no l o g y has in c re as ing ly a d v ance d and the dis p ar ity between the we al th y and the need y have great ly en h ance d . Some in d i v id u al s have l in k the ga p to the a d v ance d te ch no l o g ies .
However , from an e m p ir ical view , I re ally hard - p re s s ed to im a g in e how the sp e c t r um of te ch no l o g y has at t ri b ut ed to the we al th ga p since it go es without saying that s c i ent if ic te ch no l o g y can d e c re a se dis p ar ity between the we al th y and need y .
To begin with , the pro l if er ation of the i nformation high way have take n po s s i b il ity to the poor to op er ate a ho st of things , which would have been un im a g in able two de c ad es a g o .
T a ke to ur ing ( O R tra ve ling ) for ex amp le , before the in ter ne t was in v ent ed the only in d i v id u al s qu al if i ed to tra ve l were those with money , while present day we can a p p re c i ate the l and s c a pe any where on the p la ne t or even on mar s just v i a the in ter n ne t .
M or e o ver , it is w il d a c k n ow led g ed that the mo b i le p h on e , one of the most sign if ic ant in ve n tion s in twenty c ent ur y , has tra n s f or m ed in d i v id u al s ' live s into high ly e f f ic i ent and con ve n i ent living , es pe c i ally for the poor .
B y p re s s ing a but t on , we can con ne c t with any on e any where , which in turn en ri ch es people ' s life va ri ous and en able s the hu man ra ce living in different e c on o m ic st at us es .
I ' m listen ing to m us ic again .
M us ic always keep my bra in act ive .
The answer is that I find English pass age s on sit es , I try to understand the mean ing s and re m e m b er the new w or d s .
They in t ro d u c ed me to S k p y e and p at i ent ly t aught me how to us e it .
My f e ar of speak ing dis a p pe ar ed , this made me so ha p p y .
I want to become better .
But I have pro ble m s listen ing to it .
It is very difficult for me .
S t ar ting a N e w B l o g - P ar t 2
And W ow ! I think that it ' s a great b l o g !
I re ally like her writing about how she st ud i ed and what she felt d ur ing the pro ce s s .
T h r ough her writing , I got a new mo t i v ation to start writing my own study b l o g .
My English is not good enough to do something like that .
I need more time to study b as ic things . That ' s what I always said to myself .
but the fact is that I have done it .
The piece was C h op in `` e t ud e op . 1 0 no . 3 ``
A bout 1 0 year s a g o I would p r a c t ic e every day .
So I c a n ' t mo ve my f ing er s s m o o th ly .
E ver y day this week I was out at night .
It ' s so time con s um ing and my time is limit ed .
I ' m not so bad now , but not f l u ent enough .
The pro ble m is the co st and the effect ive ness .
I can read easy English , like this ar t ic le f a st , but more difficult ar t ic le s , like new s p a p er s , make me di z z y and dis c o ur age d .
I gue s s I need much more v o c a b ul ar y and a large am o un t of read ing .
I have been study ing all after no on
and then I went to the l i b r ar y to return b ook s
because I run out strange things
I had to walk around . . . . what l u c k !
I re m e m b er that I ha v ne n ' t been con t at ing my bo y f ri en d for a long long time .
I wonder if he has n ' t for g ot ten me .
I always believe that one day we ' ll be to g e ther
I mi s s him . . . . .
I feel so alone . . .
I have had a pai n in my c al f for a long time .
It ' s for t un ate that now the ra in y sea s on has come .
Even if I did n ' t have this pai n , I could not run outside because of the ra in .
I have take n charge of all ar r an g e ment s of on - the - job train ing .
I felt the difficult ies as a mo d er at or because the meeting got compli c at ed !
R e la x ing in my house
To day , I enjoy ed my time in my house unti l my work started at 5 p m .
I l o ve my house because it get s a l ot of s un s h in e , so I can be re la x with a c up of co f f e e there very well .
E ver y day , my work start s e ar ly in the morning such as , at 6 : 3 0 a m , so I went out before da w n .
A fter eat ing l un ch ,
I went to the m us ical in st r u ment s sh op to re p a ir my u ku le le .
When I was in H on o l ul u more than 2 0 year s a g o , I happen ed to find this one .
I was n ' t sure whether to bu y it or not ,
because this u ku le le was so ex p en s ive .
But , however I f in ally made up my mind to bu y it .
It can express a va ri e ty of sound from L o ve B al la d t un es to per c us s ive t un es .
I l o ve play ing it and I was sat is f i ed with this to ne .
As my u ku le le is easily out of t un e re c ent ly , I asked a c r a f t man to change the pe g s .
A t the moment , my favor ite u ku le le is being re p a ir ed .
I am im p at i ent for it s return .
Yes ter day it ha il ed in S ha ng ha i .
O b v i ous ly the we a ther should be s um m er - like .
A fter ha il ing it was very co o l outside .
But not long after the s k y became dark . . .
I like d the night .
A t that time it was 4 p m .
L a st time it was ra in ing .
It ra in ed so much !
And at 1 8 o ' clock I had J a p an e se class .
And there was a tra f f ic j a m when I was going to school on the ro ad .
L u c k i ly I only got a little we t .
It was ra in ing so he a v i ly when I was on the bu s so I was fine .
And as I get old er , there is an in c re a se ri s k .
My hu s b and suggest ed to me to mo ve .
It is interest ing .
J a p an e se is not understood by a l ot of people in the world .
But mathematics is understood by every on e in the world .
We first me t in U n ive r s ity when I was a fresh man .
We easily became close to each other because we had many things in co m m on .
S in ce we first me t , we have sp ent a l ot of time to g e ther because we study at the same un ive r s ity and we always take the same course s .
He always smile s and it make s me smile too .
But , one day , I heard that he s ud d en ly b ro ke up with his girl f ri en d .
I could n ' t believe it at first because they have had a very good re l ation s h i p since I first me t them .
On the day I heard this new s , I sp ent all night with him to co m f or t him .
My favor ite sub j e c t are J a p an e se , es pe c i ally mo d er n J a p an e se writing for the follow ing reason s :
N e x t , I like read ing and writing ha i ku po e m s .
T h ough a ha i ku po e m is very short , it has pro f ound mean ing s .
That ' s why study ing J a p an e se writing make s it more interest ing for me .
I have a con st ant head a ch e the se days , es pe c i ally when I he ar loud voice s .
I s it because I have a co l d or something wrong with my body ?
On my way home
To day I ' m going to see a b a se b a ll game at J ing u st ad i um with my s is ter .
As I w ro te on a previous day , we are C h un i ch i D r a g on s f an s .
This is second time s that we ' ve go ne there to g e ther .
I l o ve to p l an b ir th day part ies for my ch il d re n !
Even if there is a l ot of s n ow outside !
S p r ing time ; )
A a a h h h I c a n ' t believe it , but S p r ing is coming here : D O f c it ' s still s n ow y , w in d y and - 3 de g re es . . but the b ir d s are s ing ing , the s un is sh in ing and every on e ' s s m il ing .
I like S p r ing . . .
It ' s a time for l o ve & ro m ance , do n ' t you think so ? ^ ^
E ar l i er , S p r ing came here just after M ar ch ( even on my sp r ing va c ation I went s k i ing and it was natural s n ow there ! ) And now just on 1 st of M ar ch the we a ther has change d : after such co l d and dark days came S p r ing days : D
But they say this we a ther w o n ' t last long , and already on 1 0 th of M ar ch again it will be co l d and not p le as ant outside = (
A a a h h , on 8 th of M ar ch is our in ter n ation al f e m al e ' s day .
I ho pe the we a ther will be good !
I have been le ar n ing v o c a b ul ar y with this sit e ' s m ar t .
So I will write something here .
B e c a us e she w on a co st um e con t est and got a new T V , she did not need her old one .
However the old one is not so old , and we did not have a T V .
They want ed to go to M e ta ll ic a ' s live conc er t / show though did n ' t have ti c ke t s . So they attempt ed to b re a k into the ha ll .
I could n ' t help laugh ing when I saw this , because it was ri d ic ul ous .
The other day , I tri ed to bu y a live r ock b and ti c ke t but I could n ' t , even though I re ally want ed to go .
A f e w days la ter , I found the ti c ke t on an in ter ne t a u ction .
It s p ri ce ro se by qu ad r up le .
I was at a los s whether to bu y it or not , and then I de c id ed not to bu y it .
I think that my de c is ion was right in the end , because I did n ' t do it only to s a ve money but also to op po se an over ch ar g e .
E ver since I came back from C an ad a , I have had j e t la g .
I mean , I did n ' t me e t any on e to day ( not even my room ma te ! ) so I ten d to be la z y .
If I want to stay a w a ke , I can stay a w a ke .
It mean s , that s tak ing a long time to re c o ver is a natural condition .
F in ally , I ' ve been l o o s ing my natural r h y th m as usual .
I have to re c o ver because I have to go to work on M on day !
L a st week , I me t a strange man .
I ra n along the ro ad . When I ar ri v ed home I did n ' t see that man .
I have had sleep less days d ur ing this s um m er .
This was my ex c us e for to day .
I started read ing a new s p a p er in English .
I sub s c ri b ed As a h i We e k ly for 3 month s as a tri al .
It has many kind s of is s u es and or g an i z ed by the le ve l of difficult y .
I have not had enough v o c a b ul ar y to read it though without a di ction ar y yet , but I will try to keep read ing for 3 month s .
I of ten feel ho pe s and f e ar s .
And es pe c i ally , I am un e as y about the future .
No w a day s , there is difficult y in find ing a job .
So , I do n ' t know my future . . .
I would like to work in a rather big comp an y ! ! !
I b or r ow ed a b ook from the l i b r ar y at my un ive r s ity ti t led `` Why the J a p an e se people c a n ' t speak English ? `` .
The a u th or show ed some reason s why the J a p an e se are poor at speak ing English .
I would like to show one of the se reason s .
The first one is because they did n ' t need to speak English in the past .
The reason why P h il i p p in o s and In d i an s can speak English is because they us ed to be a co l on y of A m er ic a and they had to us e English to live a s m o o th life .
M or e o ver , he state s that the J a p an e se people had no clear go al to le ar n it .
I ho pe we have a de f in ite go al and keep the mo t i v ation to study it .
A l P a c in o impress ed me with his as t on ish ing act ing in the mo v i e `` In s o m n i a `` .
A fter finish ing this mo v i e , I de e p ly felt p ar ad o x ical and could not draw a line between just ic e and e v il .
On A l ' s ar ri v ing at this town , he began to come down with in s o m n i a .
No t only does he have to co pe with in t ri c ate case but also face his un te ll able se c re t .
R o b in W i ll i a m s un e x pe c ted ly s w it ch ed from a come d i an to a co l d - b l o o d k i ll er in this mo v i e .
So we have to tea ch them next S un day so they can get high s c or es .
I do n ' t like to work on a ho l i day , even if I get ex t r a money .
F ir st of your question s , I think the most p op ul ar sea s on for w ed d ing is sp r ing .
I think it is a re ally good idea for people who are look ing for a part n er .
My brother came with the f l u two days a g o because he did n ' t want to give it to his p re g n ant w if e and 2 - year - old d aught er .
So , my mo m took care of him for two days and she got the f l u this morning . . .
I sh op p ed at a dr u g st or e and a gr o ce ry st or e , and made ud on noodle s .
O h , but I did n ' t make ud on from s c r at ch .
I just bo il ed read y - to - go U d on noodle s , and made so up and a d d ed some T empura , f ri ed ve g e t able s , bo il ed sp in a ch , b a k ed J a p an e se le e k s , and half a c ook ed e g g .
I ho pe they like d / enjoy ed their U d on l un ch .
I thought that start ing out with only `` so c i al something `` could get in ve st or s unti l I dis c us s ed with the V C about the c ur r ent in ve st ing sit u ation in J a p an .
P ro b ably because an in ve st or understand s that J a p an e se - b as ed S N S c a n ' t be s c al ed all over the world ?
In any case , it ' s good new s for my business , because my in it i al set up is n ' t an S N S .
I have nothing to do this week en d !
It is a p ity .
He l p me .
S e e you ! !
I ho pe my English writing s k i ll s are im p ro v ed by writing j o ur n al s on L an g - 8 almost every day .
I have st ud i ed this sub j e c t for three year s .
I re ally respect two people : And re w k r ame r and C as s id y B ish er .
A re they p op ul ar in the U . S . ?
I s there any on e more p op ul ar than them ?
B y the way , the world is a big place .
The t al ent is limit less .
To day , I dr o ve my w if e and her mother to a conc er t by a l o c al ch or us gr o up .
I like ma k ing a l ot of no is e with m us ical in st r u ment s , but I am not good at s ing ing and can not understand people who start s ing ing regard less of where they are . e
However , my w if e and d aught er s be l on g to ch or us c l u b s , and I am c ur r ent ly o b l i g ed to sp en d my free time with them .
L ad y G a g a is one of my favor ite ar t is t s .
I was surprise d when I saw a picture of her ar ri v ing in Tokyo .
It is we ir d : ) M a y b e she asked the c a b in at ten d ant s to write a J a p an e se me s s age on her ex p en s ive b a g on the p la ne l o l She also said when her f an s see her in J a p an , please write a me s s age on her b a g .
To day , I am going to go to a p h ot o sh op to get a picture of my family take n .
I may dress in a s u it .
My do g is includ ed in my family .
My do g will also be in the p h ot o .
I w ro te in English since 4 year s a g o , so may have many
I ' m ma j or y in me d ic in e , and I ' ll get do c t or ' s l ic en se on F e b r u ar y / 2 0 1 2 .
It ' s very us e ful for le ar n ing English .
M ed ical E x a m in ation .
I had a bad re s ul t last year so now I ' m tak ing care of my body .
I ' m ho p ing to get a good re s ul t this year .
A ch ance to le ar n English ! !
But after gradua tion , I almost never saw it .
so I for g ot l ot s of w or d s and id i o m s .
R e c ent ly I have started teaching English to my d aught er .
She go es to an English less on by a n at ive speak er one day a week .
And at home , I let her le ar n English too .
F or ex amp le , read ing her picture b ook s , watch ing D V D s and play ing C D s d ur ing her play time .
Some time s she say s an English w or d .
However I can understand spoke n English a little b it , but I can not speak it .
B e c a us e I st ud i ed English only for the entrance ex a m in ation for un ive r s ity .
I think now is the time for start ing to le ar n English again !
When I was gr ow ing up , I a d or ed small c re a ture s such as in se c t s and fish .
I was particular ly in f at u at ed with be e t le s .
A fter we c aught them , we would of ten put them in case s to keep in our house .
I like d to see them s u c k s a p s we f ed them , and o c c as ion ally fight head to head over s a p s or f e m al es in the p la st ic case at night , as they are usual ly no c t ur n al .
It was as if they had show n me a mi n i a ture world that th ri ll ed me in the small p la st ic case .
F ish ing was also my favor ite act i v ity when I was in e le ment ar y school .
No w I ' ve gr ow n out of that kind of thing .
I ' m keep ing my house h o l d account s .
However , I c a n ' t s a ve money .
E d u c ation , f o o d and incident al co st s . . . .
I have no idea why I c a n ' t s a ve money .
I do n ' t want to was te any more money .
It ' s my a im for the coming year .
I am in my first year of gradua te school now .
A ll become s in e v it able .
On the other hand , I ' ve heard that a l ot of students ex c ept J a p an look for the ent er p ri se after their commen ce ment ce re m on y , and some people act by the volunteer ing for one year , or other s tra ve l around the world .
I s this sen t ence for business letter is O K ?
We receiv ed your letter regard ing the p ot at o ch i p s you p ur ch as ed which has a mi l d e w in the k i b ble and then you receiv ed poor c ust ome r s er v ic e from us .
F or ex amp le , in J a p an , where I c ur r ent ly live , there are four dis t in c t sea s on s .
On the other hand , I am sure I would get b or ed with the mo no t on y of having the same we a ther all year round .
I think it is better to have a c ity life than to have a life in the country s id e .
A l th ough some people insist that r ur al life is s a f er , heart w ar m ing , and friend ly with nature , there are more de m er it s comp ar ed with a c ity life .
That is why the people who want to live in a c ity has been in c re as ing , and that of r ur al life has de c re as ed ra p id ly .
I have both ex pe ri ence s of living in the c ity and the country s id e .
E ver y time I am re m in d ed of the days of living in the country s id e , I can not help but feel i ll .
S e c on d , the mo d er n ar t ex h i b i tion or conc er t would never be he l d in a small town where I live d so that there were little op p or t un it ies for a country girl to enjoy ar t .
C on t r ar y to my s is ter , who was living in a c ity , I had to take a long bu s tri p to watch the show s and conc er t s I l o v ed .
T h us I had to sp en d much money and time to p ur s u e my ar t is t ic ho b b y .
That may be the be st reason I mo v ed to the c ity after w ar d .
F in ally , d u e to the close d en v ir on ment , there were f e w people who mo v ed into or ( mo v ed ) out of my little v i ll age .
F or that reason , all the me m b er s of my e le ment ar y school , j un i or high school and high school were comp le te ly the same .
There f or e no hu man in ter a ction ex is ted there .
To comp ar ed with such a ter ri ble life in the country s id e .
I am enjoy ing my un ive r s ity life in the c ity very much .
W al k ing and ri d ing a b ic y c le take s me any where I want , and the ex h i b i tion s and conc er t s are he l d almost every week en d .
It is p ar ad is e for such an ar t is t ic person like me .
M or e o ver I made many new friend s who have different thought s and ro ot s as we can in s p i re each other .
F or those reason s , I de f in ite ly prefer a c ity life to a r ur al life .
S ur e ly this must be one of the most st up id est things I did in the past 3 year s .
I like to read before going to sleep , so there was a p i le of b ook s at the head of the be d right be s id e my p i ll ow .
I then rolled the she e t up and the other she e t s to g e ther with the p i ll ow case s r and took them down st a ir s to put into the was h ing machi ne .
I open ed the l id , took one she e t out at a time and f o l d ed it r ough ly and put it into the b as ke t .
There was something there that should never have go ne in with the la un d ry machi ne .
I had was h ed my ce ll p h on e in it !
As you may know , the last thing you would want to do when you dr op your ce ll p h on e in the water is to try to and turn it on .
B e c a us e there ' s water in the c ir c u it , that will stop short on you the moment it s turn ed on .
In s te ad , you should take out the b at ter y and S I M c ar d im m ed i ate ly , un c a p all the c a p s for the p or t s , and w r a p it with a to w el and sha ke it well to re m o ve any ex ce s s water .
A fter that you can f in ally b r ing it to the re ta il sh op where you b ough t it .
I knew it , but my know led g e did n ' t come in hand y .
A fter all , my poor ce ll p h on e had been so a k ed in so a p y water for more than 3 0 minute s .
But wait , I thought , `` S e e ing that it has already under g on e the sp in dr y c y c le , it may dr y quick ly and I could at least s al v age the da ta on it ! ``
Well , even I ' m not sure if that ' s tru e .
No w that I ' ve wait ed for three days for it comp le te ly dr y , I ' ll b r ing it to a near b y A U sh op .
I ' ve us ed it for two and half year s now and particular ly like d the di g it al came r a - like appear ance and f e a ture s .
I ' m a house w if e now so I do n ' t have a job but I do have house h o l d ch or es .
Some time s they are a both er to do but g en er ally I like them .
This morning , an in s ur ance lady visit ed my house and off er ed me the same job she does .
I have a b a b y bo y and a 3 - year - old girl and I do n ' t want to have a job yet , so I de c line d .
That was very an no y ing .
B e c a us e I think house h o l d ch or es are a hard job .
This p h on e has a sp e c if ic character : it ' s came r a is made by S O N Y with high qu al ity .
I will go to No v a S c ot i a , C an ad a this week , so if I have some ch ance s , I will us e it .
E s pe c i ally , since I can eat l o b s ter s !
I ' m la y ing in my be d and ty p ing this on my ce ll p h on e .
R i g h t now it feel s more like the middle of O c t o b er rather than the end of A u g ust .
I even had to put on a ha t ( which I w is e ly keep in my j a c ke t ' s in n er pocket just in case ) this even ing when I was coming back home from my girl f ri en d s place l ate at night .
My e ar s would ' ve f ro z e if I did n ' t have my ha t .
It is first time for `` T an g o no S e k ku `` for him .
We put up c ar p str e ame r s or display im it ation J a p an e se ar m o ur and sword s . We call it `` K o d o m o no hi `` .
The first time , it was an old even t d ur ing the N ar a per i o d . To day is the turn of the sea s on , We have distribute d me d ical her b s to a v o id sick ness and mi s f or t un e .
And the G en er al ' s ch il d is con g r at ul at ed d ur ing the To ku g a w a sh o g un ate . The me d ical her b is p ic k ed to dis pe l e v il spirit s d ur ing the T an g o even t , it is thought . It is re la ted to the ce le b r ation of the bo y ' s b ir th .
I will eat a ri ce c a ke w r a p p ed in o a k leave s and a ri ce d um p ling w r a p p ed in bamboo leave s .
I think he would w an n a eat that .
W h i ch sen t ence is c or re c t and why ?
I write a letter by my p en c il . In c or e c c t .
as u may know : )
I j o in ed this sit e to day
and im writing my second di ar y ent ry & n b s p ; already ! !
I thought that this sit e would help p p l who w an n a im p ro ve their language s k i ll z
e ng l ish di ar ies are not take n serious ly ! !
no one take s care of us ha ha ha
I mean , us as in gr ow n me n , not girl s .
only gr ow n me n , not girl s
E N G L I S H guy s only care about girl s l o l
da m n . .
may b e , im not to b l ame for those kind s of guy s x D
just w an n a make f un of & n b s p ; this because I am tired of st ud ing this la g u age
y e a I know I have & n b s p ; this l on e ly di ar y which also can help my study
it s o k if no body see s and f i x es my di ar y
i ll keep work ing on it
The first thing im p or t ant in education is know led g e .
E d u c ation give s us the know led g e of the world around us .
I I t help s us c re ate a point of view for everything in our life .
E d u c ation is not about less on s and te x t b ook s .
It is about the less on s of life .
L ate ly , I have comp le te ly los t interest in study ing English .
I c a n ' t conc ent r ate and I am im p at i ent with myself ,
but I do n ' t want give up on study ing English .
So , I thought of the reason why I have los t interest in study ing English .
One of the cause s is becom ing tired of ro ut in e work .
I need a new ro ut in e .
M a y b e It will be good p r a c t ic e for me ,
but , I ' m not sure that I can keep on to p of it or not .
What do you do when are you tired of ro ut in e work and what is your favor ite way to study English ?
If it were possible , ( does n ' t make any sen se . . . )
A g a in E ul er , this guy never stop p ed .
This is a s c re w ed up ma t ri x .
Besides that , I think he still speak s very hu m b ly .
He always speak s like , `` Let me b la h b la h b la h , `` or `` P le a se all ow me to b la h b la h b la h . `` I le ar n many things about both English and mathematics from him .
He was e i g h ty year s old and he mar ri ed her when they were 3 0 and 3 2 .
He was a st ud ent at the time but de s p ite that , she de c id ed to get mar ri ed to him because she in st in c t ive ly `` knew `` that he was the right man .
I just thought that would be my per f e c t de a th .
I have just re m e m b er ed that .
A fter all , I am a very l u c k y man now .
I ' m sit ting under the k ot at s u , and I at e an or an g e .
It ' s a very ha p p y time for me , es pe c i ally in w in ter !
There is a l ot of s n ow in w in ter .
I need friend s around me to give me w ar m care and dr ive f e ar away . . .
I need l o ve that can mo t i v ate end less str e ng th de e p inside my heart . . .
after a 5 . 1 2 e ar th qu a ke she was sen t to this school by her p ar ent s - - my s is ter and brother - in - law , because they do n ' t have enough time to take care of her .
The eat th qu a ke made them c r a z y : the te m p or ar y p la st ic house is ve y hot in s um m er and very f ri g id in w in ter , and they are so bu s y with their work that no one can watch the kid .
A t first they want to find a b a b y s it ter to take care of the kid , however , no one want s to take that job because they are bu s y with their own business .
F in ally they have to sen d her to a boarding school which is almost 2 0 0 k il ome ter s k il ome t re away from their town , and this is the near est school to their town .
Yes ter day I called my n i e ce , and she told me she will sen d me a new year c ar d .
I a k s ed her what she most want ed in the new year .
she is only 7 y e ar s old and she has to be ar many things which are be y on d her age .
I know her wish will not come tru e in the next year , because they still have no new house .
I ho pe there will no such wish any m or e and every ch il d can stay to g e ther with his / her da d and m um every day .
As the B e i j ing O ly m p ic s started a f e w days a g o , I think many people are interest ed in this to p ic !
I watch ed the ra ce , it was very ex c it ing . I want him to get another me d al in the 2 0 0 me ter s b re a st st ro ke !
R y o k o T an i could n ' t get a go l d me d al , but she got b ro n z e me d al .
`` D ad d y , you have to co un t to ten before you get out of the bath t u b `` she said .
I went to the N as & D a m i an M ar le y J a p an To ur yesterday .
They perform ed for about 2 hour s .
It was such a c r a z y night ! ! !
A t the end of the conc er t , D a m i an s an g , `` C o ul d you be l o v ed . ``
The who le c r ow d was very ex cited ! !
Yes ter day I went to a b ook st or e with my A m er ic an friend and b ough t three paper b a c k s : `` The ch ro n ic le s of N ar n i a `` and two other b ook s for 2 0 per c ent off .
A fter I came home , I or d er ed what I did n ' t have yet of `` The ch ro n ic le s of N ar n i a `` and their who le s er ies of a ud i o b ook s on C D from A m a z on .
A l th ough it is a J a p an e se sit e , I think it will help me ma in tain mo t i v ation to read paper b a c k s in English .
There f or e , I up d at ed m y b l o g .
A fter I read the paper b a c k s , I can put them on my b ook s he l f on line .
When I look at the number of b ook s on my b ook s he l f , I will be ha p p y because I can make sure of the number of b ook s he l ve s I have .
I will write re v i e w s in English after I read paper b a c k s in English .
I ' m sure that writing re v i e w s in English is de f in ite ly good for me to p r a c t ic e to express my feel ing s and thought s in English .
A l th ough I put se ve n paper b a c k s on my b ook s he l f on line , I want to in c re a se the number of b ook s there .
You can ch o se de ta il s a ccord ing to your sit u ation : b ook s you already finish ed read ing , b ook s you will read from now on and b ook s you are read ing right now .
In my case I have n ' t settled up my b ook s he l f .

F in ally I can say that I ' ve found them !
T h an k you for down l o ad ing the se ma g ic w or d s .
I watch ed sea s on 1 and sea s on 2 .
I had watch ed it last year on D V D , but by ch ance it was a ir ed on te le v is ion .
It was very ex c it ing , so I watch ed it 1 5 e p is o d es in one sit ting .
I like almost all of his m us ic . There is a piece of m us ic / so ng by him called `` s m o o th c ri m in al `` .
It is a f a m ous so ng with / and has a j a un ty r h y th m .
I l o ve it , but I wonder that n at ive s who speak English think of the so ng because I think the ly ri c s are not so en ri ch ed / pro f ound .
I want to pass the second gra d e of a i k id o in A p ri l .
No , it sound s difficult .
So I W I L L get it this year because

The Y e ar E n d P ar ty .
We at e S p an ish dis he s and they were so de l ic i ous ! !
And I sp ent about 4 0 0 0 yen for the c a b ! !
I ' ll be care ful not to dr in k too much next time .
C o ll e g e dr in k ing with j un i or students .
I am a second year m aster ' s de g re e st ud ent .
To day we he l d the co ll e g e dr in k ing s es s ion .
T h ir d year students have to de c id e what / which la b to j o in .
But they do n ' t know much about each la b .
It is a ch ance of he ar ing about la b s which may do m in ate their live s after . gra d ut ation
A st ud ent think s much of free time .
A st ud ent think s much of what he / she can study .
A st ud ent take s co un t of p rofessor ' s person al ity .
It brought back me m or ies of the past from when I was in that sit u ation .
He ll o !
I want to speak English !
L it er ally has no mo t i v ation to do anything , so I w an n a have some m us ic and mo v ies to in s p i re me and make me c al m !
D o you have any re c o m m en d ation s ?
The J a p an e se tax return s te p s are very simple .
In J a p an , most of the s al ar i ed people do not need to do their tax re p or t s by themselves because the comp an ies do them on be h al f of the e m p l o y e es .
The comp an ies f i ll in their e m p l o y e es ' tax do c u ment s , the e m p l o y e es c he c k and sign , write their name , and st amp their sign e t s on their tax do c u ment s to con f ir m that th e do c u ment s are c or re c t .
The e m p l o y e es do not need to do m a th or hi re account ant s to get their tax return .
However , t people who are s el f - e m p l o y ed , l and l or d s / l and la d ies , or have certain ty pe s of ex p en se s over $ 1 0 0 0 , have to re p or t for their f in al in c ome tax return .
But it was still a s un n y day to day .
It has been ra in ing in our c ity for s ever al days .
I felt so bad . E ver y th ing is bad .
B e c a us e the se are my last days of va c ation , I will go back to work in a f e w days .
If it were n ' t ra in ing , I could go sh op p ing with my friend s , I could go to the p ar k for a f un day , or I could go to the mo v ies with my friend s .
B e c a us e it ' s ra in ing , I can only stay at home . . .
I cha ll e ng ed it many time s , but f a il ed so far .
I started L an g - 8 b l o g s er v ic e on S e p . 3 r d .
I want to keep this di ar y even if it ' s only for short st or ies .
The B us k er
It took us one and a half month s to co ll e c t i nformation about bu s k er s and to look for s u it able in ter v i e w e e for an in de p th in ter v i e w .
Then , we found M U s , a F re n ch man , who has live d in T a i w an for three year s .
He is a bu s k er , who does a c ro b at ic s very well , usual ly perform ing in the square of X in y i V ies h ow .
The do c u ment ar y f il m we want to find was the st or ies behind s bu s k er s , like their past im es , another work ty pe or something be s id e street p re f or m s .
It ' s ex c it ing to di g an un k n ow n story .
And it is also a ch ance for you to know how much you are l o v ed by the people around you .
In this point of view , b ir th day s are a day to feel w ar m and l o v ed for both you and your family and friend s .
This is my first time writing on this sit e !
I think this sit e is re ally us e ful for people who study for e in language s .
You know , D a ve M at th e w s , he is the le ad v o c al is t and g u it ar is t of D a ve M at th e w s b and .
Yes ter day , I heard from a friend that he appeared on an e p is o d e of H ous e M .
in 2 0 0 7 .
I watch ed this e p is o d e .
However , when I first watch ed this e p is o d e , I do n ' t know it was him .
He play s an a ut is t ic s a v ant p i an is t in this e p is o d e .
H is act ing is a w es ome ! !
If you like D a ve M at th e w s , you should watch this e p is o d e of , H ous e M .
I like to put eggs in a s and w i ch , and I us e this too l when I make s and w i ch .
I call it `` E g g - G u i ll ot in e `` but he call s it `` E g g - S l ic er `` , and also he insist ed that the name is s c ar y and I am the only person who call s it `` E g g - G u i ll ot in e `` .
This week en d , I ' m going to run a mar a th on ra ce which is first time for me to run 4 2 . 1 9 5 k m .
Even though I have run a half mar a th on five time s , I am an x i ous about the full mar a th on .
My t ar g e t is to finish with in four - hour s which is called S U B F O U R R U N N ER .
No w , I ' m a tea m le ad er of e k id en which is a re la y ra ce run by four people , with each person run n ing run n ing five k il ome ter s .
I want to le ad to tea m the tri um p h , and so I want to have s up er i or re c or d .
I want to make friend s from all kind s of co un t ri es
I come from C h in a and I want to make friend s from all kind s of co un t ri es so that we can le ar n language s from each other .
If you also have the same interest , please a d d my m s n : s and y _ j u ly @ live . co m

There ' re some a d v ant age s and dis ad v ant age s in c ar ry ing one .
In my opinion , I do n ' t think it ' s a good idea because of some of the reason s de s c ri b ed in the follow ing paragraph s .
B e f or e think ing about it , I ' d like to me n tion a condition of id ent if ic ation s c ar d in J a p an .
A l th ough we have no comp ul s or y id ent if ic ation c ar d , there are two ma j or id ent if ic ation c ar d s .
M o st of the people in J a p an have a id ent if ic ation number on the re s id ent re g is t ry ne t w or k .
M o st of them are people who do n ' t have a dr ive r ' s l ic en se c ar d .
In follow ing paragraph s , I ' ll dis c us s ( or consider ) this to p ic in regard s to the two id ent if ic ation c ar d s .
F ir st of all , an id ent if ic ation c ar d could be st o le n .
M an y people are c ar ry ing an id ent if ic ation c ar d in their wall e t .
A l s o , it could be st o le n by a p ic k p ock e t .
Even if the id ent if ic ation c ar d it s el f is n ' t st o le n , piece s of person al i nformation on the c ar d could be st o le n such as a d ate of b ir th or an id ent if ic ation number .
To a v o id this , some people say `` you should be care ful ! `` But , it ' s no us e in the case of s k im m ing .
The re s ul t of this is that your id ent if ic ation c ar d might be co un ter f e it ed and your de ta il s could be us ed in c ri m es .
If it was a dr ive r ' s l ic en se c ar d , you would n ' t be able to dr ive unti l your l ic en se c ar d is re is s u ed .
So , the style of those id ent if ic ation c ar d s is out d at ed .
With the se for m s of id ent if ic ation , we do n ' t need a c ar d any m or e so you can go any where without the c ar d and a u th ent ic ate your id ent ity by your s el f if you need to .
A l th ough you c a n ' t take much a d v ant age of the c ar d , it has the p ot ent i al to end an g er your life .
H o pe ful ly , many people will a c k n ow led g e the a d v ant age s of an a d v ance d te ch no l o g y like b i ome t ri c s and we will be able to us e their me ri t s in the near future - - - a s a f er and s m ar ter life .
He is going to study a b ro ad in Tokyo from this a ut um n to next sp r ing .
He and I some time s try to talk v i a S k y pe .
We are n ' t s k i ll ful enough to us e for e i g n language s with each other .
Some time s we had to stop our con ver s ation and I could only say `` u h a h `` .
However , I ' m feel ing his de ter m in ation to le ar n J a p an e se .
T h ough he is almost as you ng as my so n ,
I re ally respect him and his p ar ent s who are will ing to sen d their l o ve ly kid to
an un k n ow n , my s ter i ous country where people l o ve to eat e el s .
I am look ing for w ar d to his ar ri v al in J a p an and to talk ing direct ly
even if I say `` u h a h `` .
O f course we must go to J a p an e se re st a ur ant s to eat e el s .
P le a se take care the long tri p , and we l c ome again .
We b ro ke water m el on s after l un ch to day .
So it was so hot to stay outside at around 1 p m , and I was s w e at ing a l ot .
However , more than that , the water m el on was re ally sweet and it ' s good to see ch il d re n ' s big smile ! !
Some of them could n ' t eat water m el on before , or never tri ed it before , but now they know that water m el on ta st es good ! ! !
I me t an ent re p re ne ur who run s the same ty pe of in d ust ry as me .
We saw e y e to e y e and agree d that mo b i le a p p s like i P h on e a p p l ic ation s will be im p or t ant for us .
I think that they will be more ri ch and us e 3 D comp ut er gra p h ic s .
One of my co - work er is going to transfer to another bra n ch ,
so we th re w him a farewell part y to night .
so I was very dis a p po in ted to he ar the an no un ce ment at first .
A t the part y , I was too s ad to part from him , and we end ed up c ry ing to g e ther .
I went to the night mar ke t , which is open every S at ur day in the c ity I c ur r ent ly live in .
The night in T a i w an is just as bu st ling as in the day time .
The night mar ke t in my home t ow n end s at about 1 1 p m .
Some f a m ous night mar ke t s are open unti l mi d night or la ter .
The night mar ke t con s is t s of many ve n d or s .
It ' s ( It is ) always c r ow d ed in the mar ke t .
There is a v id e o on You T u b e about N i g h t M ar ke t s in T a i w an .
B y the way , I have never see n any f a c il m aster s in the night mar ke t s I have visit ed .
M o st of our gr o up had ga ther ed at the we st of ga te of our school in the morning .
We w o er e the same c l o th es , which were de s i g n ed by us , so it was beautiful .
B y bu s , we went to an interest ing place where there where l ot of hi ll s and tree s .
V ar i ous act i v it ies can be done , such as hi ll - c l im b ing or fish ing and s w im m ing and so on .
A l th ough , the hi ll is n ' t high , we felt very tired as we ar ri v ed at the hi ll t op .
We cha t ted to g e ther about what we like and our ho b b ies and help ed with other .
A ll of us were ha p p y when saw beautiful scene ry .
There I not only visit ed a temple where a B ud d ha who lie s on the hi ll t op is , but also took p h ot o s with my friend s .
We had a p ic n ic at a near b y ri ver in after no on .
Some people b ough t f o o d and some people p re p ar ed f i re and other s play ed game s .
One of my friend s and I c ook ed , and it was very de l ic i ous for us to eat .
We felt a smile sp re ad to all of the world , so it was a very ha p p y day !
When I a p p l i ed for it , I was sub s c ri b ed to a s er v ic e that de l ive r s a new s p a p er for a month for free .
Then , The D a i ly Y o m i ur i is de l ive r ed every day from J un e 1 st .
However , I have n ' t read them because I did n ' t want to read them .
This even ing , I read one a little .
I have some good friend s , however , we have different ex pe ri ence s and care er s .
in life .
But we have the same ho b b y , s ing ing so ng s .
B e c a us e some people would be an no y ed ( ? ) we o c c as ion ally s an g so ng s at a place called Ka la O k .
We us ed to a v o id the r us h hour .
The reason was not only the co st , but also at that time we could get better s er v ic e .
We s an g and dance d with a b and on and not much de c or um .
We tea s ed each other , made j o ke s and en c o ur age d one another
A t that time , we did not ma in tain our so c i al ro le s any m or e , like mother , w if e , and care er woman .
We s an g so ng s again and again , all past things had come in to our mind .
Some time , re g re t s w o n ' t be con s o led by w or d s .
But can be re la x ed by m us ic
I j o in in my class m ate s to wish all teachers in the world a ha p p y T e a ch er ' s D a y .
The teacher ga ve me some a d v ic e to le ar n to speak English when I was a middle school st ud ent .
She t aught me to pro no un ce each w or d and some da i ly con ver s ation .
A l th ough , I was n ' t good at English , my teacher still spoke e a ch w or d and sen t ence to me and was p at i ent as she told me to pro no un ce right .
I will not for g e t everything she t aught me in my life .
In the future , I will be pro ud of my teacher .
I respect T h o m as E d is on who is a great in v ent or in the U . S .
He was b or n in the middle of the 1 9 th c ent ur y .
I ma j or ed in M e ch an ical E ng in e er ing and I st ud i ed about the mo tion of hu man o id ro b ot .
When I felt some difficult ies in my study , E d is on ' s f a m ous w or d s always c he er ed me up .
The qu o te : `` G en i us is one per c ent in s p ir ation and 99 per c ent per s p ir ation . ``
He in v ent ed im p or t ant things such as the p h on o g r a p h .
He also had a great ability to im p ro ve other s ' in ve n tion s and make the in ve n tion us ed wide ly like e le c t ri c the light bu l b .
In my un ive r s ity , there are very f e w people who have a the t al ent s of in ve n tion and man age ment .
I will hold my w ed d ing ce re m on y in a week .
I think J a p an e se w ed d ing ce re m on ies are co st ly .
Why do J a p an e se people sp en d so much money on a w ed d ing ce re m on y ?
O f course , at ten d e es of the ce re m on y will pay mean ing ful money .
I pai d 3 0 0 0 0 yen when I at ten d ed my friend ' s w ed d ing ce re m on y
R e c ent ly , the number of people who do n ' t hold a w ed d ing ce re m on y have in c re as ed d u e to the re ce s s ion .
It co st s less than hold ing a ce re m on y .
But many J a p an e se think that they are re l u c t ant to di v or ce if they hold a w ed d ing ce re m on y that co st s much money ! !
I had too th a ch e last night , so I went to the d ent is t close to my office .
S ur p ri s ing ly , I dis c o ver ed a good look ing guy !
He is a d ent is t too .
I am an no y ed by my too th a ch e , but I ' m look ing for w ar d to going to the d ent is t again .
I ' m an office work er .
I am having the b l u es now .
This is my first te x t on this interest ing sit e .
My English is ter ri ble .
A c t u ally s ever al year s a g o , when my ex - girl f ri en d left me , she took it home .
I f a il ed for the first s ever al time s though even t u ally I became better at it .
I ' m still s ing le . I ho pe some body would eat dis he s that I c ook .
A ll about R and o m N um b er s
A t the moment , p se ud or and o m number s can be made by comp ut er pro g r a m s .
In re al ity though , they can not make tru ly r and o m number s .
If it make s r and o m number s , I think it mean s that it would be a con s c i ous comp ut er .
In J a p an , there are l ot ter ies and machi ne s which p r ed ic t l ot ter y number s .
M a ch in es which almost p r ed ic t the number s are de ve l op ed us ing a simple r and o m number pro g r a m , and the p r ed i ction s are ex p en s ive and sp ur i ous .
The more some on e understand s about r and o m ness , the less in c line d they would be to bu y the se machi ne s .
I some time s want to eat j un k f o o d .
A fter I finish ed school , I went to the s up er mar ke t and I b ough t p ot at o ch i p s and a l ot of ch o c o l ate .
I at e it without eat ing dinner .
I did n ' t have a l ot of money . . . ( I eat good f o o d for my he al th , rather than eat ing j un k f o o d . )
B U T , I c a n ' t stop eat ing !
I dr an k and at e s l ic ed gr il led me at with my friend s yesterday .
I at e and dr an k too much .
I le ar n ed & n b s p ; that w ome n are very compli c at ed .
I have to do many things to make my girl f ri en d ha p p y .
I should p re p ar e my b a g g age for study ing a b ro ad now .
A ll my class m ate s are better than me .
has more p at i ence for me .
B e c a us e my S p an ish is so bad , she did n ' t think she could p r a c t ic e
I think I should sh if t to another class , even if I have to pay an ex t r a fee .
My un ive r s ity does n ' t have the course I need , so I might find a p ri v ate class which is n ' t at the un ive r s ity .
That ' s all .
H i g h s al ar ies make people conc ent r ate on their job .
A ccord ing to the new s p a p er I read re c ent ly , it is e as i er to get a high salary person to pro d u ce high qu al ity good s than a l ow salary person .
F ur ther m or e , in my case , when I work ed with a l ow salary , I could n ' t ga in any interest in my job
S it u ation : E m a il to first tra d ing part n er .
D e ar Sir ,
I am P a w w y a v id e o game pro d u c er in XXXX C or p or ation in J a p an .
We are interest ed in your business .
- do you have any ex pe ri ence of de ve l op ing i P h on e a p p ll ic ation in your comp an y ?
- I s there any on e who can speak J a p an e se in your comp an y ?
But it is n ' t a va c ation .
A n ic e ho c ke y tea m c amp will take place there .
I ' ll have no time , but I want to eat the / some sp e c i al l o c al pro d u c t s .
M a y b e the a ir is fresh , too .
I think I ' ll have some t ough days there , but I want to enjoy it .
I will run the Tokyo M ar a th on to day .
B re a k f a st , dress ing , and so on , I am going to go now .
But I got a question , while I watch ed the dr a m a .
A n act or said `` what the he ll did the da m n d u c k do now ? ``
I got up at 9 a m to day , because I went to sleep very l ate last night .
Then s ud d en ly , the house p h on e ra ng . .
it was my c ous in call ing from Tokyo
S in ce Tokyo is very far from here , I have n ' t see n him for about 1 0 year s .
and I answered y es . . .
Then he said that he was right in front of my house ! !
I was very s ur p ri z ed surprise d to he ar that !
S in ce I had just got ten out of be d I was still in my p a j a m as . . ( ^ ^ ;
I did not even have b re a k f a st yet .
I thought he should have call me before h and .
But he said that he was tra ve ling around the are a and s ud d en ly thought that if we ( my family ? ) were home , he want ed to come visit me e t us .
A n y way he is very c he er ful person , so we had a g o o d time .
O h and , we had S U S H I again . . .
t w ic e in a week !
This is my first time writing a di ar y in E ng l s h .
This is my first time study ing a b ro ad , so I am very n er v ous ! !
I want to be able to us e English f l u ent ly , and I want to study English more and more .
So I ' m begin n ing to write a di ar y on this home p age , and I want you guy s to c he c k mi ne .
J ust now I am stay ing in my a un t ' s house in O a h u is l and , but my un ive r s ity is on the B i g is l and , so I ' ll mo ve there on A u g ust 1 5 th .
I will live in a do r m with a room m ate who I to t ally do n ' t know .
The reason why I want ed to come to H a w a i i to study is that I want to study in H a w a i i : - ) ( good reason )
I have been here , in H a w a i i , more than ten time s since I was two year s old , because my a un t and un c le live there .
S in ce then , I ' ve been to t ally f as c in at ed by H a w a i i and want ed to live and study here .
No w my dr e a m will come tru e .
I will write this di ar y through o ut my time in H a w a i i .
He ll o !
This is my first po st on L an g - 8 .
What should I write here ?
I have no idea !
He l p me im p ro ve my poor English !
T h an k you for your read ing my di ar y .
B y e !
I went to a n a il s al on last week en d .
It was my first time going to a n a il s al on .
I have done my own n a il s , and I re al i z ed that it is hard for me to do every day things .
F or ex amp le , I ' m work ing at an office , so I am require d to do a l ot of ty p ing .
B e c a us e of the n a il s , it is re ally hard to ty pe . . .
B e c a us e there is writing part in the ex a m so I need to ty pe quick ly and c or re c t ly .
I wonder why a l ot of girl s like to do their n a il s even through it is hard to do everything .
To day , I ma il ed to my comp an y ' s s ta f f the me s s age that follow s .
`` C o ul d you tell me how to change the s ch ed ul e of the business tri p that I request ed ? ``
Then the s ta f f said :
`` You must get p ri or a u th or i z ation from your bo s s . ``
I b as ic ally agree with that respon se ,
, but it has no de ta il s .
Then I think , `` I do n ' t know what will happen in the future .
B as ic ally I want to go along with the s ch ed ul e .
But because it is in the future ,
W E D O N O T K N O W I F T H E S C H E D U L E W I L L CHA N G E O R N O T ! ! ! ! ``
I sen t the me s s age a b o ve .
I feel re g re t after sen d ing the me s s age . . . .
The sen t ence was a little too strong .
So the s ta f f receiv ed my S T R O N G feel ing s and they will get a ng ry or s ad .
This is my re g re t to day .
I need to think one more time before sen d ing me s s age s . . . . . . .
R e c ent ly I of ten get de p re s s ed .
But when I le ar n something re la ted to for e i g n language s ,
I can change my mo o d .
When I was a st ud ent ,
Besides I can change my way of think ing when I us e a for e i g n language .
Yes ter day , I found some we b s ite s for le ar n ing language and I was impress ed .
They are as follow s .
We can le ar n language s for free .
I think I need to take some g if t to him this F ri day . D o you think a bo t t le of al c o h o l is a good idea ?
B y the way , I was surprise d when I came here .
It is about n an n ies .
There are many n an n ies in the U S , but they are only a f e w in J a p an .
M o st A m er ic an p ar ent s have to work ; both hu s b and s and w ive s . .
A l m o st all J a p an e se w ive s stay at home .
I think J a p an e se have difficult y accept ing people coming into their house s ex c ept them es el ve s and their family .

On my way home I could n ' t f a ll as le e p because my f o ot was get ting hot .
There was a he at ing v ent be s id e my f o ot .

I called my mother as soon as I re al i z ed that she was n ' t there .
It turn s out that my mother had go ne to c he c k on my gr and m o ther ' s he al th .

However , we have had no ra in since then .
Some ar e glad to have less ra in , but other s are not .
I am afraid that water short age may be serious this s um m er .

I went to my gr and m o ther ' s house with may da d .
To day I had a j ud o ma t ch .
The comp e t i tion started at 2 P M and there were 2 5 comp e t it or s .
I have a small body but am con f id ent in my s ta m in a .
In the end , I w on the b ro n z e me d al .
J ud o is a very hard sp or t but I ' ll try hard .
H in d i come s in the th ir d place in the p op ul ation of the n at ive speak er s , for ex amp le .
Well , I will try ma k ing some sen t ence s , and the them e is `` b ir th day part y `` .

We at e to g e ther ( without our bo s s ) and my co ll e a gue s like d my dis he s .
The p h ot o of a c a ke is from the office b ir th day part y we had last year .
H i .
It is n ic e to me e t you .
My name is S u j un g and I ' m 2 2 .
I live in S e o ul .
I also want to make for e i g n friend s .
I was b or n in the year of the s n a ke .
The s n a ke s character is t ic s are straight f or w ar d .
E s pe c i ally money is an im p or t ant thing .
But they are ro man t ic is t s .
They are de v ot ed to their family .
They can dis c o ver the es s ence of a pro d u c t .
My favor ite an im al s are ra b b it s , do g s , c at s and so on .
A c t u ally I like c ut e an im al s .
I ha te s n a ke s .
E ver y time when I pro m is e other s to ful f i ll an as s i g n ment , I can a c c o m p l ish it very well even though the ta s k see m s un c on qu er able .
M or e o ver , I am afraid to dis s a p po in te other s rather than I myself .
If I do not dr in k it in the morning , I feel tired and sleep y ( You do n ' t need to a d d that )
I like different co f f e e .
It depend s on my mo o d .
When I ' m s ad , I dr in k c a p p u c c in o . When I ' m de p p re s s ed , I prefer black co f f e e .
I made up my mind that I ' m only go n n a sp en d 1 0 minute s writing my ent ri es from now on .
If I take 3 0 mi n s to write my ent ry , it always end s up get ting too long .
I know you do n ' t want to c or re c t such long ent ri es , because when I read a long ent ry in J a p an e se , it is so hard that I do n ' t w an n a c or re c t it .
I us ed to limit my time to 3 0 minute s , but 1 0 mi n s is more in ten s ive and make s me conc ent r ate more .
R e c ent ly , I ' ve got ten too us ed to this life s ty le too much , thus , I ' m get ting la z y .
When I read a new s p a p er , I still c a n ' t read well , even now .
My listen ing s k i ll s are also poor , still .
I heard that one of my friend s st ud ies for 1 0 hour s a day .
O ther w is e , his English would not be per f e c t .
To be like a n at ive speak er , of course p r a c t ic ing speak ing English is im p or t ant , but read ing s k i ll also be ar s gra v ity .
It ' s time to go to class .
S t ar ting from to day , I will try to speak English .
I ' m going to us e an on line a u ction to get a game .
I want a game called `` T H E i D O L M @ S T ER `` .
The play er ch o o se s a girl and train s to be a p op id o l .
I have never done an on line a u ction before so I ' m n er v ous .

W o ul d you please explain to me the mean ing of the sen t ence s be l ow ?

C l ock , who want s to show you how to read the time , `` I re p l i ed , try ing to person if y the clock so that she could easily make friend s with him .
I did n ' t know why I had such bad l u c k last month .
One thing which I have said in my ent ry that I was found out when I was help ing my friend to c he at in the ex a m .
I will return to my home t ow n in la ter this month and back to high school once again .
A no ther bad thing is about my second - hand b i ke , which I written an ent ry about ( `` ch ance `` written on 1 5 th , S ept e m b er last year ) , in which I explain ed how I b ough t it last year .
The st ud ent who so l d the b i ke to me st o le the b i ke in A p ri l last year .
My class m ate L i u H a o and I b ough t the b i ke direct t ly without ver if y ing the st ud ent ' s id ent if ic ation and re qu ir ing any con ta c t s or re c or d s .
D a y s a g o , my class m ate D a i B o w a w s ri d ing the b i ke outside and me t the re al own er , who p ic k ed out the b i ke im m ed i ate ly when he saw it .
Then they went to the police st ation and L i u H a o and I went to there la ter to make a re p or t .
This is the first time I have come to L an g - 8 .
I was told that at this place friend ' s will help language le ar n er s .
I want to im p ro ve my English , so I ho pe to receiv e your help ^ ^
F ro m this moment I have been b less ed
My dr e a m s came tru e because of you
There is nothing I would n ' t give
It ' s a time when many people make their re s o l u tion s for the who le year .
I do n ' t like ma k ing re s o l u tion s over long per i o d s so I will write one for this month only :
I ' m going to write at least 2 0 new po st s here by the one ( end ? ? ) of J an u ar y .
K e e p your f ing er s cross ed ; )
I b ough t the new pai r of j e an s yesterday .
A c t u ally , I want ed to bu y the new pai r of train er s so I went to a sh op p ing c ent er .
There are a l ot of n ic e sh op s there .
That day , for t un ate ly , there was a b ar g a in s al e .
The mean ing is to c he er H an s h in on .
H an s h in is a J a p an e se b a se b a ll tea m .
A n y way , I was look ing for the new pai r of train er s there .
However , I happen ed to find the n ic e pai r of j e an s when I was ha ng ing around there .
The b l u e co l or was re ally n ic e , be s id es the p ri ce was reason able .
It had about a 6 0 per c ent dis c o un t .
I c he c k ed out the train er s too , but their p ri ce s were n ' t dis c o un ted , so I b ough t the new j e an s .
I make sure not to ir ri t ate or shout her .
However , it is difficult to keep my ten s ion c al m when she see m s not to he ar me , or does the same mistake .
I thought that I had to give her the reason able explanation to per s u ad e her why her a ction or w or d s is wrong in s te ad of just de n y ing her a ction .
M o st of the J a p an e se usual ly do n ' t take much care of their re l i g ion .
However I think we depend on something with an a b s o l ut e p ow er in our in n er heart .
This re l i e f is our mo t i v ation to do the good a ction to other s if no body see s us .
I thought that ch il d re n also need th is kind of un d e f in ed , but a b s o l ut e e th ic s .
So I took her to the ch ur ch where the s is ter s tell the ch il d re n easy interest ing b i ble st or ies .
Yes ter day , the s is ter told the ch il d re n the story of a str a y she e p that ra n away from the gr o up , and got los t .
The she e p was f in ally found by the she p h er d and felt re l i e v ed .
My d aught er of ten ra n away from me , so it is a re ally good story for us !
I am B ud d h is t , but un f or t un ate ly the temple g en er ally do n ' t give this kind of s er v ic e per i o d ic ally for small ch il d re n .
I wonder why they do n ' t make more effort for ch il d re n ' s education .
It must le ad to in c re as ing of the ent h us i a st ic B ud d h is t s in the future .
H i ! all L an g - 8 me m b er s
I started la ng - 8 to day
I ho pe to speak English very well
I work hard to study English
V an D in e who was an old m aster of de te c t ive no ve l s .
H is no ve l s are `` the B en s on M ur d er C a se `` and `` the G re en e M ur d er C a se `` .
P le a se call me `` T an e `` .
I ' m a we b de s i g n er , and con st r u c t we b sit es .
I ' m le ar n ing every day to be one .
A l ot of people are g en er ous to those who want to be a we b de s i g n er .
different world
I over s l ept this morning
I should have w o k en up at 7 : 3 0 a m , but I w o ke up at 8 : 2 0 a m .
I put on my c l o th es hu r ri ed ly and went out .
F o ur t un ate ly I was not l ate for work .
I must have had the de v il ' s l u c k !
B e c a us e to day I went to the g u it ar sh op to bu y a new g u it ar .
I have already de c id ed which one to bu y and asked the sh op man age r keep it .
It did not take time for me to de c id e upon bu y ing it .
However , I did n ' t feel much pai n in my f ing er s after play ing .
I comp ar ed my new g u it ar with the old b ro k en one ( I w ro te about it previous ly .
It is a light b r ow n co l or with n y l on str ing s . ) .
To my surprise , the new one has a n ic e p ic k up s y s te m and I can do t un ing quite easily !
When you p it ch the open str ing s , a light will turn to re d or gr e en and tell you the c or re c t position of the t un er .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to my first g u it ar and voice less on in J un e !
And it would mar k ed or gra d ed .
A n s w er some question s about the / this picture .
`` What qu al it ies does person has to have in or d er to work in this place ``
And then there was a little talk about my ho b b ies ( In which I spoke about language le ar n ing )
I do n ' t know how I went , but I will know on the 1 9 th of J un e .
I ' l keep my f ing er s cross ed . : D
I j o in ed L an g - 8 to day .
But , I do n ' t have a l ot to write about .
I most ly s l ept to day .
I ' m sleep y now .
So , I study English every day .
I want to go study a b ro ad .
I will study hard .
I s this di ar y strange ?
B e c a us e I made a mistake .
A s a f e ty ti p about ra in y days for mo t or c y c le ri d er s
The per c ent age of mo t or c y c le ri d er s in T a i w an is un b el i e v ably high .
A l m o st all of my for e i g n er friend s were impress ed by the am o un t of mo t or c y c le s f le e ting on the ro ad .
B e c a us e of the in s u f f ic i en c y of the do m est ic bu s - ne t s y s te m , many people in T a i w an ch o se mo t or c y c le s for middle dis t ance mo v ing .
But when you ' re ri d ing a mo t or c y c le on a ra in y day , do not only pay
at ten tion to your front s id , but also be a w ar e of the gr ound .
Some pai n ted tra f f ic sign s written on gr ound s make it s l i p pe ry .
F l at pai n ted s ur f a ce s without any f ri ction between ti re s and the gr ound is very da ng er ous .
If you turn a corner on the pai n ted gr ound , you might los e con t ro l of your mo t or c y c le and f a ll down .
N e i ther mo t or c y c le s no r c ar s , should not b re a k the sp e ed limit on a ra in y day .
The ma s s me d i a re p or ted that Y o k o ha m a B a y S t ar s was near ly so l d to an another comp an y last month .
However the take o ver f a il ed .
That c ity was S h i z u o k a c ity .
When I heard the new s , I thought of my being able to watch the b a se b a ll game s near my house if the de al was success
me W a k an a .
I want to be able to speak English well .
When I speak English , I do n ' t know what to say .
So please tell me how to study speak ing English .
The comp an y which I want to ent er regard s English as im p or t ant , so I try to do that I can do everything . ( mean ing is un c le ar )
There are two kind s of people .
The first kind is people who are afraid to give his / her l o ve to other people because they think those who give their l o ve more are always hu r t in the end .
A no ther case are people who just give their l o ve with no thought or reason ing .
They just believe that more l o v ing will make a more beautiful world .
Some people p re ten d everything is O K with a f a ke smile when they are in front of some on e who does n ' t like them and i g no re them .
B e ing co o l is no good with a f a ke smile .
B e ing ar d ent is no good with a we a k heart .
J ust let ' s think G o d ( this un ive r se or what ever ) will pro te c t every on e includ ing me , and everything will be good . ( some things are better , a f e w are sp e c i al )
Then we can be co o l and ar d ent at the same time with a strong be l i e f .
There will be no more hu r t , just more l o ve .
1 ) You believe you need a l ot more than you act u ally need but if you got everything that you want ed you would los e your free d o m . ( sound s more natural )
When I got home , I at e some c a ke .
I always want to eat sweet f o o d s when I get tired .
I went to a po st office yesterday .
I want ed to sh i p a C h ri st m as g if t from here to J a p an .
But I did n ' t know how to do sh i p p ing .
A t first , I go o g led it then I went to a l o c al po st office .
There , I got some bo x es .
Then I pack ed the C h ri st m as g if t and c ar d s .
I was not con f id ent with my English s k i ll .
It was my first time to do in ter n ation al sh i p p ing .
He is an A m er ic an guy .
He came with me to the po st office .
And then help ed me do it .
If he had n ' t come I could not have done it .
F ri en d s are re ally im p or t ant in hu man life .
I pai d almost $ 1 0 0 for the in ter n ation al sh i p p ing co st .
S er i ous ly , it was s up er ex p en s ive !
I found many co l or ful fight ing a ir p la ne s , f ly ing in the s k y .
I dr e ame d about some on e , who sound ed like a de l ive ry guy , stand ing by my be d ro o m do or .
I heard him and I was re ally ter ri f i ed to think how some on e could ent er my a p ar t ment and even stand so close to me .
F in ally I did open ( up ) my eyes but I could n ' t see any on e .
Then I re al i z ed it was just a dr e a m .
I want to know how about to day ' s A m er ic an da i ly life ,
and their ha b it s when talk ing with people . . . .
B e c a us e I find it is hard to co m m un ic ate with them . .
My e ng l ish is poor ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

But it was re ally co o l to gr e e t the da w n .

So I p re p ar ed present for her to make a surprise .
B e c a us e she want ed to get p u z z led .

There f or e , I think it was a he at str o ke .
But I wonder if he could mo ve to a co o l er place .
M a y b e it ' s because he is 1 3 year s old .
My friend and I went to a job f a ir in the un ive r s ity town to day .
there were a l ot of students there to a p p ly for job s .
it is difficult to find a job which you want .
So I de c id ed to a p p ly for a position as an a d m in is t r at ive as s is t ant .
because my ma j or , e - co m m er ce , does not have enough pro f es s ion s off er ing position s .
I thought I could do something regard ing the c i v il s er v ic e .
I did n ' t sp en d much time to a p p ly for job s with those comp an ies .
I do n ' t care if I will be e m p l o y ed by the comp an y to which I a p p l i ed .
I just want ed to get more in ter v i e w ex pe ri ence .

A l th ough , It ' s a difficult to de s c ri b e what the story about it , I think that it ' s one of the b est mo v ies that I watch ed with in the last 2 year s .
I want you to watch it if you have an op p or t un ity .
It is in c ent r al are a of O k a y a m a C ity .
So to say , It ' s J a p an e se style big ga r d en .
It ' s my th ir d time to go to there .
I ' m living in O k a y a m a , but only been there th re e time s .
It ' s said that half of people who live s in O k a y a m a have not been to K or a ku - en .
but only 4 0 0 yen and it ' s w or th to pay for it .
She is 8 5 year s old and live s alone two and a half hour ' s train - ri d e away from where I live .
S in ce she can not walk well , she almost always stay s at home .
I us ed to visit her once a week unti l re c ent ly , but every other week now because I ' m bu s i er .
I ' ve stay ed at my gra n p a ' s place for two days with my mo m and s is .
Yes ter day was his 8 2 th b ir th day .

A ccord ing to last year ' s da ta , 43 0 0 0 0 people went to see the f i re w or k s .
The f i re w or k s was he l d at 7 : 3 0 p . m .

So I am more friend ly with L im b on g than with N as on g .
She is little b it ti m id some time s .
A c t u ally , I am not a good person for her to live with .
No w , I feel sorry for her because I ' ve made some mistake s .
C h an is my ma le friend too .
He is small , but his mind is big !
D o h an is a j un i or in co ll e g e .

I was ha p p y because I help ed her .

U n ive r s i ad e is or g an i z ed for un ive r s ity a th le te s .
However , I think there will be a l ot of pro f es s ion al a th le te s comp e ting for C h in a .
We have the f a st est ra il way and the No . 1 G D P gr ow th sp e ed .
But C h in e se people feel that life is get ting hard er .

No w , I ' m p l an n ing to take some n ation al ex a m in ation s .
In do ing job s , there are time s that we need to as k some on e for a favor .
The way of as k ing favor is very im p or t ant .
I do n ' t like a person who say s , ` B e c a us e I am a very bu s y person , would you do that ? `
S / he does not think about the other s mind .
They do n ' t care how bu s y you are .
And no matter how bu s y they are it ' s not an a p p ro p ri ate reason to as k a favor .
I got a s ch o l ar s h i p to a school in A ust ri a in or d er to study the G er man la ng u g e .
But the se days I think about my st ud ies and how I can de ve l op my s k i ll s in language quick ly all the time , so I ' ve been try ing to find some b ook s that will help me to le ar n this language .
A c t u ally , I like to study many la ng u g es .
Yes ter day at my on line English less on , I could n ' t say what I re ally want ed to say .
But at that time I was a little n er v ous , so I said `` She does n ' t like me . ``

But I have already written a l ot to day . I will write about it tomorrow and sha re some picture s .
B e c a us e I was n ' t from M at us m ot o c ity and I ' ve never listen ed to such m us ic before .
When the d ate of the M at s um ot o B on b on a p p ro a ch es , we can listen to the m us ic here and there .
A l th ough it was a ra in y day yesterday , my d aught er went to the f est i v al with her friend s .
A ccord ing to her , there were many people and it was an ex c it ing f est i v al .
As the s um m er sea s on in S h in s y u u are a is short er than in other are as , after the 1 5 th of A u g ust pass ' s by , it will be get ting co o l er and co o l er and the a ut um n sea s on will be upon us .
So far , we have stay ed at our friend ' s house and they have a b re ad make r .
They do not us e it of ten .
Well , what do I need to make a b re ad ?
I saw some f l o ur ( I do n ' t have a di ction ar y with me now , so I could n ' t find right sp el ling s ) and some dr y e a st in their c a b in e t .
I would like to try to us e the b re ad make r ti ll half way through , and the re st of the me th o d ( I could n ' t re m e m b er the right w or d in s te ad me th o d ) I am going to take the b re ad out from the b re ad make r and make the b re ad to n ic er sha pe , then put them in an o ve n to b a ke them !
As a re ce p tion is t s do n ' t O R ( is not ) just keep smile and say `` he ll o .

The a u th or of the te x t give s us a sh ock ing ex amp le about a po l ic man from L o s A ng el es who us ed police comp ut er s to find out p ri v ate i nformation about the star s .
Some people say that he did it because his ch i e f ( re c o m m en d ed ? for c ed ? ) him to do it .
But a spoke s man from the L A P D de n i ed this . .
P ro b ably the police man sea r ch ed the i nformation about the star s in or d er to se ll it to ce le b r ity ma g a z in es , and the police da ta b a se as well as the in ter ne t are place s where p ri v ate i nformation about star s is re ally easy to find .
This is all re ally s ad because the star s are all ow ed their p ri v a c y .
In J a p an , the age of a d ul th o o d is 2 0 .
It mean s I can do anything without my p ar ent s ' per mission l o l I can dr in k , s m o ke , and so on .
It is to bu y al c o h o l at a con ve n i ence st or e and dr in k it in front of my p ar ent s .
But now , I do n ' t need to dr in k al c o h o l se c re t ly .
I feel like I have much more free d o m L O L It ' s around 3 : 3 0 here , so I ' m go n n a sleep .
I w an n a study English and make friend s , so I will keep le ar n ing .

A fter play ing she smile d n ic e ly to the a ud i ence .
To day is a wonder ful day for my family .
So my hu s b and and I stay ed at home , who le day .

We enjoy ed the me al , It was very de l ic i ous .
A fter that , we sp ent all time watch ing T V only .
This was our week en d .
What do you think ?
I had my eyes i g h t t est ed by some machi ne s at the op t ic i an s .
I felt my eyes i g h t was get ting poor ( er ) re c ent ly , my con ta c t l en se s do n ' t f it me .
I want ed new con ta c t l en se s at first , but I change d my mind and got g la s se s since I found a n ic e pai r !
The de s i g n is like the re ver se of a co in .
The outside is black and the inside is w h ite .
It has w h ite ver t ical line s at the h ing es .
They ' re s ty l ish , are n ' t they ?
I put them on yesterday .
My co ll e a gue saw my face and said `` You r g la s se s are c ut e !
They look like a p and a ! ``
I like p and as al th ough I do n ' t want to become a p and a . . .
We can not live without water , but now we are now in da ng er of a `` W at er C ri s is `` . A r t ic le s are require d .
D ur ing the 2 0 th c ent ur y , the p op ul ation of the e ar th gr e w much big g er than it was in the 1 9 th c ent ur y .
A bout 7 0 % of the e ar th is co ver ed with o ce an s and about 3 0 % of it is con t in ent s and is l and s .
F a c t or ies need much fresh water to make pro d u c t s , and so much was te water come s from them .
That is still not enough to s up p ly the need s of all the people around the world .
The be st way to make a di f f er ence is to change our mind se t s and life s ty le s .
To day was such a ti r ing day .
I was ex t re m e ly b or ed with study ing for the t est .
The we a ther was very hot .
I was a little b it an no y ed .
However , how much t est ing is left ?
and h m m m I en v y that girl !
( I c a n ' t re m e m b er , even though I just finish ed watch ing it ! )
when I us ed I - po d n an o , the b at ter y of that would be re ally f a st go ne
but now when I us e i P h on e , the b at ter y is long er than it !
I can even watch 1 0 e p is o d es
without run n ing down a b at ter y better y los t !
H m m . . . with this I can cha t with many other i P h on e us er s with the P ing a p p l ic ation . I wish I could find more friend s who us e it . . . . . . . .
but I do n ' t know how I could : (
A n y way , it was f un to day . : P ha ha
I made a ro ut e ma p of my c amp us for my home w or k .
B e c a us e the s un set on the way , I could n ' t finish my home w or k .
So I will finish the re st of my home w or k tomorrow .
D o n ' t know if I should say something to them or not . . .
T w o of my co ll e gue s s m o ke inside the office .
But they never close the do or , there for e , I can s m e ll it from where I sit .
What ' s w or se , my bo s s even s m o ke s , right in front of me when ever we have dis c us s ion s and I just do n ' t have the co ur age to as k him not to s m o ke . . . . .
I will study English hard er in or d er to go to H an ku k U n ive r s ity of F or e i g n S t ud ies .
so I me m or i z e many w or d s , and watch English dr a m as and English mo v ies without sub t it le s .
also , I put p op so ng s in my M P 3 play er and I always c ar ry my M P 3 play er to listen to m us ic any time , any where .
When va c ation end s , I w o n ' t have much time to study English .
So , I study hard er d ur ing va c ation .
And we had l un ch at M A C .
It was so f un : )
But , class es are going to start tomorrow !

I am writing to comp la in about a fault y C D play er you man u f a c ture d 2 .

It has just stop p ed play ing C D s .
I tri ed to return the C D play er to the sh op , where I had b ough t it 2 , in or d er to re p la ce it with a new one .
However , a s al es man age r re f us ed to ex change it and explain ed to me that they did not provide a g u ar ant y , because it is the respon s i b il ity of the man u f a c ture r .
I de f in ite ly need this sit u ation to be re s o l v ed and I would like 2 my C D play er to be re p la c ed with a new one 2 or the old one to be f i x ed .
P le a se give 2 me the address of the s er v ic ing c ent re where I can a p p ly to f i x or change of the un it .
O r tell me what I should do or who m I can con ta c t .
As soon as you get my comp la in t please respon d 2 without de la y .

I want to over c ome those pro ble m s , so I re g is ter ed for a new sit e .
( R e ally , al th ough I have re g is ter ed for it , I have n ' t us ed it because I thought m y P C did n ' t have a mi ke .
But I found a mi ke on my P C yesterday ! )
The sit e is like t w it ter .
There ' s just one di f f er ence .
It is that you con t ri b ut e with your voice .
It ' s called `` C in ch `` !
I will p r a c t ic e those - listen ing and speak ing without a s c ri p t - a little b it at a time .
I was very ha p p y , because a l ot of people said `` H a p p y b ir th day ! ! `` to me .
R e c ent ly , I was asked which train to take by a middle - a g ed tra ve ll er on p l at f or m 1 5 at S h in a g a w a st ation .
It ' s one of the big g est st ation s in Tokyo and it ' s visit ed by more than 5 0 0 0 0 0 pass e ng er s a day .
I found the i nformation board , but it only show ed p l at f or m 2 1 - p l at f or m 2 4 are for the S h in k an s en line s , and what is more , it s English g u id e is too small to show this .
I told him that , and he said than k s to me , g i v ing a b it ter smile .
He had to wonder the big st ation a little long er with his s u it c a se which looked he a v y .
The most impress ive place I went to was A y ut th a y a .
It ' s such a p ity that I lack p h ot o g r a p h ic s k i ll !
I w or ri ed about tak ing the T O E I C B ri g e t est tomorrow .
B e c a us e I don ` t think I ' m read y for anything on the t est .
A n y way s , I ` m read ing some b ook s at the moment .
R e c ent ly , I had no mo t i v ation .
So , D o other co un t ri es have T O E I C B ri d g e t est s ?
I don ` t know what other country had the se t est s .
P le a se , can you tea ch me another country ' s s ur r ound ing ?
The T O E I C B ri d g e t est is a p ri m ar y t est .
To day I thought that a ut um n had f in ally come .
It became co l d er out on the street and I re al i z ed that I had a b s o l ut e ly no will to go out .
I also had no will to do anything at all .
F or the who le day I ' ve been sit ting do ing nothing and now that s c ar es me .

H i ~ I am a C h in e se st ud ent .

The day before yesterday , I felt like c ut ting my bang s all of the s ud d en .
A fter w ar d s I re al i z ed I had made a ter ri ble mistake .
My bang s look ri d ic ul ous ly short .
When my mo m looked at them , she star ed on at me like , `` Why did you c ut them your s el f ?
You should have go ne the s al on !
o h my go d ! `` But that was what ( had ) already happen ed , un f or t un ate ly .
No w I look a l ot better with my bang s up on my for e head .
It will take a long time to make my bang s gr ow .
To day was my work day .
It is a ( bo t t le of ) per f um e .
I told him `` No no I do n ' t need that `` , but he seemed to take off en se and I took the g if t .
This is of course p le as ant ( for me ) , but I do n ' t understand why he did it . .
he is about 1 3 year s old .
I had a b ir th day and that ' s why he ga ve me the g if t , but I do n ' t co m m un ic ate with him of ten , some time s on f ri day . .
To day the we a ther was hot !
And tomorrow it will be hot ter ! u u u g h - where is the ra in ? . . .
To day , I was f a in ted at a morning as se m b ly .
It see m s to be a part of the ment al he al th of comp an y , but I started feel ing bad .

B y the way , yesterday I me t my friend when I went to a con ve n i ence st or e .
A fter this , we went to the con ve n i ence st or e to g e ther .

M a k ing a new friend is very difficult .
The se days , I think ma k ing new friend s by in ter ne t is very difficult .
However I want to make for e i g n friend s .
To make a friend le ar n ing a second language is es s ent i al .
I will study English very hard .

No matter how difficult the job is , I ' ll per s ever e .
I went to study with my friend
I went to study with my friend to day near the B T S s al ad an g
We have been study ing English and T ha i for a long time . I was ha p p y to see her to day because last We d ne s day I did not go to study with her . I had for g ot ten that I had an a p po in t ment to study C h in e se with her .
I felt very g u il ty because
she was there already and I was at home .
So to day I said to her that I was re ally sorry for for g e t ting
She was re ally n ic e .
I was ha p p y because she was not a ng ry at me .
A fter I had finish ed study ing C h in e se .

No w I ' m read y to find a job and I will a p p ly for many comp an ies with my re s um e .
S ever al comp an ies request a high s c or e on this t est and this fact make s me n er v ous .
When I was walk ing on c amp us on the way to p ic k up my c ar , a woman stop p ed me and asked me the way to the P a v i ll ion .
I also told her to look for sign s show ing the ex a c t room she was look ing for .
The ma in st re a m of J a p an e se education
The ma in st re a m of J a p an e se education is the study of life p l an n ing .
F or ex amp le , students in j un i or high school work in their ho p ed - for o c c up ation for about a week .

To day too !
Yes ter day I a c c id ent ally found out about a very c ut e girl on You T u b e , so I started to sea r ch all her v id e o c l i p s on You T u b e and watch ed them .
My s is ter is a very sen s it ive girl
To day I have a very bad head a ch e
I am p re p ar ing for the T O E I C ex a m . The t est is on No ve m b er 3 1 st

And we will probab ly write 2 t est s tomorrow , a g e o g r a p h y t est and a c he m is t ry t est .
It ' s O K , I will s ur v ive some h ow : ) .
I j o in ed T w it ter .
But I c a n ' t understand how to us e it ex a c t ly . . .
F ir st of all I ' m read ing what other people write ( p _ - )
I have ha y f ever .
I dr in k `` T en ch a `` every day .
T h an k s to `` T en ch a `` , my no se feel s better .
I want to stop my it ch y eyes with this .
I want to have a & n b s p ; p en p al .
I want to make p en p al who live s in another country
I was dis a p po in ted .
because I thought I can one !
I re ally want to have a p en p al , but it ' s & n b s p ; difficult .
I ' m J a p an e se and living near Tokyo .
I ' m going to start writing an English di ar y to b r ing my writing s k i ll s up .
U n t il now I had tri ed for some time to write an English di ar y , but it did n ' t last .
This time I ho pe that I can keep going with other people ' she l p , and I could help other people who are le ar n ing J a p an e se .
M a y b e you can call me an O T A K U , ha ha ha .
I think I could in t ro d u ce many to J a p an e se c ul ture on this di ar y .
I did n ' t have a good re l ation s h i p with my m um when I was a te en age r .
T h ough I took after my m um a l ot , we could n ' t agree with each other for a long time .
I ' ve been living with my bo y f ri en d for two year s and I sp ent n in e month s in S y d ne y last year .
We do n ' t live to g e ther any more so we try to keep in to u ch f re qu ent ly .
G r ad u ally , our re l ation s h i p is get ting close r and close r .
E ver y time I call her , she talk s a l ot and so do I .
I feel we see m like s is ter s the se days .
I re ally have f un with her .
I did nothing this M o ther ' s D a y un f or t un ate ly but I ' ll do something great for her soon . . .
This is my first time to write an English da i ly di ar y on a we b s ite .
In fact , I am poor at English .
I ho pe that I can have a friend which want s to le ar n T r ad i tion al C h in e se , I am better at C h in e se than most C h in e se .
How to get over a co l d
I stay ed home all day because I had a little f ever .
I dr in k an en er g y dr in k before go to be d and take some me d ic in e to get over my co l d . ( my suggest ion )
I will do the same to night .
And I was ex cited about the s es s ion , as I never had ex pe ri ence d anything like it before .
The a ud i ence came in and then two A m er ic an teachers .
One , an A m er ic an lady , seemed to have much teaching ex pe ri ence , while the other one , a very you ng A m er ic an man , seemed to be a re c ent un ive r s ity gradua te .
O f course , the lady had good J a p an e se s k i ll s and manner , as she had live d in J a p an for a long time .
The s es s ion started .
F ir st , the J a p an e se ch il d re n show ed some he s it ation and were ant s y .
But soon all of them were c a p t i v at ed by the voice of the A m er ic an lady , when she read a b ook about H a ll ow e en p um p k in s .
I did n ' t think the small kid s would be able to conc ent r ate for very long .
S ur p ri s ing ly , al th ough it was the same language and the two teachers ' read ing style s were not so different , the ch il d re n be ha v ed different ly .
( G e t it over with ! ) , while the re st were listen ing quiet ly .
I b ook ed T i o man B er j a y a re s or t in M al a y s i a for the ho l i day s .
A ll of my S ing a po re friend s stop p ed my family from going there because of the M on s o on .
The M on s o on sea s on start s in No ve m b er and our tra ve l is from the 9 th of No ve m b er to the 1 1 th .
But we need some re fresh ment and are read y to enjoy the M on s o on full y .
One of my p l an s for this year is run n ing a full mar a th on in four hour s .
I run to work almost every day , and also run back home from work .
It is the ra in ing sea s on now .
I do n ' t run on ra in y days , so I feel s ad when I can not run .
We have only one month left unti l we can enjoy watch ing f ant a st ic so c c er game s .
ti ll now , K or e an so c c er play er s have been do ing their be st to make a mi r a c le again like the 2 0 0 2 K or e a & J a p an W or l d C up .
A l ot of so c c er f an s around the world do n ' t want to accept our re s ul t in 2 0 0 2 .
I can understand why they do that .
However , we should just enjoy the W or l d C up as an in ter n ation al f est i v al .
I also believe that K or e an so c c er play er s will show all for e i g n er s K or e an p ri d e and make a mi r a c le again .
Red de v il s ?
P ar k J is un g ?
O r something else ?
As soon as the W or l d C up start s , all K or e an s will we ar re d shirt s and ga ther in front of C ity H a ll , K w an g h w a m o on , and other place s .
If you are interest ed in the Red D e v il s , sea r ch it on you t u b e right now .
A l s o , if you are in the Red D e v il s d ur ing the W or l d C up per i o d s , you will be able to feel K or e an s ' pass ion .
Let ' s enjoy the W or l d C up ^ ^
K A W A S H I M A will be tra d ed to another tea m in the P re m i er L e a gue ?
H a ve you heard about E i j i K A W A S H I M A ?
He is a J a p an e se f o ot b a ll play er who play s in the J up il er L e a gue of B el g i e .
He play s for L i er se this sea s on ,
but I ` ve heard that he may be tra d ed to another tea m .
I heard We st B ro m w i ch A l b ion F C in the P e m i er L e a gue made an off er for him ,
I s it tru e ?
If that is the tru e , is he think ing about it now . . . ?
K A W A S H I M A is the be st of G o al K e e p er in the n ation al tea m ,
So I want him to do his be st .
How do you say go al ke e p er in English ?
We can also say D O Y A - G A O .
L a st D e ce m b er , I j o in ed a R un n ing C l u b in my comp an y .
N e x t O c t o b er I ' ll run a mar a th on .
It ' s my first mar a th on ever .
No w , I will p r a c t ic e it every day .
No w it ' s just a little sp ot pai n .
In fact , it will come s to be a de light after a while .
The old er we become , we s c o l d f e w er people open ly .
When I have no expect ation s about a man , I will tell him nothing even though I have some comp la in t s about his work .
In most case s , the man s c o l d ed and the man s c o l d ing are sh ar ing the pai n s to a ch i e ve a future go al .
D e c 8 th : It is a co l d day . . . .
S le e p ing U G L Y ( ? )
I over s l ept again to day when I took a n a p .
F or t un ate ly I only over s l ept a bout three hour s , not more than 1 2 hour s like last time .
It ' s not re ally a good ha b it to sleep in the day time .
If I find a job , there w i ll be no time to take a n a p .
P er ha p s I will be give n al un ch b re a k but ther e will be no time for sleep d ur ing work hour s .
So I will have to qu it tak ing a n a p .
But it ' s hard for me right now .
I got too us ed to sleep ing in .
I need to make myself start sleep ing proper ly .
On ce I pass ed my 2 4 th b ir th day , I s ud d en ly felt the p re s s ur e of not being able to was te time any more , even though my friend s still co m f or t me , saying things such as `` you are still you ng . `` I feel up se t when I as k myself , `` what have you a ch i e v ed in 2 4 year s ? ``
I think I am f a c ing my care er ch o ic e now .
On one hand , it ' s not a go l d en time for the job mar ke t for a c he m is t .
On the other hand , it may be w or th it to in ve st in a l ot of money to get a m aster ' s de g re e in A c c o un ting .
To be or not to be , is always the question .
The se days , we are le ar n ing about the hot dis p ut e over the E a st S e a .
The E a st S e a is de s i g n at ed the S e a of J a p an .
I am re ally ~ ~ up se t about that .

but I c a n ' t stop .
I will take the entrance ex a m in ation for a certain U n ive r s ity .
I ' m study ing for it right now .
I do n ' t know whether I can study a b ro ad ; it ' s up to my f in an c i al sit u ation and my English s k i ll s , but I ' m dr e a m ing about it so far .
I think going a b ro ad is a short c ut to study ing it .
T h ough I do n ' t know the ex pe ri ence in my school life affect s my future ( my o c c up ation ) , I want to become the person that think s about g l o b al affair s da i ly .
A n y way , I like English .
W ri ting in my di ar y in English make s me feel po s it ive .
M an y people like it though . But it did n ' t at t r a c t me .
Even so , I want ed to see her smile . So , I did n ' t he s it ate to go .
D ur ing that time , we enjoy ed va ri ous at t r a ction s like / includ ing a sp e c i al p ar ad e which took place at night .
A ccord ing to my girl f ri en d , she ' d / she re ally want ed to visit either Tokyo D is ne y L and or Tokyo D is ne y S e a with a bo y f ri en d .
The next day , we head ed to As a ku s a , one of the p op ul ar sight se e ing sp ot s in Tokyo .
A l th ough it was morning , there were a l ot of people , es pe c i ally for e i g n visit or s .
A c t u ally , I did n ' t expect such a c r ow d so it took me long er to go through / cross the As a ku s a ro ad .
We b ough t some so u ve n ir s for our family and friend s and after w ar d s , we went to Tokyo S t ation to take a bu ll e t train . We return ed with a l ot of stuff .
I ' m not f a m il i ar with this big c ity called Tokyo . I can / could dis c o ver more at t r a c t ive place s if I had a ch ance to tra ve l again to this out st and ing c ity .
My name is A y a .
I only speak J a p an e se .
P le a se g u id e me in the future .
This is a J a p an e se co m m on idea : `` S or M ? `` which mean s `` S e m er u or M a m or u ( off en d er or de f en d er ) `` which or i g in at ed from `` S ad is t or M as o ch is t ``

T h o se are en able d by in depend ent mind s , there f or e I sha ll call it `` le ad er `` .
I strong ly feel the ten d en c y is wide s p re ad ing es pe c i ally for you ng J a p an e se mind s .
How easy it is to see people that want to be c ate g or i z ed .
B a c k then , s a m ur a is who tra ve led in J a p an at the time of the M e i j i R est or ation were comp le te ly different from to day ' s J a p an e se mind .

And I can c or re c t people ' s J a p an e se writing .
If A b e or F u k ud a were on the to p , they would f a in t .
But many of the a u th or s of the re t re at still re m a in s there .
He re is the reason why job - hu n ting in J a p an is ter ri b ly compli c at ed .
There f or e it can be a hu g e dis ad v ant age in job - hu n ting not to work at a comp an y right after gradua tion from un ive r s ity and to be `` K I S O T S U `` .
I was surprise d about the s c al e of L an g - 8 .
My short di ar y ent ry was am en d ed by s ever al L an g - 8 people .
In addition , it was with in a f e w days .
I was glad about that .
I ho pe that my E ng l ish s k i ll s will be im p ro v ed by the help of L an g - 8 friend s .
`` V e g at ta `` is name d after the ma s c ot of my favor ite so c c er tea m , `` V e g al ta S en d a i `` .
I have been work ing in H on g K on g for 1 0 month s .
H on g K on g is quite a good c ity .
I can not speak C ant on e se .
C ant on e se is very difficult for me .
If you would like to know more about me , please feel free to con ta c t me .
R e c ent ly , my friend told me an interest ing we b s ite .
D o you us e P l ur k ?
It ' s interest ing .
This is my P l ur k .
P le a se a d d me . ^ _ ^ T h an k you .
The picture is a c ock ta il dr in k .
It is called a B - 5 2 , a f a m ous c ock ta il in b ar s .
The up p er la y er is co in t re a u and it should be co l or less , but I made a mistake in this la y er .
You c a n ' t write when you want to write something interest ing
It ' s been a long time .
I could n ' t write a j o ur n al in English re c ent ly .
Why ? ( The reason ? )
B e c a us e , I ' d write something interest ing !
As it is in my n at ive to n gue : when you want to write something interest ing , your ten s ion will l if t too much , so you will not write anything .
- D re a m co ll a b or ation -
H a ve you ever thought that one could easily read b ook s in a co f f e e sh op ?
I have also thought that many time s .
One day , my friend said , `` Why do n ' t you go to a star b u c k s in R op po ng i ! ! `` ( It is very far from the place where I live ) And of course , I thought it was c r a z y to go there ( because , you know , it co st s me a l ot of money and time to go , and there are many star b u c k s )
`` Why ? `` I said .
He con t in u ed , `` This star b u c k s works in co ll a b or ation with T s ut a y a ! !
We can read b ook s and dr in k a c up of co f f e e before we bu y them ! ! ``
I was los t for w or d s , and I was surprise d by the idea of that .
No w , I of ten go there .
I think that the p ri ce for co f f e e it s el f is very ex p en s ive .
I think it is a good in ve st ment for me .
The V an c o u ver S un R un
To day , I part ic i p at ed in the V an c o u ver S un R un , which was a 1 0 k m run even t .
B e f or e I started , I was not sure if I could run the comp le te course .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t run da i ly .
I should have p r a c t ic ed for a f e w month s before the even t , but I am a pro c r a st in at or and I and I end ed up not p r a c t ic ing at all
With o ut any p r a c t ic e , , I tri ed ( attempt ed ) the 1 0 k m run to day .
However , when they saw the finish line , they s ud d en ly d ash ed off and I was left far behind .
I did n ' t have any en er g y re m a in ing and I had pai n in my k ne es .
I wonder ed why they kept en er g y so much that they could d ash to go al in the last minute s .
A n y way , to day was a very beautiful day and we enjoy ed the beautiful view ( s ) .
I heard some great new s yesterday !
K ha b ar o v s k is a large c ity in the Russian far e a st and it take s almost 2 or 3 hour s to get to there from Tokyo by p la ne .
S e o ul is great for people who l o ve sh op p ing and have a l ot of money , but not good for ch il d re n .
I have three pro ble m s with going to K ha b ar o v s k !
The second is that it is very co l d in K ha b ar o v s k d ur ing the w in ter , so I will have to bu y a very th ic k co at to keep myself w ar m .
I will have to pro te c t myself from p ic k p ock e ting .
And some people say the police in K ha b ar o v s k are ir re s p on s i ble and dis t r ust ful , so I ' m w or ri ed about it , but I believe K ha b ar o v s k is a n ic e c ity !
F er r ar i is a man u f a c ture r of sp or t s c ar s b as ed in M ar an e ll o .
They bu il t c ar s for comp e t i tion s and la ter , in 1 947 , also began to make sp or t s c ar s .
I of ten he ar people saying `` English is need ed ! `` .
I do n ' t think so .
The im p or t ant thing is that he / she has the ability to do something .
And , if he / she can speak English , it will be an a d v ant age .
English will be an a d v ant age only when they can do something sp e c i al .
What do you think about this ? ?
To day I f le w a k ite with my ch il d re n in the ne i g h b or h o o d p ar k .
It was so w in d y that my k ite f le w very high .
It ' s the first time in their life that they watch ed a k ite f ly ing .
They enjoy ed f ly ing it .
A t the begin n ing , there were me re ly 3 different c a f e f r an ch is es .
But now , f a st f o o d sh op s and con ve n i ent st or es have p l un g ed into this co f f e e w ar .
There are over ten th ous and con ve n i ence st or es here .
E ver y hu n d r ed s te p s you can hi t 7 - 1 1 and every hu n d r ed fifty s te p s you may bu m p into F a m i ly M ar t .
In other w or d s , you can bu y a c up of co f f e e every where here .
far m er s only make under 3 do ll ar s a day .
N ever th e less , , at S t ar b u c k s the p ri ce of a c up of co f f e e is over 5 bu c k s on a ver age .
I re m e m b er my first sh op p ing ex pe ri ence on the In ter ne t in 2 0 0 3 .
I b ough t a bo t t le of mo is ture g el on e - b a y .
But I still have not receiv ed the good s .
I was c he at ed and los t the money .
In 2 0 0 7 , my second time , I b ough t s k in c ar e co s m etic s from T A O B A O .
C O M ( the we b s ite is now p op ul ar in C h in a ) , but I was all er g ic to the co s m etic s .
They se ll co un ter f e it pro d u c t s .
A l th ough I was c he at ed s ever al time s , I still bu y pro d u c t s on the in ter ne t now .
I read many ar t ic le s about how to dis ting u ish good sh op s from bad sh op s , which im p ro v ed my ability to dis ting u ish the pro d u c t s .
I have b ough t many pro d u c t s on the in ter ne t this year .
They all have good qu al ity and a l ow p ri ce .
This is my first time writing a di ar y !
I can not think of something to write .
In the first game , I ra n back because I was play ing de f en se , then I felt a p u ll in my c al f .
I was also hung ry , very hung ry !
I had s c or ed some point s , and al th ough my co ll e a gue s help ed me , I could n ' t con t in u e play ing .
I want to ex pe ri ence the th ri ll of ma k ing a great pro f it or great los s .
How and where can I make it come tru e ?
When f a c ing ch o ic es about the future , is any on e ever sure of them s el f ?
Then , they would be la b el led as a sha l ll ow and money - mind ed st ud ent .
How come ?
Some would just ful f i ll their ( sp ) pass ion s for language s , study ing different language s and ex p l or ing different co un t ri es , c ul ture s , his t or ies , c us in e , . . . . . .
Some would play it s a f e , because they have not f i g ur ed out what they want to do in this small per i o d of time .
In that case , at least they may have b as ic know led g e in that f i el d .
M a y b e .
I s this a pro ble m only happen ing to students in H on g K on g , or a g l o b al one ?
C h in e se V al ent in e ' s D a y .
To day is C h in e se V al ent in e ' s D a y in T a i w an ,
a long long time a g o ,
there was a f a ir y and a far m er who l o v ed each other .
But the f a ir y c a n ' t live among mo r t al s .
A l th ough they had two ch il d re n to g e ther , the f a ir y ' s mother took her away .
the f a ir y ' s mother agree d to let her me e t the far m er on J u ly 7 every year .
I will stay at home all day . . .
and your father as k s you not to play with the comp ut er . . . .
I ' m go n n a di e . . . = = ha ~
This b or ing S um m er V a c ation , ,
I wish this day would end quick ly
But , , I do n ' t w an n a go to school either
( t , then what can I do . . ? ? )
J i ha ad c he er s for the A r a b ic de p ar t ment at my un ive r s ity .
J i ha ad has perform ance s four time s a year .
M e m b er s of the c l u b p r a c t ic e two hour s every day .
It ' s quite difficult .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t enjoy the ex er c is e , but the reason that I ' m still in this c l u b is the re l ation s h i p s .
D ur ing c l u b act i v it ies , I make many friend s .
A L u c k y or A B ad day
To make 1 s amp le , it take s around 1 or 2 hour s .
And I got a water m el on from my p rofessor .
Then I got 2 to m at o es from my a p ar t ment ' s own er .
To day is a l u c k y day or a bad day ? ? ? ?
I can find that I will not have ex pe ri ment s any m or e , to day .
It does not look well .
When I sea r ch on the in ter ne t , I find that it ' s leave s are sick or the p ot is too small for it to gr ow .
When I was in my be d I heard a voice .
ir said that `` I can go to the end of sp a ce .
There are the high c i v il i z ation p la ne t , l ow c i v il i z ation p la ne t and a p la ne t at w ar .
The living ent it ies there are the same as a hu man being s .
D o you want to see them ? ``
I asked him ,
`` I want to see them , but how do I do that ? ``
He said `` You can do it through as t r al pro j e ction but you have to come back to your body before s un ri se .
I am still in sh ock at this un e x pe c ted thing .
This morning I brought my f in al re s ul t s and all the other do c u ment s to my a g en c y in or d er to get my for m al off er from the U n ive r s ity of S y d ne y .
1 0 sen c on d s right after I ha ng up the p h on e , a call from my a g en c y just came in tell ing me this un e x pe c ted me s s age , that my for m al off er had already receiv ed ! !
all of a s ud d en , the se pro ble m are all so l v ed , act u ally not even so l v ed , just dis a p pe ar ed , and only one op tion left !
H o pe it is s a f e to live in S y d ne y since there are always bad new s in there !
I down l o ad ed ' e c l i p se ' from the in ter ne t , last night .
R o b er t ' s p al e s k in & T a y l o ar ' a b s were f ant a st ic . . . .
w ow , , , I found sh ock ing In f o .
R o b er t & K ri s ten are a re al co up le . . . . .
they look good as a co up le . .
and there is a r um or that K ri s ten has a b a b y , , ,
may b e the mo v i e ' s pro m o tion str ate g y .
any way , , , I ' m impress ed with the mo v i e . .
so I will bu y the b ook , e c l i p se ' s original v ir s o ion .
I expect another mo v i e to come out .
I gue s s it is different in each country .
In K or e a , many , many people come to the w ed d ing ha ll
in or d er to con g r at ul ate the co up le and their f a m il ies .
F ri en d s are as s i g n ed a ro le by the b ri d e g ro o m .
One guy is the m aster of ce re m on y ,
another is in charge of the w ed d ing c ar ,
w ed d ing so ng , co un ter , or so on .
A fter the ce re m on y , people have to have a picture take n all to g e ther .
It is ex t re m e ly im p or t ant .
M ar ri ed co up le keep it as a me m or y for all their live s .
P e op le who come to the w ed d ing ha ll also have a good me al .
And once all of the s te p s are over , the co up le go on their ho ne y m o on .
That is a b ri e f s um m ar y of a K or e an w ed d ing ce re m on y .
In the past de c ad e , it has been said that people should try to in c re a se the am o un t of time they sp en d c he w ing things as much as possible .
M an y s ur ve y s have show n that people can me m or i z e things better while they are c he w ing things like g um than people who do n ' t .
A ccord ing to the new s , va ri ous s c i ent if ic e v id ence for the re le v ance between c he w ing things and bra in act i v ation have been dis c o ver ed .
However , upon try ing re m o v ing the t u b es from them and let ting them eat f o o d re qu ir ing effort , they became able to walk and talk .
My father is a l o v ing person .
when he dr un k and was in a good mo o d ,
J a p an e se k im on o , a house and the e ar th . ``
It was an express ion of his l o ve .
F or a co ll e g e or gradua te st ud ent , it ' s hard to live in a he al th y way .
I c a n ' t make it last for more than a month .
What I can do is eat f r u it s and ve g e t able s every day to get enough v it a m in s .
I went to the Tokyo D is ne y re s or t with my family .
T h ough they were very co l d , my d aught er s were very de light ed .
I will do my be st to write di ar ies .
R e c ent ly , I have be g un to study English again , because . . .
. . because I work with for e i g n people .
. . . so I de c id ed to study English every day !
M a y b en e w for e i g n people will come to our comp an y next month .
I want to talk to them po s it ive ly ! ! ! !
It is s un g by T VXQ , which is my favor ite ( m us ic ) gr o up .
There f or e , it is s un g in J a p an e se .
I act u ally like d it .
U n t il then I did n ' t know how beautiful the so ng was !
I think it has the p ow er to get ri d of my tired ness .
I asked my friend to re p ly to my ma il because she does n ' t re p ly to them some time s .
I have n ' t up d at ed my di ar y here for almost half a year .
That is because I was bu s y going to my class es .
And limit ed by C G s k i ll s , we a d d ed some sh o ot s from other mo v ies for comp le te the story .
h m m m , It ' s a little con f us ing
The st or y is about a girl who s a c ri f ic ed her s el f for she knew what bad things would happen
to make the long story short , here is the v id e o .
P e op le usual ly think s m ur d er is a b s o l ut e ly a bad thing .
And they get ha p p y when that person is k il led .
A l th ough , they got a ng ry when that person k il led people .
He was a l on er who did n ' t have friend s in re al life .
However , for what ever reason he los t all of them .
A n y way , he k il led people he had never even me t , ' c a us e he got tired of living .
( I do n ' t think it make s sen se , ' c a us e that should n ' t be a reason to k i ll people .
A n y way , he said so and I do n ' t know any m or e about it . ) In co ur t , many people who se friend s or f a m il ies were k il led by him ho p ed he would face the de a th p en al ty .
He was ar re st ed a f e w days a g o .
He is a man who want s to k i ll a man .
I have not ic ed that my English s k i ll s are so fee ble .
I ' ve even stay ed in another country to study English but it ' s still no good .
I might be able to im p ro ve my English speak ing but my gra m m ar is ho r ri ble .
So I want to as k every body how do you study a for e i g n language ?
I want to know the be st way to le ar n a for e i g n language . . . . .
I know the name of it , though I have n ' t st ud i ed it serious ly .
In the class , we took the w or d `` l un ch `` as a ro ot for the mind m a p at first .
B as ic ally , a mind m a p has one ro ot and some bra n ch w or d s re la ted to the ter m , then the de ta il s m ul t i p ly just like bra n ch es of a tree .
It ' s a us e ful too l for me to bra in st or m and think about things de e p ly .
I will study more and m aster it to become a more so p h is t ic at ed ( re s o ur ce ful ; ) man .
I want ed to watch w ome n ' s f i g ur e s k at ing but it is too l ate .
I will probab ly work l ate at the office tomorrow too .
I re c or d ed the f i g ur e s k at ing pro g r a m .
F or ex amp le , s um m er f est i v al s , be a ch es , f i re w or k s so on . .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to everything .
D o you have p l an s for s um m er ?
B e c a us e it co st s so much money , I have to work part - time
I re n ted a d v d .
It ' s name d / called `` S e ve n `` .
I watch ed it last night .
I was impress ed with B r ad P it t ' s perform ance of he at ed d ur ing the last scene .
There was ha t r ed and con f l ic t .
To m or r ow is the first day of R a m ad an , which mean s that I must n ' t eat or dr in k anything all day long , from da w n ti ll s un se t , for a month .
A c t u ally , it ' s an am a z ing month ; I le ar n a l ot from it , it make s me know how poor people feel when they are very hung ry but c a n ' t eat anything - not even a little b re ad , al th ough it ' s very c he a p ! !
A l s o , it tea ch es me s el f - con t ro l : I have f o o d , I re ally want it , I need it and I ' m able to eat it but I do n ' t , just because I must n ' t and nothing else .
So I re al i z e , if I can do that and other people can too , that mean s that g i v ing up s m o k ing or dr in k ing is n ' t im po s s i ble either .
I be l on g to the de p ar t ment of me d i a de s i g n of the H o k k a id o In st it ut e of T e ch no l o g y .
A f e a ture of a s ta m m er ing person is that they s ta m m er un c on t ro ll ably .
They also s ta m m er in front of a person they are in t im ate with .
The cha ir m e e ting was done in the home ro o m every morning .
It did not worry every on e else .
A fter I had come home , I c ri ed b it ter ly .
I was too sleep y to mo ve my body s m o o th ly .
Then , when I got home , I at e b re a k f a st and read some new s p a p er s .
That made me l ate for class .
I ' m wonder ing whether to bu y a be d or not .
We sp en d such a long time sleep ing in our life .
So , it ' s probab ly better to bu y an ex p en s ive one ,
It ' s good for me to just sleep , but when you look at a ma t t re s s ly ing on the floor , the room look s me s s y .
And I can put a l ot of stuff under the be d .
The se are the reason s why I want to bu y a be d .
It ' s a new ter m , so I ' m very ha p p y !
In school , I can study with my friend s and I can le ar n some new sub j e c t s .
This ter m we a d d ed two new course s : ma th and g y m . I like g y m .
I am not good at ma th , but I will do my be st to le ar n ma th . I believe my ma th will become better .
D o es he know or not ?
He re is a con ver s ation between him and myself the other day .
D o you want to go to an o y s ter b ar ? ``

I went to G re e ce with my bo y f ri en d in S ept e m b er 2 0 0 4 , soon after A th en s O ly m p ic .

A t that time G re e ce was full of tra ve l er s from around the world .
We enjoy ed walk ing along the se ash or e , eat ing G re e k dis he s , and c y c ling around the is l and .
It was very w in d y every day , and it was co o l to s w im in the sea .
I ho pe to tra ve l to other beautiful is l and s in the A e g e an S e a some day .
I did n ' t do so well on the small listen ing t est .

What happen ed after ?
when did you find a future pro ble m and f i x it before it got bad ? .
T e ll me about a time when you had too many things to do and you did them one by one ?
Some people take sick leave for a f e w month s because they s u f f er f ro m de p re s s ion .

It is n ation al qu al if ic ation that is so very difficult .
R e g ul ation s and st i p ul ation s are es pe c i ally con f us ing .
I think I will con t in u e my st ud ies every day .
How to K e e p He al th y
How to keep he al th y ?
A l ot of people start to care about this . Why ? L if e is more interest ing and all of us want to live long er to see something we have never see n , never heard and never to u ch ed .
No w I want to sha re my idea s with you .
We are living with pro ble m s . W or k pro ble m s , family pro ble m s , money pro ble m s and stuff that we have to so l ve . If we can not so l ve them , we will feel a little b it down . So we need to v ent and re la x to b al ance our life . We can go out for a va c ation , watch a mo v i e , listen to the m us ic , do some ex er c is es or just have a n ic e sleep to make our s el ve s better . Some time s I do , and I have a l ot of way s to re la x .
F in ally , you can try to k ic k the bad ha b it s . You know it is bad for you , but you just c a n ' t stop . J un k f o o d , get ting dr un k , dr u g s and s m o k ing are all bad ha b it s . Why not just take them away ? If you want to , there ' s no ex c us e and nothing can stop you .
everything is possible , please believe in your s el f and a ction now .
I ho pe you can have a body as he al th y as mi ne .

I work ed all the time d ur ing my sp r ing va c ation .
It was very hard . > < `` ``
But I man age d to do it .
This is a very short di ar y because I have n ' t had much free - time .
S e e you next time . . . .
W al k ing and T e m p le s
Yes ter day , my friend and I had a im to visit temple s of different re l i g ion s .
But we could visit only two , because I did n ' t w a ke up e ar ly - _ - ~ ~ ~ as usual .
In the after no on , I also had less on s in mo s qu e .
When my less on finish ed , we went to c ent er of our c ity and de c id ed to begin from there because there is many of temple s and other re l i g i ous or g an i z ation s .
A c t u ally there are temple s of O r th o d o x C h ri st i an ity ( of course this ch ur ch has p ri v i le g e ) , a C a th o l ic C h ur ch ( I know only one , al th ough there may be one some where else , I do n ' t know for sure ) , P ro t est ant ch ur ch es and M o s qu es . On the In ter ne t , I read that there was a s y n a g o gue being bu il t in 1 99 8 , in No v o s i b ir s k , but I did n ' t find it on the ma p .
N e x t time , I ' m going to go to the place where it has to be .
Yes ter day , I went to C a th o l ic and O r th o d o x ch ur ch es .
We were re ally f ri g h ten ed , in the begin n ing , to go inside .
I do n ' t know why , but we were more afraid to go in O r th o d o x ch ur ch , so we went to C a th o l ic one .
A a h , we began from the cha pe l .
It is on the picture .
This cha pe l is consider ed as the c ent er of R us s i a .
We did n ' t go inside , because it ' s small and we did n ' t know what we would do if
we entered . . ~ ~
I will write about another in my next po st . .
It will help me be to more care ful writing the the s is .
The show er no z z le in my bath ro o m has already been f i x ed so I am so ha p p y .
It take s about 3 month s to be f i x ed .
We ' ve go ne there a f e w time s since we got mar ri ed .
A tri p to the D is ne y re s or t s at this time of year is our an n u al even t .
E ver y time I visit Tokyo D is ne y re s or t , I find it a re ally c r a z y place .
I wonder what it is about the D is ne y re s or t that at t r a c t s people .
I have been watch ing the T V dr a m a `` He ro es `` .
The sea s on I ' m watch ing now is four th and f in al sea s on .
No matter what , I can not make sen se of some character s ' a b il it ies , but I still enjoy watch ing the show .
He r body is re p a ir ed a ut o m at ic ally and ra p id ly after an in j ur y .
If she c ut her f ing er , it will he al with in a f e w second s .
He r e y e b r ow s are where I found the mistake .
C er tain ly she p l u c k s her e y e b r ow s .
Why do n ' t her e y e b r ow s gr ow back just as quick ly ?
That was p le as ant , but it had a f at al draw b a c k : after the s a un a , I was so a k ed with s w e at d ur ing sleep ing .
I thought I should do something more re la x ing .
They are b r ow s ing sit es about world / do m est ic his t or ies , and watch ing v id e o s about tra ve ling to r ur al are as , while ly ing on the be d and dr in k ing be er .
The l at ter make s me think about where I ' ll tra ve l when I have the ch ance .
They both re la x me , and I ' ll be able to get up with a fresh feel ing even on M on day morning
B el ow is my short di ar y .
In a J a p an e se ma p , J a p an is l o c at ed in the c ent er of the world .
I enjoy ed b ow ling with my co ll e a gue s , e i g h t people , includ ing me .
We were di v id ed into two tea m s of four people and ma t ch ed up .
P le a se read and think about the feel ing Y O U will me e t !
I started writing a di ar y in English to day .
I ' m not good at English , but I want to le ar n it .
this is my first English di ar y
I enjoy ed the new s that ' N ud e ' p h ot o s were see n on a b an k er ' s P C d ur ing a live T V in ter v i e w by B B C new s
I watch ed the as t on ish ing moment on you t u b e
I do n ' t know if he act u ally mean t it , ' c a us e I am p l an n ing to go some where for tra ve l after the ex a m s are over .
M a y b e I would have change d my mind then and just want ed to stay put .
like a re b ir th in my spirit u al world
who know s from which country you come from in or d er to help me on this we b s ite .
So , I say to you `` T h an k s so much ! `` .
I ha te dr i v ing ! ! !
S in ce I ' ve been p r a c t ic ing dr i v ing a c ar all day
My m us c le s are a ch ing now .
I ' m not sure that I can pass the t est . .
I re ally did n ' t like the C h in e se teacher who shout ed to tea ch me .
I was y el led at by the teacher when I was in dr i v ing ,
I re ally want ed to get away from that place .
A n y way I do n ' t like such r ud e C h in e se people .
B e c a us e there was no need to shout at people . . .
I think It ' s too much trouble to le ar n how to dr ive a c ar in C h in a .
I wish I were le ar n ing to dr ive a c ar in J a p an .
I p l an to sleep e ar ly to night because of the t est tomorrow .
I want friend s in for e i g n co un t ri es
but I do n ' t speak English well .
I am try ing to le ar n English .
P le a se give me a d v is e .
To day , I c ook ed c ur ry and ri ce for dinner .
I like c ook ing , but I ' m a bad c ook .
To day , they said , `` O h , c ur ry and ri ce again ! ``
and `` Why do n ' t you c ook other dis he s ? ``
I ' ll try to c ook new and ta s ty dis he s .
Yes ter day , I went sh op p ing with my family .
The se days , many st or es are having a s um m er s al e in J a p an .
So , I was look ing for w ar d to bu y c l o th es or sh o es .
And I b ough t 2 sh o es and a long s k ir t .
In to t al , it co st ed around 3 0 0 0 j a p an e se yen .
F ro m now on , almost all st or es will c ut p ri ce more .
So , I ' m look ing for w ar d to it : - ) But I should mind not to was te money : - o
The / My first di ar y ent ry
I started us ing L an g - 8 !
I am interest ed in English too .
It s / The de ad line is D e ce m b er , 2 2 ( n d ) .
Then , I play ed with my pe t C h i h u a h u a .
He is w h ite .
I felt re la x ed when I play ed with him .
Well , I have l ot s , I mean , T O N S of friend s who go to the se f a m ous un ive r s it ies .
No t only that , but they are re ally enjoy ing their live s .
And I ' m N O T .
I wish I could , but I have n ' t found anything I want to do yet .
R e t ur n to home . G o ing back home
I wait ed at the bu s stop in K y o b ash i .
I of ten us e the bu s when I return home .
I can us e the sub way too .
The sub way is f aster than the bu s .
The c ity tra n s p or t ation bu re a u dis c o un t fee for tra n s it pass e ng er is tra n s it sub way to bu s or bu s to sub way .
So I go to K y o b ash i by sub way , and return home by bu s .
J ust a question .
in English .
P le a se tell me why they say it like that .
I have almost re c o ver ed from my co l d .
I watch ed D r a g on B a ll a little while a g o .
D r a g on B a ll is an old J a p an e se an im ation .
It is being re b ro ad c a st at present .
I l o ve D r a g on B a ll .
It is not too much to say that I gr e w up with G o ku , ve g it a , k ur ir in who are character s in D r a g on B a ll .
I have heard that D r a g on b a ll is very p op ul ar all over the world too .
I get hot so easily .
The he at w a ve is expect ed to con t in u e for a while .
But , to day the ra in was te e m ing down .
A fter the ra in , the he at has let up quite a b it .
This s um m er has been es pe c i ally hot .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to the co o l f a ll we a ther .
B ir d s never let me sleep .
It ' s get ting w ar m er , b ir d s are s ing ing and the ch er ri es tree s are wait ing to b l o s s o m
E ver y morning , b ir d s w a ke me up . They never leave me alone .
However , my w if e C A N stay in her dr e a m world .
I took `` f ut on `` and said .
`` He y , raise and sh in e ! ! ``
I think s we should be do ing the op po s ite ro le s .
To night there was a very strong st or m .
The thunder was so in ten se that the w in d ow s t re m ble d and c ar al ar m s sound ed .
And then there was ra in f a ll .
We had not had such st or m for a long time .
The last day of this year
To day is the last day of this year .
I left my home town in A k it a P re f e c ture .
I started a new life in N i i g at a P re f e c ture .
E ar ly this year , I s u f f er ed from a l ot of an x i e ty , but I quick ly got a c c ust ome d to my new life than k s to my friend s .
I think I had a good year .
G o o d morning , every on e .
I can see the s un to day .
I will go out to ri d e my b ic y c le .
And be s id e the ri ver , there is a b i ke p a th .
So I can ri d e my b ic y c le with a great view in the co m f or t able w in d .
E ver y th ing is me s s ed up ! !
Let me talk about a serious pro ble m I ' m having .
because my room m ate s had to return to J a p an by the end of F e b r u ar y .
I pai d it re l u c t ant ly , and now I de s p er ate ly have to look for some room m ate s for my a p ar t ment .
O ther w is e , I c a n ' t go to E ur o pe
because I w o n ' t have enough money !
If I found one I could get about $ 7 5 0 .
I feel f r ust r at ed that I c a n ' t do anything by myself .
If we had looked for some people f aster I ' d had found some room m ate s e as i er ( O r soon er ? ) .
I ' m wait ing for respon se from some on e as soon as possible .
And now , per ha p s I might have in s o m n i a or be so r t of an or e c t ic .
The se are re al bad things !
No w I ' m going to talk about tra ve ling d ur ing last s um m er va c ation with my friend s .
F ir st I ' ll talk about fish ing in the H on g ch e on R ive r on the first day , s w im m ing on the second day , and then f in ally c l im b ing M t .
On the first day of our tra ve l s , we left S e o ul e ar ly by bu s .
We had always looked for w ar d to going fish ing , so we were very ex cited on the way there .
We ar ri v ed at H on g ch e on and un p a c k ed our l u g g age once we re a ch ed our room s .
T ow ar d no on we head ed to w ar d the near b y H on g ch e on R ive r .
On ce there , we fish ed with ro d s which we had p re p ar ed for the ri ver .
But we only c aught e i g h t mi n n ow s because this was . our first time ( going ) fish ing .
We made sp ic y fish so up for l un ch ( by ) us ing mi n n ow s that we had c aught yesterday .
, We then went to the H on g ch o en R ive r again and s w a m .
But it quick ly b or ed us , so we change d our mind and went ra f ting .
We asked our ho st about it , and were able to enjoy ing ra f ting .
We ra f ted / went ra f ting for about two hour s .
As we had expect ed , it was very interest ing .
On the th ir d day , we left for So k ch o c ity around ten o ' clock in the morning .
M t . S or a k , which we were going to c l im b , is the ma in pe a k of G an g w on P ro v in ce .
It was my first time c l im b ing it with friend s .
It was a little b it l ate so we ch o se the short course called ' G w on g um s un g ' by c able c ar .
When we were c l im b ing , one of my friend s sp r a in ed his an k le , so he un f or t un ate ly had to head back down with our other friend .
But I was able to go up to the s um m it and get back with my friend s .
I had a l ot of ex pe ri ence s d ur ing a short time d ur ing this tri p .
No w I c a n ' t go tra ve ling with friend s for a while because they are in the ar m y .
But this tri p still re m a in s in our heart s as a ha p p y me m or y .
It ' s re ally my ha p p y day to day .
I will let my sh op open in A p ri l 1 st
I got my con f id ent from it .
It make me glad that I can do something well by work ing hard .
But my study is still b ro k en my heart .
I thought it is n ' t be l on g to me .
M a y b e , it ' s time to give up now .
It is n ic e to me e t you .
I am an office work er in J a p an .
No w , I do n ' t need to us e English at work , but I want to change job s to one which require s English .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to it very much .
Even though it is still l ate J un e , the a ir te m p er a ture became 3 1 de g re e c el c i us in Tokyo to day .
I s w e at a l ot do ing almost anything .
It is still hot and hu m id , but I have to go to a c l in ic to take a p re s c ri p tion for me d ical in s ur ance .
A fter I visit the c l in ic , I should go to a comp an y I work ed at before to as k my ex - bo s s to write a re f er ence for me , so I can a p p ly to a di p l o m a course .
My d ut y still con t in u es , when I finish to talk ing to the bo s s , I have to go to a mo t or b i ke sh op to re ne w my b i ke in s ur ance .
T im e f l ies when we enjoy it , one year has pass ed since I b ough t the b i ke for the first time in my life last J u ly .
I do n ' t know what is the be st thing to do .
I me t a business man on a train about se ve n year s a g o .
We both found a va c ant sea t and off er ed it to each other .
When I had a pro ble m with my ex - bo y f ri en d , I sen t an e m a il to him , because his n ation al ity was same as my ex - bo y f ri en d ( or just ex ) .
He ga ve me many suggest ion s and I started call ing him `` D ad d y `` after many e - ma il s .
F or se ve n year s I sen t some e m a il s ir re g ul ar ly when ever I had pro ble m s .
He is a ment or in my life and off er ed to s up p or t me f in an c i ally when I de c id ed to study in the N e ther l and s .
But I re f us ed it because this was my dr e a m .
A fter this , he a d op ted two girl s .
R e c ent ly he off er ed me f in an c i al s up p or t again .
He is going to re t i re .
He said that I and other you ng people are see d s of ri ce .
He would like to in ve st in me and you ng people as a see d of future .
But I am not sure I am a see d or not .
I still do n ' t even know what I will be or can be .
I just wish he would us e his money for his own ha p p i ness and can always be ha p p y .
B e c a us e I do n ' t know ( if ) I can make him ha p p y .
In addition , I have not see n him since that 1 5 minute s cha t on the train se ve n year s a g o , but this is tru e story . . .
F ir st I m p re s s ion
To day I w o ke up 9 : 3 0 am .
I b ough t some b ook s at K in o k un i y a b ook st or e .
F or almost one and a half month s I have stop p ed watch ing mo v ies in English .
The s um m er he at make s me tired and cause s me to los e mo t i v ation to study English .
S t i ll , I want to start watch ing mo v ies in English again to im p ro ve my listen ing s k i ll s .
Yes ter day , I watch ed `` H a p p y F e e t `` in English .
A ll the pe ng u in s in the mo v i e looked very c ut e .
I was re ally surprise d by how they mo v ed .
S in ce the m us ic that I listen ed to in the mo v i e was very p op ul ar , I re ally enjoy ed both watch ing and listen ing to it .
It see m s to be c ri t ic i z ing us .
I sat down in front of him without talk ing at l un ch .
I was too tired to say anything though , I ( just ) could n ' t talk .
I e m a il ed him this morning about our p l an s for tomorrow .
I sea r ch ed for some of his favor ite re st a ur ant s .
`` W h i ch one would you like to go to tomorrow ? `` I asked , but he did n ' t re p ly .
There ' s no answer , no re p ly , I ' m just talk ing to myself . ( ? )
I just want to know his answer , `` y es `` or `` no `` .
A H H H H H , after all this , I know I ' ll for g e t everything when I see his smile .
I am so st up id ! ! !
I just want to hi t him right now ! ! !
I ' m so s ad to day .
To day is s un n y .
English make s me ha p p y !
I dr an k he a v i ly !
S w e e t b a b y by e by e , I ' m so s ad .
R e c ent ly , I p r a c t ic ed writing with a p en .
One day my mother said , `` when you write u g ly character s you say that your face is u g ly . ``
I think it was ex t re m e but right to some ex t ent because character s you write are a kind of in ter f a ce between you and other s .
They will also have a C h ri st m as c a ke with their family .
they are not always ne ce s s ar i ly C h ri st i an . . .
In this study , there f or e , we in ve st i g at ed whether or ally a d m in is ter ed A x it in i b could ex er t it s ant i an g i o g en ic f un ction in a l as er - in d u c ed C N V an im al mo d el to e v al u ate it s p ot ent i al for the treat ment of ne o v as c ul ar A M D .
I l o ve co m ic s .
I think one piece is the co m ic k ing ! ! !
It s very interest ing , and very mo v ing !
He is a great sword s man , and a tru e man .
I want to go a b ro ad in s um m e e e e er va c ation ! !
But I do n ' t know where is good for tra ve ling X3
F or ex amp le , in a c a p it al is t ic so c i e ty , there are comp e t i tion s between comp an ies so s er v ic es can be better because people comp e te among each other and the qu al ity of s er v ic es get s better .
S e c on d ly , comp ar ed with co m m un is m , c a p it al is m is better because people comp e te among each other so when they are success ful their s al ar ies will in c re a se .
On the other hand , in a c a p it al is t ic ( co m m un is t ? ) so c i e ty , s al ar ies are the same so people do not try hard because even though they try hard , their s al ar ies are the same .
The de m er it s of c a p it al is m would be if you los e in the comp e t i tion , you may not get a bo n us so the s y s te m is good for w in n er s , but it may not be f re n d ly to los er s .
So , in a c a p it al is t ic so c i e ty , there is a need for a s a f e ty ne t so even the los er s can live ha p p i ly as well as w in n er s .
Some of the pro s of c a p it al is m are that in c a p it al is t ic so c i e ty , comp e t i tion make s the s er v ic e and pro d u c t better and people try hard to get high er bo n us es .
They are when they los e in comp e t i tion s they may not get a bo n us or salary so they might need a s a f e ty ne t so they could at least get a salary .
As I w ro te in my previous ent ry , I got my be st s c or e so far on the last T O E I C ex a m .
S ur p ri s ing ly , I got 1 0 0 per c ent on one part of listen ing se ction .
To day is E le ction D a y in J a p an .
My co w or k er , who has been work ing with us for five year s , is qu it ting his job .
I ho pe I w o n ' t be hung over tomorrow .
I have n ' t st ud i ed the English a c c ent so I still do n ' t speak English well .
I still do n ' t like to study the English a c c ent .
When I was study ing the English a c c ent I did n ' t study it for long .
I do n ' t like that I have to put my to n gue on my te e th .
I have heard that J a p an e se people s ' English is we ir d because of the English a c c ent .
We do n ' t study a l ot about the English a c c ent .
We almost always only study English is that written and read the language .
We do n ' t speak us ing English .
My teacher said : `` We re ally do n ' t need to speak English in J a p an .
It ' s require d to live a b ro ad or if you work in comp an y which require s you to speak English . ``
R e c ent N e w s . = S n ow . . . =
I ' m going to speak about the new s re c ent ly .
P e op le s u f f er ed d u e to the s n ow and it was so hard .
B e c a us e of s n ow , M or e than 3 0 0 c ar s were st u c k on the ro ad .
and they ( in their c ar s ) s l ept for one night .
No w , They have been re s c u ed by the G r ound S el f D e f en se F or ce .
And f in ally , the s n ow was 1 3 8 c m ( = ma x im um ) between the 2 5 th and 2 6 th .
but , to tell you the tru th , I have n ' t see n any s n ow in my are a this year yet .
What do you think about it ?
I ' m b or ed . . .
S ame place to go , same people to me e t , same s ch ed ul e . . .
The w or st thing is , the we a ther is not good to day . . .
I mi s s my friend s , but it is hard to me e t them for va ri ous reason s ; mar ri age , mo v ing . . .
R o o m
R e c ent ly I thought of co or d in at ing the room .
but unti l now I did not consider it ,
and it ' s difficult to find a b al ance because my room is ta ta m i .
I will do my be st to make a n ic e room !
The R est a ur ant I L i ke the M o st
I like to eat at the re st a ur ant near N a g o y a S t ation called `` O r ch id G ar d en `` the most .
It ' s a bu f f e t - style re st a ur ant that serve s me al s b as ed on certain them es that change every month .
In addition to it s great me al s , it has a n ic e view of train s .
There f or e , the re st a ur ant is p op ul ar not only for those who like to have de l ic i ous dis he s but also for those who like to watch train s , such as small ch il d re n .
I can not stop !
When I am do ing something pleasure I could n ' t stop myself .
When I am watch ing one mo v i e I want to watch it again ( ? ) .
But if I watch it again I mi s s out on my study time .
So I should stop having ' f un time ' after watch ing a mo v i e .
It ' s bad when I sp en d a l ot of time on the in ter ne t .
I ten d to be on the in ter ne t unti l I want to sleep .
I should de c id e the time when I should stop going on the in ter ne t .
But I thought `` If I do n ' t say anything , my part n er c a n ' t tell me anything `` , so I said everything I just had thought with co ur age : )
L a st night I had gr il led me at for the dinner at a re st a ur ant with my family .

The la ke has not f ro z en at all for twenty year s .
I re al i z ed then that the is s u e of the en v ir on ment is re ally serious .

D id you know that ?
I enjoy listen ing to m us ic , but for now I have de c id ed to listen to e ng l ish m us ic only .
H i there !
I was very me l an ch o ly yesterday ,
because I re m e m b er ed about my high school days .
I got a p h on e call from my be st friend s from high school .
They are ( my ) p re c i ous friend s .
As I live far away from ( my ) home t ow n , I c a n ' t me e t there , but only one or two time s per year .
It is rather l on e ly ,
but I ' m p l an n ing to return to my home t ow n this sp r ing !
I ' ve finish ed work for to day !
I ' m very tired and I have a pai n in my l ow er back .
I ' m d y ing for a show er , and I want to go to be d e ar ly to night .
P le a se c or re c t anything I write .
I took an English ex a m called G T E C to day .
The sub j e c t was listen ing and writing .
I found it difficult .
I do n ' t think I will s c or e very well .
I a im to do better next time !
My last part time job has just finish ed to day !
I have work ed only a f e w time s a month in three month s , but there are many good people in my work p la ce so it was a good ex pe ri ence : D
I a p p re c i ate meeting people !
I will live in Tokyo for a change , and I think it will be an op p or t un ity to me e t many people .
I took an English con ver s ation train ing last F ri day and S at ur day at my comp an y ' s O s a k a head qu ar ter .
The train ing was perform ed comp le te ly in English .
There were three different class es a ccord ing to one s English le ve l .
A l th ough I part ic i p at ed at the high est le ve l , I was surprise d that every on e was able to speak English f l u ent ly .
A t first , we ga ve a present ation in terms of our work in or d er to le ar n how to effect ive ly talk English .
A G o o d present ation in English need s three part s : p re v i e w , body and re v i e w , that is the same as in J a p an e se , I think .
The p re v i e w part includ ed gr e e ting , ti t le , object ive and a g en d a .
My present ation did n ' t includ e even an object ive and an a g en d a because I ga ve a part of previous present ation I us ed at a meeting .
On the second day , we had a second ch ance to give our present ation .
That purpose of the second present ation was to c he c k our present ation were act u ally im p ro v ed because of the f is t day ' s le c ture .
The night of the first day , I p re p ar ed my present ation hard and p r a c t ic ed what I would talk about again and again .
O w ing to hard s el f - study , I man age d to give a good present ation .
A t the second present ation , the other four n at ive in st r u c t or s ga ther ed around just in or d er to as k question s and give commen t s after our present ation .
The ir English was so easy that it was not so difficult for me to answer their question s .
As another less on , we le ar n ed how to con d u c t business meeting in English by ro le play ing .
We st ud i ed the im p or t ance of l o g ical think ing in English , which was the same as in J a p an e se .
A l s o , the class was he l d to t ally in English .
The se / those circumstance s gradua l ly change my think ing from J a p an e se to English .
I think `` a co up le of `` is a us e ful express ion when you speak English .
I ' m study ing English to p re p ar e for T O E F L t est ( J u ly 1 0 th ) , but I have no n at ive friend s so I ' m trouble with the writing ta s k .
I p r a c t ic ed writing some es s a y s for the T O E F L t est , but I c a n ' t tell whether the se es s a y s are c or re c t or not .
So will you please help me to ex a m in e my es s a y s ?
The se are my es s a y s
There are two reason s for this : ha r m ful ga s and g l o b al w ar m ing .
M or e o ver , ga s o line , which is f u el for a ut o m o b il es , is made from f o s s il f u el s such as co al and o il , and the pro ce s s of ma k ing it may also need f i re , which cause s C O 2 .
I think that this is a very serious pro ble m , not only for the e ar th but also for our live s .
F or ex amp le , the high er the g l o b al te m p er a ture is , the high er the sea le ve l will be and as a re s ul t , some is l and s will s in k . O f course people who live on the se is l and s will have to leave their country .
M or e o ver , g l o b al w ar m ing will do ha r m to a g ri c ul ture .
A ccord ing to re c ent re se ar ch , the p ri ce of ve g e t able s has been in c re as ing for s ever al year s , and this is because the
te m p er a ture has been in c re as ing .
If g l o b al w ar m ing last s , our live s will be de st ro y ed some day , and the se effect s are ma in ly cause d by dr i v ing a ut o m o b il es .
One reason is that appear ance tell s us a l ot of things about how he
or she is , and the other reason is that j ud g e ment b as ed on appear ance or c l o th ing is more re l i able than j ud g e ment b as ed on any other things .
A ccord ing to re c ent re se ar ch , we can get more than 8 0 % of i nformation about other ' s character is t ic s b as ed on look s .
This mean s that when we make j ud g e ment co un t s on appear ance , we can know his or her character is t ic s
M or e o ver , c l o th es express a person ' s id ent ity .
When you look at a l ot of ma g a z in es , you can find that people think of c l o th es as a way to express how they are .
There f or e , appear ance and c l o th ing give us a l ot of us e ful i nformation .
or c l o th ing is better than j ud g e ment b as ed on any other things is that the for m er is more re l i able than l at ter .
To begin with , when you believe other ' s state ment s , you can not know whether they are tell ing a lie or not .
However , when you know who they are or what c l o th es they we ar you can .
In addition , when you me e t other s for the first time , you are not be able to make j ud g e ment s as to what their character is t ic s are .
F or the se reason s , j ud g e ment b as ed on appear ance or c l o th es is more re l i able .
To day is the second day of the s k i in st r u c t or ex a m .
My first ex a m in er was C o l in who took charge of me . In s te ad of `` for ``
I could almost catch everything that my ex a m in er said in our less on ( s ) .
I listen ed to the new s on the ra d i o in the morning .
The se people must be more s us c ept i ble to he at str o ke s than people who can b re a k a good s w e at .
I just s w e at a little if it is a very hot day like 34 de g re es .
I ' m going to p r a c t ic e s w e at ing well by do ing Y o g a .
D o you s w e at well ?
I started school at the age of six , but this is not usual ly when ch il d re n start school .
U s u ally ch il d re n start school at the age of se ve n .
My teacher told me that I read at the le ve l of a six th for m er .
But to day I want to tell you about what I am read ing now , not in Russian , but in English ; )
As I said , one of my ho b b ies , and also my pro f es s ion , is se w ing .
The picture s in the b ook help me to understand it s te x t better .
It ' s very simple to understand and full of o b v i ous case s .
I have n ' t open ed it in about a month , because I have n ' t had enough time to .
If I man age to us e it with e a se , I w an n a make my own mo us e over English - English di ction ar y for F i re f o x .
Some of my friend s call me P re s id ent O b a m a because they think I look like him , but I do n ' t think I do .
I like play ing v id e o game s on X b o x 36 0 and listen ing to m us ic .
I l o ve an im al s , so I have a do g called `` M il k `` . I name d her that because she look s like a co w , but she is not f at .
In the future , I am going to get a p ar ro t because my favor ite an im al s are b ir d s ! !
Besides , my mother does n ' t like an im al s too much , so I think I want to live by myself .
That ' s all for my in t ro d u ction .
most of the J a p an e se students think salary should not be ne g le c ted .
So the most im p or t ant thing is to sea r ch for a job [ that ] we re ally want to do .
In hi n d s i g h t , it was a difficult for me to con t ro l the pro g re s s of this class .
F ur ther m or e I could n ' t re a ch a conc l us ion because I could n ' t catch their opinion s a c c ur ate ly .
In any case it was a good time for me to b r us h up on my English .
A l th ough the G ot th ar d B a se T un n el in S w it z er l and will be long er when it open s for tra f f ic in 2 0 1 7 .
The F a m ous b as ke t b a ll play er Ya o M ing is re t ir ing from N B A .
But if we get everything , are we ha p p y ?
We should think of which we re ally need .
The simple life give s me pe a ce and quiet .
As time went on , the sit u ation ( only ) got w or se . The ma in character and his family es c a p ed from the st or e in their c ar .
A fter dr i v ing a long time , they ra n out of ga s and were s ur r ound ed by mo n s ter s .
The ma in character de c id ed to sh o ot the ent i re family himself with a ri f le and then f en d ( fight ) off the mo n s ter s .
A t that ( very ) moment , he a v i ly ar m ed so l d i er s ar ri v ed and at ta c k ed the mo n s ter s with mi s s il es and k il led them all .
I could only im a g in e the feel ing s of ma in character . If he ' d ( he had ) wait ed a little long er , his who le family might have been sp ar ed .
I enjoy ed the mo v i e a l ot .
The we a ther was n ic e and w ar m to day .
I felt a w ar m b re e z e while I was wait ing for a train on a p l at f or m .
I close d my eyes and tri ed to feel it as much as I could with my who le body .
P er ha p s , my mo o d depend s on the we a ther .
I ' m please d when it ' s s un n y , but not when it ' s bad .
I ha te g l o o m y days .
I feel like I do n ' t want to do anything all day long .
So open ing the w in d ow and c he c k ing the we a ther is the first a ction I do when I w a ke up .
I ho pe tomorrow will be fine we a ther .
It is ra in y , coming and going .
In the morning , I was ma k ing f o o d and my ar m was b ur n t .
I put my ar m under run n ing water .
It was near ly ter ri ble .
I want my English to be c or re c ted , please help me !
A friend of mi ne of ten as k s me to help him with English a c ad e m ic es s a y s , but I ' m not sure if my English is c or re c t , so I strong ly wish some on e would c or re c t my English .
My friend must hand in the es s a y to his teacher by J u ly 2 0 th . I ' ll write it , but I would also like for you to c or re c t it as well .
We have va ri ous c ul ture s , c ust o m s and so ul s , on our own .
Some time s people in for e i g n co un t ri es do n ' t understand it .
A f e w days a g o , I me t an A m er ic an girl .
T u i g er mean s T i g er W o o d s who is a go l f play er .
When S ant a C la us laugh s , he say s `` ho ho ho ``
T i g er W o o d s has four te en girl f ri en d s .

When I understood it , I could n ' t laugh at .
But when she said it to an A m er ic an bo y , he laugh ed at .
M o b i le P h on e
One month a g o , I b ough t a mo b i le p h on e .

P le a se help me le ar n the English language .
I do n ' t like the co l d .
But , when it s n ow s , it make s me ha p p y .
I ' m living alone now .
However , I am we a k at c ook ing .
B e c a us e I make more than need ed .
In this case , I ' m over e at ing .
They also said `` the con ta m in at ed ta p water is not ha z ar d ous for your he al th im m ed i ate ly . ``
Then if I keep dr in k ing the ta p water for a long time , it will in j ur e my he al th .
It is my first ent ry on this sit e .
I have no time or money to go to an e ng l ish school ,
I ' m look ing for w ar d to co m m un ic at ing with many people .
Y ing , than k s a l ot .
I c a n ' t speak J a p an e se , so I c a n ' t help you .
It ' s so e m b ar r as s ing that my under w e ar is always we t . . . ha ha ha
I mean , there are in h er ent mean ing s in every sp e c if ic fact or , includ ing your dr e a m s , a ccord ing to K or e an s up er st i tion s .
If you go for a dr ive with your girl friend in your dr e a m and the ro ad you dr ive down is beautiful like a full sp e ed high way , it mean s you will get me r ri ed with your girl friend soon .
If you see a beautiful ga r d en , or if you have a beautiful ga r d en in your house , it mean s you are l u c k y .
There is funny , but di r ty things includ ed in your dr e a m .
H a ve you ever de f e c at ed in your dr e a m ?
In your dr e a m , if you saw it or you did it , it mean s that the pro ble m s you have will get so l v ed !
If you had a dr e a m about di r ty things , I mean . . . . `` P o o `` , you had better bu y a l ot ter y ti c ke t !
It was strange ; I pai d it every month on line .
A l th ough I told them so by e m a il , they answered that they had not receiv ed it .
But the me m b er of s ta f f might set the wrong account number for my b an k c ar d for the a ut o m at ic fee .
So I pai d it , but the money went into the wrong account .
I explain ed the sit u ation and what I want ed to do there for five minute s .
I ' m not a to ur is t .
I re g is ter ed for F a ce b ook re c ent ly .
My friend s t aught me how to us e it and I soon not ic ed that it is a be ne f ic i al we b s ite .
M or e o ver , all the f un ction s which we can us e are free !
I want to us e `` face b ook `` effect ive ly , make for e i g n friend s , and im p ro ve my ability of English better .
I ho pe my English s k i ll become s better .
P re p ar ing for my P re s ent ation
I ' m read ing a study b ook - the English G r a m m ar in U se by R a y m on d M ur p h y , but some things are not comp le te ly / quite clear for me yet .
M a y b e the a ction / act i v ity has to be a s ing le , at o m ic a ction for the con t in u ous ten se us age and the difficult y is the consider ation - is an a ction is a s ing le or , act u ally , it is a set of a ction s .
I went to M in a m i ( So u th ) - G y ot o ku st ation to con f ir m how long it would take to go on f o ot from that st ation to the proper t ies in t ro d u c ed by the re al state a g en c y last S at ur day .
A fter going back home , I did n ' t feel well and f e ll as le e p .
I ho pe I can re c o ver tomorrow .
We went to a f a m ous ch ur ch , but I for g ot it s name .
And then I went to the to p of No t re _ D ame with N at s um i .
There was a strong w in d , but a n ic e view : D
A fter that , we went to the to p of the E if f el T ow er .
That ' s just what one would expect of P ar is !
3 0 ( M on ) was a b an k _ ho l i day in the U K .
How f a st the days go by ! !
I ce le b r at ed my 2 0 th b ir th day with my friend s
My K or e an friend made a c a ke for me .
In J a p an , when we turn 2 0 y o , we are all ow ed to dr in k al c o h o l le g ally .
And me n can get mar ri ed without their p ar ent s per mission ( for w ome n it is 1 8 y o )
But we have to be respon s i ble for our s el f es .

So please feel free to con ta c t me .
D ur ing the f est i v al per i o d , f a m ous s ing er s are invite d to the un ive r s ity .
E s pe c i ally on the first day , a very se x y and beautiful woman S ing er ' I V Y ' came
I went to see I V Y perform .
' I V Y ' was very be at i ful and I was sh ock ed by her be a ut y .
D ur ing the f est i v al , there was a K or e an tra d i tion al p u b called `` J U M A K `` in the un ive r s ity c amp us .
We saw many people enjoy ing the game and dr in k the so j u
They looked ha p p y and I also was ha p p y .
I like my un ive r s ity f est i v al .
My father is a kind of str ic t , but he is also g en er ous .
She works at co s m etic comp an y .
She and I are ti g h t like friend s .
He is hand s ome so he is a star ( p op ul ar ) in his school .
We like to watch T V to g e ther es pe c i ally dr a m as .
I pai d for the me al s for my friend when I did n ' t have money to pay for it .
This is because I am p l an n ing to bu y c l o th es in the next f e w days .
I was going to pay for her me al but I did n ' t .
I apologize d to my friend but she seemed to ha te to pay for it .
I ne g ot i at ed with my friend who will pay for the me al s next time .
I have to be a good mo d el for her .

My F ri en d .
So - You ng is one of my be st friend s .
I was kind of wait ing for her to call me back but we end ed up not meeting yesterday .
We usual ly call each other very of ten , sh ar ing all the small de ta il s of our live s .
S er i ous ly , I know it is nothing and I am probab ly going to for g e t it like tomorrow morning , but writing this po st is ma k ing me think more hard about this .
I wonder if there are any ex er c is es to im p ro ve my bad po s ture .
M c d on al d ' s started s el ling the M i a m i B ur g er to day .
I ' ve never had this b ur g er before .
I think it ' s ta s ty ? ( It see m s ta s ty )
C o ul d you tell me how it ta st es if you know ?
It ' s a good thing to le ar n a new language from a pro f es s ion al teacher .
I pai d 3 0 do ll ar s to an English teacher yesterday .
I had an English less on for about 3 hour s .
I le ar n ed a l ot of things which are im p or t ant for talk ing to for e i g n er s .
It was f un to le ar n English when she t aught me .
She ga ve me some ti p s so I can us e the sen t ence s that she ga ve me .
I prefer to le ar n English at home but I not ic ed that some time s I should le ar n English by an English teacher .
I am very we a k in the English language .
I can write English very well .
, but when I try to speak , I do n ' t get any w or d s .
A r d ent l o ve was ex po s ed between M as a m i N a g as a w a and A k ir a , a me m b er of E x i le
M as a m i N a g as a w a is a J a p an e se act re s s .
A k ir a is a me m b er of E x i le , which is J a p an e se p op m us ic gr o up .
They are ch il d h o o d friend s and A k ir a is four year s old er than M as a m i .
They ( have de ve l op ed into the l o ve re l ation s h i p ) f e ll in l o ve while con s ul ting their ent er tain ment act i v it ies with each other .
A m at er as u is one of the J a p an e se go d s .
If you would like to know J a p an e se c ul ture , I think O k a m i would be a very good te x t b ook .
O f course , I have the original J a p an e se ver s ion .
I st ud i ed the pro n un c i ation of `` s i `` and `` sh i `` on Y O U T U B E yesterday .
It ' s difficult for the J a p an e se
because they only le ar n the pro n un c i ation of `` sh i `` .
But it is interest ing
So I c a n ' t stop study ing English .
everything is possible E ver y th ing is possible .
I ho pe to make f re n d s with you !
And I will help you im p ro ve your C h in e se s k i ll s , too .
It was my th ir d time and quite interest ing . : ) And what I not ic ed in the class is that there are many A m er ic an s who ten d to dr ive a g re s s ive ly .
It ' s go n n a be ri d ic ul ous ly ex p en s ive .
And I also not ic ed that it is f re a k ing trick y to be care ful about the w or d s I us e that are s ing ul ar or p l ur al in con ver s ation . . .
S or ry to say , I also do n ' t .
F or e i g n people of ten say , `` I ' m pro ud of you . `` I think they are f ant a st ic w or d s , while we hard ly say it here in J a p an .
When I am prais ed by some on e , I feel so ha p p y and become en er g etic .
Besides , I will like him or her so much more ! !
To day is a n ation al ho l i day - the C ul ture D a y .
O ver l un ch / O ver dinner / While eat ing , I watch ed a b a se b a ll game , the J a p an S er ies , on T V .
L u c k i ly for him , d ur ing the ce re m on y , no body th re w a sh o e at him .
I ' ve got bra n d - new g la s se s !
A c t u ally , I could n ' t f i g ur e out how to write a j o ur n al and was a b it trouble d .
D o c t or told me my eyes got better , a little b it .
My g la s se s are bra n d - new and everything is sp ar k ling clear !
I at ta ch ed a p h ot o I took as I was sit ting on my co u ch this after no on .
I took this without the f l ash , because I need ed to c a p ture the b l u e ness ! !
I talk to my p ar ent s on S k y pe every s un day night .
S k y pe is very us e ful l , because we can see face s of each other .
F a ce T im e on i P h on e 4 , too .
We talk about da i ly happen ing s : what I at e , thought , felt
and e t c .
It is a re l i e ve to he ar them .
This is a very ha p p y time for me .
J ust in front of the school ga te , there was a t ent s el ling l o c al gra pe s .
They ta st ed f ant a st ic !
G r a pe s are pro no un c ed `` P o d o `` in K or e an .
What do you call one small b a ll , not a bu n ch of gra pe s ? ( A gra pe . )
They were very ha p p y and laugh ed heart i ly as they saw our pass ion for gra pe s .
G r a pe s are good f o o d , un like ha m b ur g er s .
He l p me .
This year I read the b ook s `` J ust ic e by S and el `` and `` The I d ent ity of D e f l ation `` .
The se b ook s were great , because they express ed pro f ound opinion s .
But the b ook `` T h ing s that I should do at 2 0 ' s age `` express ed sha ll ow opinion s .
W ri ting again
It has been more than one year since I w ro te my last j o ur n al .
In this year I change d job s t w ic e , now I ' m work ing at a comp an y just like the one I left one year before . I feel like I have walk ed in a c ir c le . It ' s too de p re s s ing . . .
English in st r u c t or m ur d er case
R e c ent ly in J a p an a p op ul ar to p ic is who you g man k il led e ng l ish teacher three year s a g o .
He went into hi d ing , yet he being cha s ed by the & n b s p ; police .
The v ic t im was a you ng woman from E ng l and .
He r family came to J a p an , and appeal ed for the k i ll er to be c aught .
I ho pe k i ll er is c aught very very soon .
I think many J a p an e se are friend ly and kind .
But there are bad me n in all country .
So every on e who visit s J a p an , please be care ful . & n b s p ;
If you are care ful , you will enjoy your s el f in J a p an .
We will we l c ome your visit and help you d ur ing your tri p .
As you know , the other day a ma j or e ar th qu a ke hi t J a p an s ever e ly , es pe c i ally the Ka n t o are a , and a l ot people there are f a c ing many difficult ies .
F or ex amp le , a ccord ing to re p or t s , they s u f f er from f o o d short age s and c a n ' t get enough sleep .
B e c a us e I live in the Ka n se i are a , my family and I are ( natural ly ) all right .
He re in the Ka n s a i are a , we le ad the same life as before .
I get up in the morning after I get ting enough sleep , and have b re a k f a st .
And after usual the b re a k f a st , my father go to the office and work for his family as usual .
To be honest , the e ar th qu a ke has little D I R E C T in f l u ence on our da i ly live s . ( O f course , it has many in d i re c t in f l u ence s on us .
This is show n by the fact that I ' m very very w or ri ed about people in Ka n t o , part ly because many of my friend s live there . )
To tell you the tru th , when I watch the de v a st at ing scene on T V , I still c a n ' t be l ive such a c at a st ro p he re ally happen ed in J a p an .
A n y way , I ho pe the sit u ation will be all right and people can get smile s back on their face s as soon as possible .
But I ' m s u f f er ing a kind of set b a c k .
A l th ough I can read things in English to some ex t ent , for ex amp le a new s paper such as C N N , B B C , The N e w Y or k T im es and so on , I c a n ' t speak English well . . . ( In fact , I ' m also poor at writing in English .
But I ' m w or se at speak ing . )
I think one of the reason s why I c a n ' t speak English is that I do n ' t have many op po t un it ies to talk with no n - j a p an e se people in English .
But at the same time , I also think I man age to b r us h up my speak ing ability to some ex t ent by read ing b ook s or listen ing to many ma ter i al s in English .
So now a day s I ' m read ing a l ot of new s p a p er s and b ook s and watch ing v id e o s or mo v ies in English and think ing how I can get a ch ance to express myself in English .
O f course , one of the way s is here ; L an g - 8 !
And in addition , if I can get a ch ance to talk with no n - J a p an e se people in English , it could n ' t be better ! ! !
But the pro ble m is how can I get the ch ance .
Then I came a cross the idea that S k y pe is one of the way s .
P u b l ic B a th
P u b l ic bath s are well know n by J a p an e se .
F or for e i g n er s , it is not as p op ul ar , right ?
( A re there public bath s in other co un t ri es ?
I ' ve see n it only in T ur ke y .
It s called `` H a m a m `` . )
You ng people do n ' t us e public bath s of ten , I think .
But we were the only you ng w ome n .
A fter tak ing a bath ,
We went to an `` I z a k a y a `` to have a be er .
It was so de l ic i ous !
( How do you say `` I z a k a y a `` in English . . . ?
I re ally l o ve F ri day s .
I live in Tokyo .
My b ir th day is on No ve m b er 2 3 r d .
I ` m a un ive r s ity st ud ent .
I study de s i g n .
My ho b b y is listen ing to m us ic and play ing b as s g u it ar .
I j o in ed the r ock m us ic c l u b in sen i or high school .
My favor ite ho b b y is draw ing picture s .
I made not e b ook s of picture s in j un i or high school .
But I will work at my part - time job .
I like fine days ( like this ) .
My ho b b y is c y c ling .
I was sat is f i ed with it , but it was too ex p en s ive for me , about 1 0 0 0 0 yen !
I went to T a m a ri ver to see the f i re w or k s to day .
I could n ' t see the f i re w or k s last year because I c aught the f l u .
So , I ' m ha p p y to be able to see the f i re w or k s this s um m er !
In fact , I feel I am lack ing co m m on sen se for anything .
F or ex amp le , I know the p h r a se `` L e h man sh ock `` , but I do n ' t understand how it effect ed the W or l d E c on o m y and c a n ' t explain it well .
No w I am not a st ud ent any long er , so I think I need to have know led g e about the se things .
There f or e , I b or r ow ed a b ook called `` To the people who became work ing people without understand ing e c on o m y `` written by A k ir a I ke g a m i at l i b r ar y .
I ho pe it help s me ga in more know led g e to understand the e c on o m y .
I re ally dis like read ing b ook s , but I try to do it little by little .
O f course , I have to study the sub j e c t s con ne c ted with comp an y life like honor if ic w or d s , so I need to have more time to study !
I watch an A m er ic an come d y dr a m a called / ti t led `` F ri en d s ``
I watch it when ever I have free time like after work and / or on ho l i day s .
F ri en d s is very funny , so I feel c al m when ever I watch it .
