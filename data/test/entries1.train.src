I talk ed about my me m or ies about the sp or t s day , my dr e a m and
However , we have to go to school by the time we know the re s ul t of the ex a m ,
To day I ' ve got en ro ll ed to this we b s ite .
I ' d like to be better at English but it ' s difficult for me to make sen t ence s in English because of it s co ll o c ation .
So I ' m ha p p y if you c or re c t my di ar y .
If you ' re try ing to le ar n J a p an e se , then I ' ll c or re c t your one .
My girl friend and I are con te m p la ting mar ri age .
We p l an to re g is ter our mar ri age on A p ri l 1 st , A p ri l F o o l ' s D a y , because the day is very re m in d ful .
As they heart ly con g r at ul at ed us he ar ing our new s , I was very re l i e v ed .
It ' s co l d to day too . . .
But I do n ' t think so too .
If you have n ' t ever been to here , please come here for s um m er sea s on : ) ha ha
F ro m to day , I start to write di ar y in English .
B y writing di ar y in English , I a im to make my English s k i ll s better and to become be able to make co m m un ic ation with a b ro ad people .
B y ma k ing the da i ly even t s into te x t , I also a im e to re v i e w each day and make next day better .
I will try it every night .
The first t ar g e t is to con t in u e to write di ar y in one month .
yesterday I went to c a i ro to play ch es s ma t ch and I w on
but the we a ther was very co l d and ra in
The after no on I finish ed the T E C - 6 at last .
I felt a b ur d en had l if t from my should er s .
No w I can conc ent r ate my at ten tion on the f in al ex ame n ation s and es s a y s .
O f cause , I ho pe I could pass it .
To m or r ow is my b ir th day , I c a n ' t wait e to know what s up ri se my class m ate s may give me .
I believe that tomorrow will be an un f or g e t able day because of the l o ve ly friend s .
I like f ly ing in the s k y .
I ' ve le ar n t how to f ly an a ir c r a f t .
This picture is when I le ar n f ly ing .
Even do you like f ly ing in the s k y ?
How to f a ll as le e p soon
If you start to ex er c is e and re ally ti re out your body , you will be n ic e and ex ha ust ed when it come s time to go to be d .
When I began run n ing ex pe c i ally long er dis t ance s ( it took me a w h i le to bu il d up to that , though ) , I would go to be d and we l c ome the sweet re le a se of sleep .
In or d er to run , I began w a k ing e ar ly , us ing this ti p s in the ar t ic le you read .
They work ed , and the f l i p side of the e qu ation is that I became so tired at night that after a w h i le , I just could not stay up l ate any more .
If you begin w a k ing up e ar ly , you might be tired for a f e w days , and even t u ally you will be for c ed either to go to sleep e ar l i er or w a ke up la ter .
It ' s easy - - - - I ' ve done it a l ot .
But if you turn those things off and go to be d , and read in be d , you will probab ly f a ll as le e p , if you ' re re ally tired , from those two ti p s I ga ve a b o ve .
E x er c is e and w a ke up e ar ly , and then go to be d and read .
My P C had been b ro k en .
I sen t it to s er v ic e c ent er .
Yes , I am w ri t ting this di ar y with a bra n d new P C !
I made s ous e in ho r se ma c k er el .
H or se ma c k er el was very c he a p .
It co st me only 1 0 0 yen with 1 8 ho r se ma c k er el !
It was de l ic i ous J a p an e se dinner : )
I felt a little home s ic k for my mother ' s me al ; (
R e c ent ly I always c ook for one s el f .
I will have a dinner with my friend s from or ch est r a .
I am look ing for w ar d it , but little b it s c ar e of it .
He a p p ro a ch ed us on to day ' s part y .
To do a present ation is an im p or t ant s k i ll , is n ' t it ?
I live in S a it a m a where is next to Tokyo .
It take s 3 0 mi n it us from here to Tokyo .
I began to re g is ter this sit e to study language , my friend re c o m m en ed
me j o in it because some on e c he c k it out my j o ur n al s and I can me e t another country friend s though this sit e .
It would be great , if I can make many friend s and know another co un r ty c ul ture .
A fter 3 - week - stay in my re l at ive ' s home , I went to my gr and m o ther ' s home in L ish u i with my family to ce le b r ate C h in e se N e w Y e ar to g e ther .
Then I came back to J in h u a and visit other re l at ive ' s house s , and f in ally I return ed un ive r s ity to p re p ar e for my new se m est er .
I also have six mo d ul es to le ar n in this se m est er , five of which is comp ul s or y and the re m a in one op tion al .
However I have n ' t de c id ed which op tion al mo d ul e I ' m going to take without a b ri e f understand ing .
I was at ten d my g er man course to day , there were just four st ud ent , t re s s t ur k and I , at ten d class because of X - ma s is coming .
My teacher is a am us ing guy , and he asked t ur k to ta u g h us t ur k ish , and asked me to ta u g h them ch in e se .
B T W , they thought that ch in e se is re ally difficult because it is very different from we s ter n language such as l at in or g er man .
A fter the class , I b ough t a bo t t on of l o c al we in ( a kind of S p ar k ling w h ite w in e which l ow al c o h o l ic str e ng th ) in or d er to ce le b r ate x - ma s .
: - ) , This is my first time to ce le b r ate x - ma s in for e i g n country .
I wish I will have a good time .
and me r ry x - ma s to every body !
I wish we all have a good time !

A very interest ing thing is that most me m b er s dr ive the same bra n d c ar of a s er ies of style s ex c ept year .
The c ar ty pe and g en er ation are different .
The an no y ing thing is that T a i pe i always has tra f f ic con g es tion on F ri day s night .

I ' ve see n T r an s f or m er s ' s s er ies and I was also look ing for w ar d to see ing it .
The mo v i e a d op t s in 3 D for m at made by 3 D came r as for the first time .
T h us effect s in 3 D for m at was a w es ome and very natural ly .
B at t le scene s have p ow er ful and I was very ex c it ing .
I thought that the mo v i e show ed the most effect ive in 3 D for m at that I had see n .
I saw the mo v i e of c a p tion ver s ion .
If I per f e c t ly understand con ver s ation s of English on the mo v i e , I would not read c a p tion s .
But I need read c a p tion s ha ha .
3 D for m at made my eyes tired , es pe c i ally read ing c a p tion s .
I wish that I enjoy see ing the mo v i e without J a p an e se c a p tion s .
S ch o o l life in P ar is
it ' s been so good so far .

But any way , I still have a l ot of im p ro ve ment to make in English .
I can de al with normal con ver s ation s but when it come s to business English , it turn s out to be so difficult which I think is the same thing in any language s .
We have C h in e se character s , R o m a j i which is the same thing that English speak ing people us e , Ka ta k an a is most ly us ed to de s c ri b e for e i g n w or d s and H ir a g an a which is a J a p an e se p h on etic language .
I want to le ar n more language s like S p an ish , P or t u gue se e t c .
She a d d ed that this purpose is to pro te c t the he al th of the s m o k er .
And two w ome n in her e ar ly t w ent ies are includ ed .
The s m o k er is about 1 0 % in our office .
And then the `` no - s m o k ing `` became co m m on in our f i el d .
Well , that ' s n ic e and full of s un s h in e and sweet y smile s .
A ll the bu e at i ful things did de p re s s ed me .
In fact , I am c ur r ent ly study the English de p ar t ment in co ll e g e , but I want to have more ch ance s to p r a c t ic e my English .
I have some pro ble m about sp el ling the right w or d s , I usual ly for g e t how to sp e ll or los e some letter s while sp el ling .
A fter I gradua te from co ll e g e , I want to go to F r ance to study M aster d g re e .
However , I just heard about F r ance is ex t re m ly di f f c ul t . . . . .
I ho pe that I can over c ome it .
O h by the way , I got some pro ble m in gra m m ar about the w or d s `` ho pe and if `` .

When ever some on e c l ic k s this a d ver t is e ment s ar t ic le , G o o g le give s me

It see m s that I can get 1 0 0 y en per day ( 3 0 0 0 / M , 36 0 0 0 / Y )
But , I have n ' t enjoy ed that so far .
I was ex t re m e ly bu s y this week because there were a trouble in my job .
It would run over one year in two week s la ter , however the so f t w ar e trouble has found last week .
So I had to work f i x ing bu g s for free even though the so f t w ar e did n ' t make by me .
This is because people who made it qu it our comp an y last month .
O ther w is e if it will o c c ur 2 week s la ter I can e ar n some money .
What a bad ti m ing !
can any body tell me which one of the us age s is c or re c t ? ?

S h in s u ke S h im ad a who is very p op ul ar T V person al ity with d re w from the world of ent er tain ment because it is found out that he had re l ation to J a p an e se ma f i a in the past .
I like him because his talk is very light and very interest ing .
H is talk at t r a c t s people mind s .
I am very s ad think ing that I never see him on T V .
This is first W ri ting English
This is my first w ro te English di ar y , and not good .
But I still want to write , may b e can take good ex pe ri ance .
This is my ho pe in a un ive r s ity so p h o m or e .
To day I want to con t in u e the yesterday ent ry , by writing a little b it about the require ment that I should respect in or d er to ent er the un ive r s ity in D en m ar k .
So , this will be the first big difficult y , because I est im ate that my English le ve l right now is around the B 2 / C 1 e ur o pe an stand ar d le ve l , while I should re a ch in 1 year , in or d er to pass the To e f l with ex ce ll ent s c or es , a C 2 le ve l .
I will finish high school in J un e 2 0 1 3 , but if I want to a p p ly for a D an ish un ive r s ity I need to present my a p p l ic ation by M ar ch 2 0 1 3 , so I do n ' t know if they already require the c er t if ic ation that I w o n ' t have unti l J un e .
I do n ' t want an ent i re year wait ing to ent er the un ive r s ity in 2 0 1 4 , so next year I ' ll try to con ta c t the un ive r s ity to have some i nformation .
But I ' ll have to le ar n D an ish to go to the G ro ce ry st or e or place s like that , I gue s s .
I ' ll se in the future . . . .
I have 1 year still to de c id e on what to do , even t ough I ' m pretty sure about D en m ar k .
I will watch mo v i e .
I will eat at re st r ant in the de p ar t ment st or e .
and I am only in the home .
D o you interest to And ro id ?
And study hard .
And ro id is a l ot of talk in J a p an re c ent ly .
But , A l m o st of the i nformation is e ng l ish .
English is ne ce s s ar y to make the good And ro id a p p l ic ation .
This is a reason that I study English .
In this country there are bu n ch of ra c is t .
I understand some people say some ra c is t commen t s to me because they and I are friend s .
However , still I like here .
I wish I can speak f l u ent ly in English and make friend s with them as A m er ic an people do each other .
Yes ter day and the day before yesterday I work ed a part time job .
I c a n ' t tell the con t ent s of the work , but it was re ally effort less .
In c id ent ally , I en ro ll in te m p or ar y e m p l o y a g en c y .
The work of yesterday and the day before yesterday was that a g en c y ' job .
It ' s an hour ly w age of $ 1 0 .
And I went out for dinner with my be st friend last night .
A fter eat ing , we stop p ed at b ook st or e near the re st a ur ant .
And I en c o un ter ed my high s c o o l ' s friend .
He also is interest ed in study ing a b ro ad , so we talk ed for some time .
I have only a f e w friend s who understand my mind of study ing a b ro ad .
I have a re al i z ation of im p or t ance of my friend s now .

A mo un t of people and a f l o o d of good s are there .
n ic e to me e t you !
I ' m study ing English , es pe c i ally writing and speak ing .
To day ' s my p l an
I ' m going to l un ch and Ka r a o ke with my friend .
But first , I will going to star b a c k s .
I like that going to a co f f e e sh op in the morning .
I read b ook , write a di a ly and s ut d y in English at there .
D o you have your favor ite place ?
F or e i g n er can understand only w or d s .
It is a place that see s Tokyo T ow er there and is very beautiful .
It went to R op po ng i after it had co un ted down .
D o you know C ha ro ?
It is b ro ud c as ting by N H K ra d i o and T V of English course .
There are a small p a th name d `` O m o id e - Y o k o ch o `` in the we s ter n side of S h in j u ku S t ation .
The p a th and b ar s have S h ow a R e t ro S ty le , it look s like it is not change d for long time from S h ow a er a .
It was my first visit to the p a th .
We enjoy ed dr in k ing some be er and other dr in k s and y a k it or is with very reason able p ri ce .
I had watch ed H a k on e E k id en , which is the most f a m ous long - dis t ance ra ce in J a p an , on T V for 2 days from J an u ar y 2 .
I have always watch ed this ra ce without mi s s ing every year since I was an e le ment ar y st ud ent .
I at t r a c t this ra ce .
F ir st , this ra ce has long history .
This ra ce has done every year for 8 5 year s .
That is , this ra ce keep s do ing for 8 5 year s .
This ra ce is done by U n ive r s ity students l o c at ed in Ka n t o re g ion .
F or in st ance , the students has much effort s to part ic i p ate in this ra ce .
Some run n n er give s up without comp e ting by ex t re m er y de h y d r ation and l ow b l o o d s u g ar .
Yes , this ra ce is s ever e ly because almost run n n er s run about 2 0 k m .
E s pe c i ally , this ra ce se p ar ate s 1 0 se ction s between O te machi , Tokyo and H a k on e ( 5 se ction s for one way ) , run n n er s must run 8 5 0 me ter di f f er ence a b o ve sea le ve l on 5 th se ction .
That ' s why no body know s what happen s .
And the reason why I am the most at t r a c t is that the run n n er ' s im po s ing f i g ur es en c o ur age s me to feel more hold out what ever may happen .
I could get a l ot of impress ion and co ur age .
It ' s been a long time to visit here since I w ro te a di ar y about my ex - girl friend ' s w ed d ing .
I just came here for look ing around what ' s new here , not for writing .
but when I read the di ar y a b o u my ex - girl friend , I de c id e to up d ate my di ar y .
be c u a se I f e ll in l o ve with a woman .
I me t her girl 5 month a g o at work .
She was just my co - work er .
I started my job last year but there are l ot s of reason that I ' m think ing of it .
I in ten d ed to go to a gradua te school after gradua ting un ive r s ity .
The comp an y that I ' m work ing for is little b it strange , for ex amp le even we over w or k ed we c a n ' t get pai d . . . .
there are a l ot s .
G ri p ing and comp la in ing do n ' t change sit u ation and any way I need to work before going back to school s aving t u i tion fee .
So I thought that to change a job is one of ch o ic es .
One of my friend s have already take n a job in ter v i e w s and he told me that what he was asked .
There was a question what made him re ally e m b ar r as s ed , that ' s ' ' What is your str e ng th are a ? ? ' '
I think we know what we like or what we interest ed in , but if some on e as k me ' ' what is you str e ng th are a ? ? ' '
I ' m not sure if I can answer soon or not .
I was b ough t up in B us an .
I re ally l o ve to le ar n for e i g n language and I also l o ve tra ve l to me e t around world people .
J u - he e ( in ter v i e w e e ) : I ' m good at con s ul ting with un i qu e people and meeting .
A l s o I have a le ad er s h i p and strong mind .
So , I have de ve l op ed myself through the act i v ity of gr o up in our school I ' ll do be st .
J u - he e ( in ter v i e w e e ) : I think about a f light at ten d ant should be po s it ive , respon s i ble , and a d a p t able in ant sit u ation because they and me e t va ri ous in ter n ation al people in many different sit u ation s .
And , they should treat them e qu ally and sp on ta ne ous ly .
A l s o they should re al i z e their a ction s quick ly and c al m ly and them , try to con t ro l any pro ble m s .
I think pass e ng er s could be re le ive d by this be ha v i or , and pro f es s ion al perform ance .
P le a se sign up here .
I po st the paper s la ter .
I will never for g e t that my da n c ing teacher have asked me a question when I was 1 7 year s old .
I have j o in ed dance c l u b when I was a sen i or st ud ent , but it was very difficult for a new le ar n er , no matter po se s or te m po s , I ' m such as a do r k . . .
My teacher have asked me : `` Why are you come here ?
I do n ' t re p ly any m or e to him , b a c a us e I know that he just re m in d ed me should be serious for da n c ing , do n ' t care view s of some on e .
L e ar n ing da n c ing for 4 year s , ho pe ful ly one day , people will as k me : `` A re you a teacher ?
`` , not `` A re you a dance r ?
`` any m or e .
On ce I have dance d in night c l u b , a teacher who is teaching b a ll ro o m da n c ing , he have asked me : `` Why are you want to le ar n da n c ing ?
B e c ome a teacher in the future ?
I ' ll keep to le ar n da n c ing unti l for ever .
I find that it ' s e as i er to say something I feel e m b ar r as s ed in English than in M and ar in .
The a b o ve is nothing to do with this j o ur n al I am going to say .
The thing I want to say is I think I should stop hi d e my feel ing .
I am a b s o l ut e ly a honest woman ; however , my nature is to hi d e my own feel ing .
A l s o he is very s m ar t and good at ar ch te c ture and history .
I re ally like to go to his class ; however , I always keep s il ent because I am afraid he will c ri t ic i z e about what I say .
And I am going to stay in H s in ch u so that I am afraid that I w o n ' t me e t such an ex ce ll ent teacher .
And then I told him I talk to my p ar ent s every day too but I s el d o m tell them what I did .
3 ) I am straight but I feel more co m f or t able to talk to woman .
And I feel it ' s e as i er for me to make friend s with woman .
I am that kind of person who will p re ten d to be care less when I me e t the guy I like .
To day is my friend s b ir th day .
So I want ed to sen d E - ma il to say H a p p y B ir th day , at just 1 2 : 0 0 .
But I was so tired yesterday that I can t sen d it
I was as s l ept . So very sh ock > <
A fter school , I went to sh op p er , sh op p ing c ent er to study .
I study alone unti l 1 5 : 0 0 , then Ka t t u ch an who is my bo y f ri en d came . He and I st ud i ed to g e ther ti ll 2 2 : 0 0 . We were talk ing a little . I was ha p p y .
But , I m tired . . . > <
S p an k or not to sp an k ?
We can speak to them and tea ch what is wrong and what is right and in the long ter m that will be more effect ive than hi t t ng .
I to t ally agree with it .
And that ' s what a good so c i e ty is , which can e m b r a ce mi n or ity .
I agree with it .
T ro u ble is k in k of tra n d m ar k of ch il d re n .
C h il d re n is not ch il d re n any m or e if they know how to be ha ve and never make mistake s , I think .
It ' s natural p ar ent s face all kind s of trouble when ra is ing their ch il d re n so it ' s n ic e if p ar ent s can understand and enjoy the trouble that ch il d re n make .
What D o You T h in k A bout L e ar n ing O ther L an g u age s ?
D o you think m aster ing other language s re l ate to le ar n er s ' age ?
I ' m sure that people can m aster other language s without re la ting their age .
However , it take s a little b it long time to m aster other language s , comp ar ed to you ng people .
I think that the most im p or t ant thing to m aster other language s is to ma in tain mo t i v ation with high le ve l .
B e c a us e we c a n ' t hand le other language like n at ive speak er s quick ly .
However , it is very va l u able for us to take our who le life to m aster other language s .
I ' ve re m e m b er ed that how my d aught er had le ar n ed J a p an e se .
When she was a b a b y , I always tri ed to speak her with simple J a p an e se p h r as es , and she had watch ed J a p an e se T V show s for kid s every day .
I also read her a bu n ch of b ook s in J a p an e se .
That mean s she had gr ow n up with J a p an e se language circumstance s .
There f or e , If I could do as if b a b ies le ar n ed their mother to n gue s , I would be able to m aster English .
I ' ve heard about that hu man being s us e only 1 0 per c ent of bra in s .
We do n ' t us e n in e ty per c ent what is left of our bra in s .
I think it is re ally was te not to us e who le of bra in s .
I ' m sure that we can have ex t r a room to re m e m b er other language into our bra in s .
I want to believe that I can m aster English from now on , if I would n ' t ch o se wrong way to le ar n English .
I would l o ve to ma in tain high ly mo t i v ation ; I also want to put myself into circumstance s where I must us e English .
I have to go to un ive r c ity now .
good b y e .
So I ' ve not go to s n ow b o ar d ing y e t .
I wonder if I going to go to s n ow b o ar d ing next week .
I s A m er ic an e ng l ish pro n un c i ation di f f ir ent from B ri t ish English one ?
I do n ' t know we a ther English speak er s know there are 4 kind s of English pro n un c i ation s in to e ic t est .
C er tain ly I can b ar e ly per ce ive those di f f er ence s , ut for me it ' s tri f ling .
A t the same time , I wonder how n at ive speak er s feel and consider those di f f er ence s .
I some time s he ar B ri t ish is pro ud of their O R I G I N A L E N G L I S H P R O N U N C I A T I O N , and some English claim A m er ic an English pro n un c i ation is N O T for m al .
B y the way , I have been st ud ing A m er ic an English ( I mean , I us e C N N in sp ite of B B C as le an ing ma ter i al s and so for th ) So I am us ed to he ar A m er ic an English .
I of ten feel they both are the same .
I found this mo v i e tra il er out on A p p le tra il er s sit e .
`` The S c i ent is t `` is interest ing to me as long as I saw it s tra il er .
W o man : So , What do you think happen s you di e ?
M an : That is that you bu y ?
I felt a little b it co l d at first but became w ar m after play ing .
One of my co ll e a gue over 5 0 age are very t ough because he usual ly play s ten n is after work .
I am comp le te ly los e him at s ta m in a .
I felt that it is im p or t ant to ex er c is e re g ul ar ly .
When I read your e m a il , I da ted my mo m only in night .
She w or e pretty that night .
We went to have J a p an e se b b q f o o d in C a us e way B a y .
A th ough we always have dinner with her , but I am first time to invite her in for m al .
This is very sp e c i al for us .
Let me to sha re some p h ot o s to you .
We tea ch each other to be hu m ble .
We have to be hu m ble , even if you are told to be so , when we re c o g n i z e a fact that we have bad point , and little p ow er .
L on g time no see .
I ' m a st ud ent at un ive r s ity of R it s um e i k an in J a p an .
I ' ve st ud i ed English for since j un i or high school st ud ent .
The reason why I le ar n English is to go to study a b ro ad .
I ' m ma j or ed R o b ot ic s e ng in e er ing , so I want to study about ro b ot ic s and sha re with those who study ing ro b ot ic s all over the world about my i nformation and and know led g e and idea and so on .
so I ' m try ing to ex pe ri ence on English as possible every day as I can .
My ho b b y is watch ing mo v ies kind of a ction and s c i ence f i ction .
My favor ite mo v i e is B a c k to the future .
I also like listen ing m us ic .
I ' m l o v ing B o A and T a y l or S w if t .
One more , I ' m interest ed in tra ve ling .
E ver y time I visit other country , I can find a l ot of c ul ture , people , different from my country .
E ver y th ing is fresh .
If you find any mistake s in my J o ur n al .
P le a se c or re c t me .
It was e ar th qu a ke .
It is said that a big e ar th qu a ke is g en er at ed in the near future in Y o k o ha m a .
I went to a b as ke t b a ll get - to g e ther .
but I was just look ing as usual .
I want ed to get better A S A P .
To do so , I have to work hard er on do ing a re he b .
To day , I at e a dis h of tak o - y a k i .
T a k o is o c t op us in English , tak o - y a k i is a piece of o c t op us co at ed with f l o ur and gr il led round ly .
I l o ve sea f o o d , particular ly l o ve sh ri m p and o c t op us .
So , I ' d like to try to eat a va ri e ty of sea f o o d dis he s all over the world .
My friend , M in came from T ha i 3 year s a g o .
She and I have been made a friend s this A p r at the c ook ing school .
Some time s she tea ch es me T ha i , but I would see the w or d s look like all same .
But I know that language has a r ul e to us e .
I m po s s i ble is nothing
In next week , a present ation s ch ed ul e has been f i x ed .
I will make a present ation for my new c l i ent in English .
It will be first time that I make it for `` new c l i ent `` .
I should make a care ful p re p ar ation for the coming day .
I ' m very n er v ous , and c ur i ous .
When I ar r ive in K y ot o , I saw a l ot of mo d er n bu il d ing s .
I thought `` Where are old temple s ? ? ? ``
`` This c ity is not so different from my town . . . ``
But walk ing around the c ity , I found there are many temple s and sh ri ne s there .
I thought I want ed to live there , and I could take a l ot of p ic s .
To day I l o g ed in to c he c k if I have got any me s s age .
L at er I help t two f ri en s to c or re c t their C h in e se writing .
I ho pe we all can take part ic i p ation in this act i v ity and sha re ha p p i ness or so r r ow with other s .
The mo v i e is F a st & F ur i ous 4 .
This f il m did n ' t dis a p po in t me at last .
This morning I s c ar ed of being called to the board for an or al t est , but no teachers did .
yesterday I b ough t a new ce ll p h on e .

I think it ' s just good p r .
why do you l o ve your i p h on e ?
This week was so hard time for me .
I am look ing for w ar d going it .
I want to in t ro d u ce myself but do n ' t know what to say .
He thought I was mo d est .
But act u ally I am try to be honest .
No w I am read some b ook s about P s y ch o l o g y .

I ho pe that will became s un n y ! !
F ro m H o k k a id o for O k in a w a are bad we ther .

I bra k ed my c ar as hard as I could , and I was narrow ly able to a v o id run n ing him over .
He must have had something wrong with his bra in , probab ly because of old age .
It look n ic e we a ther to day .
To do l is t
* D o ing ex pe ri ment ( cha ng ing the me d i um e )
* M a k ing paper s with p ow er point about di a b e te s es pe c i ally in s ul in effect me ch an is m
I did ' n t time to eat , as I w o ke up l ate .
A n y way I still wonder my e ng l ish will be better .
We went to sh op p ing .
That is so c ut e !
It is small and to get there , we tra ve l 3 0 minute s by boat .
There are many be a ch es , where the people go for a s w im , walk or s ur f .
There are many s ur f er s in the sea be a c us e there are good w a ve s .
It is very re la x ing and al place s are very c le an .
On the co a st have many re st a ur ant with different s y t le s .
You can see f ant a st ic things in this is l and !
I went to friend ' s house get ting on the sub way .
The sub way in N e w Y or k was comp le x .
However , it became a good ex pe ri ence .
A t that time , C an ad a also went by the day tri p .
I ra n about 4 0 0 0 mi le s by c ar .
I want also to visit the U S A .
It p l an s N e w Y or k from L as V e g as .
A J a p an e se guy in L on d on .
T h ough I ' ve been here six month s , I still have question s which is not quite clear to me .
I think it ' s not ex a g g er ation to say J a p an e se s er v ic e business es have high est qu al it ies in the world .
T r a in s and bu s se s in Tokyo hard ly ever a b or t it s s er v ic e on the way .
T r a in s run every 2 minute s follow ing time t able and if train is l ate for more than 5 mi n u ite s , we can get refund .
I have n ' t take n a show er with co l d water because show er s have n ' t b ro k en and if it ' s b ro k en re p a ir man come s and f i x es it on the day .
There are cha in re st a ur ant who se p l ic es of f o o d s are n ' t so different from those of M a c d on al d s .
We can c ance l con t r a c t s of mo b il es through the in ter ne t 2 4 hour s .
We can re s er ve the day we c ance l con t r a c t s of mo b il es .
T h us , all J a p an e se people have to a d a p t themselves to in c on ve n i ence .
P l us , L on d on ' s s er v ic e which is way behind the time s is co m m on sub j e c t for us .
Why L on d on is in c on ve n i ent , though it is in a d v ance d country and is a e c on o m ic c a p it al of the world ?
I found an interest ing we b s ite about some co m m on writing mistake s of English gra m m ar that n at ive speak er s make f re qu ent ly .
It ' s o b v i ous that those w or d s are very close in both pro n un c i ation and mean ing to each other and that this make s it hard for n at ive speak er s to tell them a p ar t when it come s to writing .
If anything , co m m on mistake s J a p an e se people would make would be about ar t ic le s , co un t able no un s , and ten se .
I receiv ed my office t est with co - work er s to day .
It is im p or t ant for me , the t est is for my pro m o tion in the office .
The pass ing line is 6 0 point s .
I ' m so tired d u e to the t est , and go to be d !
How was your to day ?
To me , I ' m not good .
B e c a us e there are many people who speak English very well in my English a c ad e m y .
F re e c l u b is free of charge class for students .
In to day ' s free c l u b , we dis c us s ed about H on d ur as ' s pro ble m .
we made gr o up s of 4 g u y s each gr o up , and talk about it .
But me and a girl hard ly never speak ing .
A fter that time , I have a di f f id ence .
As if my big con f id ence become ti n y be an .
C an you give me a consolation ?
S h i z u o k a is p op ul ar with M o un t F u j i ( F u j is an ) and G re en tea .
I us ed to look out it d ur ing a b or ing class .
G re en tea is the one of the f a m ous J a p an e se D r in k in the world , I think .
S h i z u o k a is the high est p re f e c ture of con s um p tion of gr e en tea in j a p an .
We , S h i z u o k a people , dr in k gr e en tea every after l un ch .
U n f or t un ate ly , S h i z u o k a is not one for sight se e ing like K y ot o or Tokyo .
However it ' s the one of the be st place to live in J a p an .
We can get to Tokyo or N a g o y a with in an hour by express train ( S h in k an s en ) .
A l m o st all P e op le are kind .
I ' ve started T w it ter .
I ' m not sure about how to play it yet very much .
A l s o on T w it ter , I ' ll t w e e t only in English to im p ro ve a language s k i ll .
D o es any on e re g is ter it ?
I year n after them , because they have b ro n d ha ir , and b l u e or b r ow n eyes , and high no se s , and they are very good style .
I think they are very n ic e sen se .
I want to be good at speak English , because I talk with them and become friend ly with them .
However , I can not study to talk or he ar .
Where should go to me e t with them here ?
It see m s 2 day s are w ar m and fine .
This im age is as you see r ough draw ing .
I c a n ' t re m e m b er it is the one us ed which work ing .
A n im at or draw not only the person , but also s m o ke and other natural p h en ome n on .
A l m o st an im at or do n ' t like draw natural p h en ome n on .
there is a person who like draw natural p h en ome n on .
They are called `` effect an im at or `` in J a p an .
The b ri d e is so beautiful and I wish I would be n ic e like this one day .
Well , just ho pe .
There is the p ar k between the near est st ation and the ho s p it al he is in .
It was ra in ing he a v i ly , and I was l is ting to m us ic in full v o l um e .
While I was walk ing through the p ar k , some h ow my wall e t f e ll off from my pocket .
When I re al i z ed , I was in a co l d s w e at .
There were some c ash c ar d s , credit c ar d s , my dr ive r l ic ence , and other stuff in my wall e t !
But my wall e t was take n to the police bo x by a kind gentle m en !
Some h ow the police office r knew it .
In or d er to p r a c t ic e English , I think I should better us ing both English and J a p an e se in my b l o g .
A l th ough I do not think that there will be many people visit ing my b l o g .
I have sp ent all my will of language le ar n ing J a p an e se .
But , now I am the four th gra d e in co ll e g e , I want to find some work after I gradua te .
C o m p ar ing English and J a p an e se , I like J a p an e se better than English .
O k a y , I am going to listen ing English dr a m a first , start ing from `` F ri s n d s `` .
But I don ` t wait ing only .
I always try to make a a ction of str i ke it ri ch in my life .
This is my first writing
I went to B a th in the U K last week en d .
B a th see m s to be us ed as the ro ot of `` bath `` .
A c t u ally , there is an old hot sp r ing bath made by an c i ent R o man in B a th .
I want ed to take the old bath , but it was not possible because it is to be pro te c ted as a her it age .
There were C h ri st m as mar ke t also in B a th .
C h ri st m as mar ke t see m s to be a c ul ture from E ur o pe an con t in ent .
There were many small sh op s in open sp a ce near big ch ur ch .
I at e Y o s en a b e , and I am full and sleep y .
F ir st , the change of the at t it ud es to the C on st it u tion all ow ed D o u g la s s to take part in po l it ic s .
G ar ri s on i an s took no n v ot ing po l ic y because they thought po l it ic s in the United States was already c or r up t and to part ic i p ate in it de g r ad ed themselves .
The C on st it u tion is a b as is of po l it ic s in this country ; there f or e there was no way for D o u g la s s to get in v o l v ed in it as long as he de n i ed the C on st it u tion .
A l th ough his speech es and writing s which he made d ur ing G ar ri s on i an days impress ed a l ot of people , it did not give any p r a g m at ic p ow er for D o u g la s s to a b o l ish s la ver y .
On the other hand , in po l it ic s , once you could appeal to a number s of v o ter s , you could act u ally change the so c i e ty through e le ction s and re al i z ing po l ic ies in the C on g re s s .
The town is very small , but is know n for it s tra d i tion al c ity s c a pe , where I could see beautiful ant i qu e ga s s l amp s stand ing along stone street s and some bu il d ing s , which has been bu il t about 1 0 0 year s before .
What ' s more , I could feel the great nature because the town was being s ur r ound ed by mo un tain s , which were begin n ing to turn re d and y e ll ow .
There , I b ough t a gr il led s qu id , some f ri ed ch ic k en s and p ot at o s , a st ic k of b an an a with the ch o c o l ate , two can d y a p p le s and a can d y gra pe , four T a i y a k is and an O k on o m i y a k i .
It was good to watch some tra d i tion al dance s , which was play ed by students of the school of the town , with the se f o o d s .
I enjoy ed so much of f o o d s and the nature , and the f est i v it i y of the small town .
yesterday ' s di ar y
yesterday I read ed an ar t ic le from comp an y ma il .
I find that it ' s easy to read the ar t ic le but I c a n ' t write it .
I some days do n ' t l o g in L an g - 8 .
I like to read pe a p le write ar t ic le .
I like English , I like j a p an e se .
but I per f er the ch in e se .
No w a days , We can ex change f i re w or k s with some it e m s at street s ta ll s .
My friend s get them and us e f i re w or k s .
B y the way , you know we have F u ku s h im a pro ble m in J a p an .
That pro ble m is very big and con t in u ed , so there is an s el f - con t ro l at m o s p he re now .
M an y f i re w or k s f est i v al s are c ance led this year .
If gr il led ch ic k en s s m e ll good , what may I say ?
The ch ic k en is s a v or y or f r a g r ant ?
To day , we have an English class .
M is s G an sen t us a ta st paper about translation .
But we did bad ly .
F ir st ly , our v o c a b ul ar y is poor .
We can not us e the ex a c t w or d s to express our s el ve s . what ' s more , most of th e gra m m er we le ar n t in high school have been for g e t ten .
So our English become more and more poor .
I can only us e the simple w or d s .
That ' s too ter ri ble
I writing but I talk is my pro ble m , my friend s are j a p an e se , have a great ch ri st m as . j a v i
To day , In the morning I went to work and then in the even ing I went to dr in k ing with my friend .
It ' s been a long while since I dr un k , so soon I got a dr un k .
I ' m like ly f a ll as le e p .
To m or r ow I have to work from 1 0 to 2 3 , so I ' ll go to be d now .
It has been a long time since last time I visit ed this we b s ite .
I ho pe that I can im p ro ve my e ng l ish writing s k i ll by keep ing a j o ur n al here .
I be l on g to U n b al ance which is one of the c l u b in my co ll e g e .
It is a c l u b to play many sp or t s such as v o ll e y b a ll , bad m in t on , f ut s al , b as ke t b a ll and so on .
The c l u b act on F ri day once a week .
We made some tea m s and each of the tea m s f ough t .
As a re s ul t my tea m los t , but we can enjoy ed the game .
T h ough many people say U n b al ance is funny name , I like this c l u b !
And this we b s ite have asked me if I made it or not every day .
I just want to write something .
But I think that for g ing the ha b it is more im p or t ant than writing long stuff some time s .
( This is N O T my ex c us e for my not po st ing for the past about ten days . . . ) I thought I would write some sen t ence s like I ' ve been do ing but I not ic ed that I ' d already written enough .
O K , I make it a r ul e to write something down every day for re al ! !
To be con t in u ed to tomorrow ! !
L an g - 8 made me a l ot of friend s
I have a l o f of friend from L an g - 8 .
Some of them I us ed to talk ed on s k i pe and M S N with them I was re ally ha p p y to do re l ation with them .
A ll of my friend s re ally n ic e and kind .
They are tea ch me in English when I have a question and do n ' t understand something s .
They made me have p ow er to study English w he a ther and ch er me all the time I f e ll w ar m . I will read a b ook and co m b a c k to us e my comp ut er again .
The D is a g re e ment of U s ing A ut o m o b i le 1 . P le a se c or re c t . T h an k you ! !
A l th ough there are some opinion s that a ut o m o b il es have many pro f it s , I think that they ri se more the ne g at ive im p a c t they have had on to va ri ous things than be ne f it ical im p a c t .
There are two reason s : w or s ing the en v ir on ment and de c re as ing a ch ance of co m m un ic ation .
The first reason is to w or se the e m v ir on ment by ex ha st ga s se s .
The ex ha ust ga s se s from a ut o m o b il es give the e m v ir on ment some ne g at ive im p a c t s .
C ar b on di o x id e ga s and N O x ga s which is a gr o up of n it ro g en e ous o x id e are some of the it s ga s se s .
In addition , it also made va ri ous living things ex t in c t and still are for c ing some an im al s and in se c t s to va n ish .
F or ex amp le , one of the O g as a w ar a but ter f l ies which only live in O g as a w ar a is l and s in J a p an di ed out by c l im ate change .
The second reason is to de c re a se an op po t un ity of co m m un ic ation .
The un e x pe c ted meeting may give wonder ful time to you and make your tra ve ll ing more f un .
So you had better not us e a ut o m o b i le but take a train , bu s , and other public f a c il it ies for tra ve l .
M an y people enjoy us ing a ut o m o b il es for sh op p ing , tra ve ll ing , of c ous e , dr i v ing .
But I think it is um p ro f it for us to con t in u e us ing them .
R e c ent ly , it is the ra in y sea s on in J a p an .
I ho pe it will be n ic e we a ther as soon as possible .
To day is the S a p po ro on B us i ness
H as a very co l d s n ow ing
The F o o d is de l ic i ous
A t this time , I was in ch in a for my business tri p .
The a d re n al in and the feel ing of you are in the middle of the f i el d , fight ing for your life - even in a s im ul ation b at t le - give s you a new le ve l of con f id ence and p ow er !
Yes , I know , P ant er a was a da m n good b and and if you understood this re f er ence I must tell you have a great m us ical ta s te !
But , back ing to the point , I play P a in t b a ll for p ur e pleasure .
I j o in ed a gr o up of friend s which all S un day play s to g e ther in or d er to `` k i ll `` and `` be k il led `` by a pai n t b a ll sh o ot ed by a co ll e a gue just to over e x ten d their week ly p re s s ur e .
So , in the end , every body go home , ha p p y and with a smile on their face .
It ' s a quite different of the stand ar d P a in t b a ll in most part to it s r ul es and mi l it ar y character is t ic s like t at ic s , str ate g ies , mission s and mo ve s .
If I should re c o m m en d a for e i g n visit or who has only one day to sp en d in my country .
F or the follow ing two reason s , I think he or she should go to A k i ha b ar a .
One is that we can bu y a l ot of new and ra re e le c t r ical a p p l i ance s .
There are more than 5 0 e le c t r ical a p p l i ance sh op s which display and se ll va ri ous it e m s quick ly at A k i ha b ar a .
F or ex amp le , I went to A k i ha b ar a last S un day in or d er to bu y an e le c t ri c c or d .
I had a p l an to bu y it first .
But when I looked around some sh op s , I want ed to bu y some other new and ra re it e m s such as i P h on e 4 which went on s al e last month s , some re d light s which is us ed in police c ar s , and the D V D s of f a m ous an im ation with do ll s .
As a re s ul t L b ough t them be s id es an e le c t ri c c or d .
The other is that we can see original J a p an e se sub c ul ture such as co m ic b ook s , an im ation s , and game s .
There are a l ot of them A k i ha b ar a because e le c t r ical a p p l i ance sh op s se ll them .
F or in st ance , when I went to bu y a game for P la y S t ation , I could see some person s who w or e the co st um es which the game character s we ar ing .
They are called the co st um e play er s , they we ar them and go to A k i ha b ar a every week en d .
S u ch people can be see n only A k i ha b ar a .
In conc l us ion , I suggest that a for e i g n visit or who has only one day to sp en d in my country go to A k i ha b ar a .
When ever I go there , I enjoy bu y ing some new and ra re it e m s and watch ing the co st um e play er s .
When I ar ri v ed at home ( It was usual ly around 6 : 3 0 p .
m ) , my so n and I took bath right away .
Then , I serve d dis he s as I had p re p ar ed it the day before .
Then , I did the re st of house h o l d ch or es , took care of my so n e t c . . . . . . . . . . .
This week might be as bu s y as I was a s ing le . . . .
A l th ough he is p op ul ar y know n as a s ing er - so ng w ri ter , but I l o ve his g u it ar play .
H is g u it ar sound is sure ly like as his natural voice !
I was so impress ed with his g u it ar play rather than his s ing ing .
And I ' ve got a similar impress ion with B o b M ar le y , the most f a m ous j a m a ic an
B o th great s ing er - so ng w ri ter s play ed the g u it ar like their s up re m e s ing ing .
A m a z on K in d le ar ri v ed .
My A m a z on K in d le ar ri v ed to day morning .
I am quite dis s a po in ted .
It is my first impress ion .
I b ough t it es pe c i ally to read free e - b ook s about e - business .
It has pro ble m with p d f for m at .
When I con ver t p d f f i le to am a z on ' s for m at it does n t ' t look good .
I b ough t 4 - hour week b ook from A m a z on and I am impress ed how quick ly bu ing is .
This is act u ally one c l ic k bu y .
I ho pe I will know better K in d le and I will be more please d about this p ur ch a se .
I am not a b ook l o ver at all .
M a y b e I should have been bu y a t able t in s te ad of e - b ook read er ?
I ' ll try to write a small re v i e w of A m a z on K in d le on my b l o g .
In re c ent days , there are re c or d ing s n ow here .
So , this time , I made up the mo v i e about w h ite scene ry .
And I up l o ad ed on my b l o g .
I want to sen t this mo v i e to people who watch ing my b l o g .
I ' ll try to finish a next mo v i e to night !
N e w ter m is began two week s .
My class m ate s study more and more hard .
I felt so tired now .
But I ' ll more and more hard .
E ver y body , P le a se s up p or t me !
To day , I will talk about my ho b b y .
My ho b b y is tak ing a picture .
And I re ally want to get a s ing le - l en s re f le x came r a .
But I have no came r as .
So I always take picture s by ce ll p h on e .
A s ing le - l en s re f le x came r a has a l ot of f as c in at ing things .
And there are two reason s why I want it .
S e c on d , it is that the im age qu al it ies are better than di g it al came r as p re e m in ent ly .
I want to take picture s about a c r ow b ar f i el d in ra in y day .
I think it become so beautiful picture s because of co l or con t r a st .
I have see n the scene ry once , and it was so wonder ful .
I never for g e t it .
I always take l and s c a pe picture s .
Some time s f l ow er that b l o o m ing in my ga r d en , some time s f al le n le a f that has f al le n on ro ad , and some time s the s k y that not is at all .
A l s o , I do not like picture s with the person so much .
There are W A B I and S A B I in J a p an , and I think J a p an e se do not like l and s c a pe s with the person like me .
A c t u ally , I like one person better than many people .
B e c a us e of need not being ne ce s s ar y to speak for c i b ly the nature is easy .
I b ough t ha ir p in with a f l ow er .
A n y way , tak ing a picture is so f un .
It is because things see m to be different from usual ly a ccord ing to pass ing the l en s .
And it is because of the le ad into the dis c o ver y that it is new .
have a co l d
c a n ' t stop run n y no se .
have a so re th ro at . . .
took some me d ic in e .
With the de ve l op ment of te ch no l o g y , the way of ga in ing i nformation is not re st ri c ted in b ook s any m or e .
V ar i ous kind s of ma s s me d i a are in v ent ed to a c ce l er ate our sp re ad of a c k n ow led g e such as te le v is ion and f il m .
No w I am going to an a ly z e the a d v ant age s and dis ad v ant age s among b ook s , te le v is ion and f il m .
B ook s were consider ed as the only way of ga in ing a c k n ow led g e in old time and only certain gr o up of people like in t el le c t u al and po l it ic i an s could read them .
Even now , b ook s has still play ed a c r u c i al ro le in a c ad e m e .
T a ke for ex amp le , p rofessor s in un ive r s ity us e b ook s as ma in teaching ma ter i al and s c i ent is t s re c or d their find ing s in paper s .
The a c c ur a c y of i nformation from b ook s is un d o u b ted because the p u b l ish ing of a b ook is through serious pro ce s s .
However , read ing b ook s is a pass ive way to receiv e i nformation and there are not so many people have p at i ence to do it .
C o m p ar ed to b ook s , te le v is ion has brought us to an a d ve n ture of enjoy ment of v is ion which open the do or of i nformation sp re ad ing .
A ccord ing to a s ur ve y , people in T a i w an sp en d at least 2 hour s every day on te le v is ion at all age s which re ve al s that the at t r a ction of te le v is ion is ir re s is t i ble .
There is no do u b t that te le v is ion has become part of our life for it s ent er tain ing effect so that T V is take n as a way to sp re ad i nformation .
N ever th e less , te le v is ion b r ing s some ne g at ive effect s like mi s le ad ing a ud i ence or ex a g g er at ing the sit u ation s for pro g r a m need s .
T a ke for ex amp le , people with ment al i ll do n ' t mean they are v i o l ent , but ment al i ll is easily con ne c ted with v i o l ence in some so a p dr a m as .
F il m is similar to te le v is ion but with more dr a m at ic e le ment s .
In my point of view , f il m t ar g e t s on ent er tain ment rather than g i v ing i nformation .
T a ke the mo v i e of H a p p y F e e t for ex amp le , we all know that we are f a c ing the pro ble m of gr e en h ous e effect but there are not so much people take it serious .
A fter this mo v i e , more and more people started to conc er n about gr e en h ous e effect .
But the same like T V , there is too much ex a g g er ation to be good me d i a .
In my opinion , I would say b ook s are the most effect ive way of co m m un ic at ing i nformation , even b ook s are not well accept ed for every on e .
D o even te le v is ion and f il m are a b s o l ut e ly the most accept ed and well us ed me d i a .
In ter n s of a c c ur a c y , I do think b ook s are the most effect ive .
F ir st of all , the f o o d , dr in k s and to b a c c o were in the high er per c ent age than other it e m s .
The I re l and and T ur ke y , they were near by 3 0 % , On the other hand , the re st of n ation s f a il ed to re a ch at 2 0 % .
The S w ed en , the l ow est country , re a ch ed 5 . 4 % .
It has show n the different co un t ri es con s um er sp en d ing were quite different .
But most of b ook s which I want to read are English .
So , I start English study .
I ho pe this di ar y to con t in u e .
In f l u en z a is a f e w p re v al ent at my work .
A n e le ment ar y school is .
My co - work er have n ' t In f l u en z a at once .
She was n ' t va c c i ant ed every year .
She said that everything depend s on how you look at it .
To day , I did co m m un ic ation in English .
But it ' s a very little talk .
She went to H o k k a id o in J a p an on last week en d , and then to ex p l or e nature .
If I could speak English , I would do better co m m un ic ation .
Some time s I feel sorry to both er you for my l ow le ve l English .
I think that this is good ex pe ri ence for me to talk in English .
And I enjoy ed that talk very much !
if some day I di e . what I re g re t ?
the first thing is I never bu y something for my p ar ent s , and than k for them .
To day , I will me e t a co ll ed g e st ud ent who has job hu n ting .
She is e age r to re s ar ch many kind of job .
I want to help her speak ing my ex pe ri ence .
F at ty
F at ty was a very p l um p and o b e se guy when we were in sen i or high .
N ever th e less , he is very s le n d er now .
Yes ter day , I asked him if he is a v a il able this week en d to a c c o m p an y me to look for language ex change .
He said , `` S or ry , I have to j o in a comp ut er ex h i b i tion . ``
I re p l i ed to him , `` O h ~ great !
what a n ic e show , you can a b s or b new know led g e of comp ut er s . ``
He respon d ed to me , `` No , I just want to take some p h ot o s of show g ir l s .
If some on e da re s to de st ro y my s ch ed ul e , I s w e ar I will s l aught er him . ``
W ow ~ F at ty is so serious on it .
th a first di ar y .
it to be st u day ing to day .
and , it go tri p .
To day I visit ed one of my friend s who are my fellow English - l o ver s to have a meeting in English .
I like J a p an e se dis he s , so I had been look ing for w ar d to visit ing there .
To my s ad ness , one of our me m b er s was a b s ent from to day ' s meeting because her so n had a f ever and had to stay at home .
: D I thought I should have w or n k im on o .
I comp le te ly enjoy ed not only eat ing , but also see ing the ar t is t ic serve d dis he s .
made by his mother ( my w if e , of co ur ce ) : - )
I went to my friend sh op to day
I went to my friend sh op to day .
With them long time no see .
And , I did enjoy a b i con ver s ation .
F l o o d pro ble m in T ha il and is get ting better now in some are as , but is still c ri t ical in a p p ro x im ate 2 5 province s .
N e x t coming pro ble m may be a f o o d pro ble m .
My English is very poor so I ho pe the thing I write just as a story for other strange r s .
H ar u k i M ur a k a m i w a s u k i - n a sh ous e t s u k a de s u .
One last thing : If I want to as k my friend where in J a p an she us ed to live , can I say `` N i h on no do k o n i s un d e i mashi ta k a `` ?
I got in to u ch with friend s in H o k k a id o .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to go back to H o k k a id o in A u g ust .
My c ook ing was tired of eat ing .
C an you re c o m m en d good re c i pe s ?
I re ally like this language and I ho pe to get to m aster it some day .
I think that the only way to le ar n a language for re al is by us ing it with people who speak it every day , that ' s why I ' d re ally like to have some e ng l ish and am er ic an friend s who can help me to re a ch my go al .
H o pe to me e t new people through this wonder ful and us e ful we b s ite !
A fter I have tra ve led in A ust r al i a , I ' m being la z y person .
I like to take a picture .
B e c a us e picture re m in d s my me m or y .
So I try to take a picture when I go to new place .
R r c ent ly I c a n ' t take a picture .
To m or r ow I have to some where . ^ ^
As you do not c he c k my previous ent ry , I ' m not sure if you know that I ' m work ing in a n ur s ing home for people with sp e c i al need s .
A fter a d d ing some s ar c a st ic commen t to the begin n ing of my ent ry this time , I will begin the story of the girl .
To day was the first time for me to me e t her and the last time for her to come to the n ur s ing home .
A l th ough I c a n ' t im a g in e what I will have been do ing next year , her mother said she might come to the home next year .
I wonder ed how s ad it would be if she had had been living in the time .
I los t my b al ance and f e ll back w ar d .
I called for a help from other s ta f f .
I did n ' t get what she ' s going to do to me , though I wonder ed if she want ed to get on me again , she tri ed to put her little f o ot on my t high s .
My second f ing er is pai n s yet .
It ' s difficult I take ( us e ? ) a p en and other s now .
F ro m now on I have to more care ful about do or .
my ma ter n al gr and m o ther had an op er ation because she s u f f er ed from ch o le l i th i as is .
my mother came back home when I was as le e p .
I s l ept unti l 3 : 0 0 p m because I stay ed up all night watch ing a so c c er game .

So I saw mo v i e in my school .

I always end up to so l ve my pro ble m s by myself or have to i g no re them .
U n less you are train ed or have a t al ent of language you can not tea ch other people your first language .
It ' s not like ri ce c a ke , it ' s b re ad made of ri ce .
I re ally like one I can bu y in the near est b a ke ry .
I got up at 1 2 : 0 0 this morning .
I came from a p ar ent ' s home in F u ku s h im a p re f last night so I feel very tired .
But my ho l i day time limit is 3 day s and to day was R es pe c t - for - the - A g ed D a y in J a p an .

My thought
So , I think the w or d is right ' the command ment is a l amp and the teaching is light ' < P ro ver b s 6 : 2 3 >
To day I went to a ha ir so l on to have my ha ir c ut and co l or ed .
It has been while I entered a un ive r s ity , return ing my ha ir into black .
So when I ' m f a c ing a mi r r or ,

`` D i e t ``
My a c qu a in t ance ga ve to me big ro ll to day .

do ing that , I got at a los s c u z I did n ' t find out what I re ally want to know .
I have to do a l ot of things .
ex a m s are coming soon .
but I w an n a do what I re ally l o ve to do .

than k you .
To d y is fine and co o l .
C o m ing f a ll .
My work is bu s y .
I ' ve got a l ot of wonder ful me m or y and spoke l ot s of English .
So my di ar y need s c or re c ting as much as possible .
Even n at ive make a mistake , but I prefer to le ar n English near ly 9 0 % .
I ' ve got to en s ur e to study ing hard .
A c t u ally , d ur ing study a b ro ad , I certain ly study more than enough .
But I do n ' t stop le ar n ing .
I have just re g is ter ed myself to this L an g - 8 .
I ' m work ing at the A ir p or t that ' s why so e ar ly .
I wish to day w o n ' t bu s y day ( ^ _ ^ ; )
I thought the an s w e was ( a ) , but the answer is ( c ) .
C an you explain me why the answer is ( c ) ?
When we speak and write on J a p an e se , we do n ' t of ten us e the sub j e c t .
I study English now , I always us e the sub j e c t at writing .
D o es it need the sub j e c t for English ?
They w ro te a certain sha pe in black and w h ite on the b l an k me d i a .
I have never sp un one .
I could do that , but my so n could n ' t .
I had been p re p ar ed for ex a m about for 3 m on th s .
I thought the ex a m would be easy as I had been p re p ar ed it for a long time .
It re m a in s to be see n about ex a m re s ul t s .
I do n ' t feel like anything now .
I just want to catch up on sleep and take a re st .
And I ' ll start over a es s a y on la ng - 8 .
He al th c he c k !
In J a p an e se un ive r s ity , new se m est er start s in sp r ing .
A ll of them look so ha p p y .
I think they may feel ex c ite ment by fresh place .
A t the first of the se m est er , we should be c he c k ed our he al th condition .
C he c k point are body he i g h t , body we i g h t , eyes i g h t and b l o o d p re s s ur e .
In last year ' s c he c k , my he i g h t was 1 8 2 c m .
But in to day c he c k , it was 1 8 1 c m .
But pro ble m was my we i g h t .
T h ough my we i g h t was 6 8 k g in last year , it was 7 2 k g at to day ' s c he c k .
I gue s s this in c re a se came from a change of my life s ty le .
I b ough t a c ar last year , so I did not walk to go to my work ing place .
I must do my ex er c is e for my he al th !
When I was in my te en s , J a p an e se long ed for A m er ic an life , A m er ic an f il m and A m er ic an m us ic .
The ri ch est person in the world is not B i ll G ate , just M e x ic an guy .
The impress ive six th sen se te ch no l o g y was in v ent ed by In d i an te ch no l o g is t .
We have to say that ho pe for the be st and p re p ar e for the w or st !
Then you are cha ot ic ally look ing for de c is ion .
I ' d like to s l im down .
I ' d like to los e a b it we i g h t .
I ' d like to take in my w a is t a b it .
So I set as id e time of ex er s is e .
That ' s B e c a us e I ' m going to the sea on coming va c ation and I ' ll put on the s w im s u it .
I ho pe that I can los e we i g h t before va c ation .
To day I went to s w im .
But while I was s w im ing , I could for g e t bad things .
I think I will go to s w im .
I did n ' t write a di ar y since 2 month a g o .
I went N a g o y a last week .
Yes ter day , I went to di n er with my friend s .
We eat fish .
To day .
No w , I go to a bath h ous e .
I find those are us e ful and be w or th bu y ing .
But , the b ook s p ri ce is very ex p en s ive .
One is $ 1 3X .
A no ther one is $ 1 5 X .
And the not e b ook s p ri ce is $ 3 0 x 4 .
The to t al is $ 4XX .
F or t un ate ly , I have a V I P c ar d , it has dis c o u c t of 1 0 % .
I should hi t the b a ll more effect ive ly sp in .
a long time I do n ' t was here . .
now I have not time , be c ous e this year I have ex a m s . . .
and much time is sp ent p re p ar ing for it . . .
It was like yesterday when I started to go to j un i or high school .
It ' s the last year I ' m going to sp en d as a j un i or high school st ud ent , so I want to enjoy the re st of the day .
he ll o .
I ' m new to this S N S .
than k you for read ing this me s s age .
Yes ter day , I walk ed around my home because the whether was so good .
There are many tree of ch er ry b l o s s o m near my home , so I watch ed them with walk ing s l ow ly .
The f l ow er of it live very short , we are able to enjoy watch ing them in short terms .
B e c a us e of this I am sorry not to watch them ti ll next sp r ing , but I also think that it is the beautiful of f l ow er .
I b ro k en up with my b f last night .
he said he would f i g ur e out that what we or he should do from now ( he would f i g ur e out our re l ation s h i p in the future ) and would tell me next day .
but he ' ve never called me after that .
I ' m going to go to the ha ir s al on in the morning .
A fter l un ch I ' ll go to bu y a s u it for ch or us comp e t i tion .
I feel like bu y a s u it like co o l .
I want to us e ch er ish it from now on w ar d .
This is the first time I l o g in in L an g - 8 .

No w , I ' m le ar n ing K or e an , because I will tra ve l in K or e an on O c t this year .
I wish that I can over c ome this pro ble m before going to K or e an .
H o pe can make friend with every on e .
I of ten w and er . . .
I of ten w and er what is the mean ing of life ?
I do n ' t think there ex is t s a l o g ic ally reason able answer to it .
I took a day off to day .
Then I ' m writing my j o ur n al after a long in ter v al .
I started to study C h in e se because it is ne c ce s ar y for me now .
I of ten me t the for e i g n er s who do not le ar n the language even they stay the country long per i o d .
I can im a g in e , C h in e se character s are quite hard to understand for for e i g n er .
F or t un ate ly it is e as i er to le ar n C h i en se character s for J a p an e se , because we us e them in our language .
We ex p or ted the C h i en se character s to our language hu n d r ed s of year s a g o , and the mean ing of most of the w or d s are still same .
We do not understand when we speak , but can understand when we write .
( O f c o ur se , J a p an e se do not understand all of C h in e se character , because they us e much more character s . )
The pro n un c i ation is so difficult , but I would like to keep try !
when I mo v ed here , I knew no body . I want to make many friend s .
I ' m l on ly .
I written a letter in English , first time of my life .

To day , I went to S p or t c l u b ( is it right English ? ? ) as us a u al .

My dr e a m is In t ro d u ce our c ul ture for a b ro ad ; an im e , man g a and so on .

To day I talk ed a girl by cha t .
She l il ve s in U S , and study s to be n ur se .
She ha te s need le s and b l o o d s ,
Then I he ar her va ri ous things .
and her p ar ent s is not re al one .
When she was three year s old , her mother was de ad .
He r father do n ' t need her now .
She was gr o ing up at another p ar ent s .
She tell that alone is con f or t able . . . . .
He r c ar a c ter is c he er ful .
I think She will s p en d her ha p p y life .
I do n ' t know what do I say . . .
She is impress ive for me , j a p an e se .
B e c a us e I ' m the 7 th month of p re g n an c y .
I feel my body is he a v y but I have to work as usual .
I have a d aught er who is 2 year s , so have to look after her .
I wish to take a hot sp r ing bath and then have good f o o d s at a J a p an e se - style hotel
S ur e ly , it he el s me .
No w a days , I ' m so bu s y d u e to get a ho s p it al job .
I ' ve been try ing to im p ro ve myself like character .
Y e a h , , I agree too . .
But I have con f id ence this job very well , If they ' ll e m p l o y me .
F or t un e t ly , I heard to pass the 1 st t est of the K or e a U n ive r s ity M ed ical C ent er .
2 n d t est is an gr o up in er v i e w so this is more im p or t ant than 1 st t est .
If I pass this f in al t est , I ' ll work at S ever ance ho s p it al .
It has very good me d ical tea m , high te ch me d ical de v ic e and very kind s er v ic e .
This is not f it for me , but I want to go there .
I have been a ma th ma t ic s t ut or since 2 0 0 5 .
To day , I started to tea ch a st ud ent who I have tea ch ed 2 year s a g o , again .
He r gra d e is ter ri ble , so I c a n ' t sleep because I am w or ri ed about that very very de e p ly . . . .
How to tea ch ma th for her to be better ?
She have only 9 0 days to ex a m .
I w ro te not long , because I got dis c o ur age t by le ar n e ng l ish .
I ' m still at the same le ve l and I c a n ' t le ar n to more .
R e c ent ly I had de p re s ion because I did n ' t see the mean ing of life .
play po o ling
Yes ter day I went to play po o ling .
It was the second time that I play ed it .
The first time was in N an x un ( U R L ) .
I to t ally had no c l u e at that time and thought I would never go to play po o ling again .
But I made a big pro g re s s yesterday .
and mi s s every on e .
so bu s y for the se days , I just to say sorry .
I s there any on e who want to S k y pe ?
O f course I tea ch you J a p an e se as much as I can if you want to le ar n J a p an e se .
A n y way I have had a back a ch e since I had a co l d because I la y on my be d all the day and I had high f ever . .
No w f ever is go ne but back a ch e is get ting w or se so I ' m not will ing to school because I sit down on a ter ri ble hard cha ir while at least 9 0 minute s .
Besides almost p rofessor s only write the same as te x t b ook s at black b o ar d .
I want to gradua te this un ive r s ity as long as e ar ly and want to ent er other gradua te school or get a job which they have over se a ' s bra n ch .
F in ally a ut um n has come here .
M an y people had he at in j ur y in J a p an .
H ot s um m er is not only in J a p an , but also in E ur o pe .
I watch ed the new s that many R o s s i an people were dr ow n ed because they s w a m in the ri ver dr in k ing v o d k a for co o ling down .
I s this g l o b al w ar m ing effect ion ?
My work p la ce off er ed a he al th c ar e course at the after five on to day .
I felt it is f un but it is a little too hard for me .
I at e ch in e se f o o d .
It ta st ed y a m m y because it was free .
so I was re l i e v ed .
I for g ot to b r ing a th o o th b r us h .
No w , I am in the la b room ?
S ch o o l s w ot , sea r ch ing a job , and part - time job . . .
But also there is n ic e thing .
A girl who m I w ro te 1 th j o ur n al ga ve me a call .
I have n ' t said that , because she has a person who has a re l ation s h i p with her .
he said `` I like you all `` .
So after that , I ma il ed her `` I know your kind heart and ability to cha t s ence re ly `` .
I am so interest ed in W or l d C up he l d in So u th A f ri c a just one year la ter .
B e c a us e I am a J a p an e se , I ho pe J a p an w in s to other n ation al tea m s and go to at least se m i f in al .
But as long as I watch ed two qu al if y ing game s against U z b e k is t an and Q at ar , to W or l d c up , the re al ity would be different from what I ho pe .
To o bad , J a p an would los e , and could not go to even round 1 6 .
The ch o ic e is not t an e f f ic i ent way to get a go al .
J a p an e se play er have to le ar n how to us e the se ch o ic es like dr i b ble , pass or sh o ot in which sit u ation .
If this kind of play er s in c re as ed in J a p an , the po s s i b il ty to w in in W or l d C up would be a little high er .
E ver y sh op close d on C h ri st m as day .
In J a p an , this sit u ation have never happen ed .
U n like yesterday , many sh op s were on s al e and there were so many people in the c ity .
I felt like to day is N e w Y e ar s E ve ?
In J a p an , there is no di f f er ence between C h ri st m as day and 2 6 th , the next day .
It is because sh op s give you a l ot of dis c o un t before C h ri st m as .
A c t u ally , some sh op s in the c ity did n ' t give me a big dis c o un t .
That does n ' t mean almost anything .
But they usual ly se ll them at the same p ri ce , and I am not sure that they are re al one s .
I am very bra n d con s c i ous , es pe c i ally J a p an e se bra n d s , so I do n ' t usual ly bu y anything here .
I did n ' t bu y anything then ?
( I was surprise d that almost all water was go ne . )
I will go to O t f or d in the morning , walk to B un d e en a and stay there over night .
This is one of my favor ite qu o te from ' P o or da d and R i ch da d ' .
Let me in t ro d u ce my s el f in English .
I of ten listen to m us ic by in ter ne t .
When I was you ng , I be l on g ed to B r as s b and .
I ' m not particular about name of m us ic , I just have f un of it .
I wonder where their m us ic sen se from .
They are g if ted m us ic i an .
To tea ch some on e my mother language is f un .
I ' m not good at gra m m ar of my mother language but , at least I can j ud g e whether it is natural or not .
In a spirit s of volunteer , I ' ll c or re c t wrong sen t ence s as a n at ive speak er .
I may be wrong some time s , at that time , please for g ive me .
I have re al i z ed that J a p an e se was difficult through the teaching ex pe ri ence to no n n at ive speak er s .
What is the right ter m when a p at i ent of a ho s p it al is dis c us s ed , `` p at i ent condition `` or `` p at i ent state `` ?
There are a l ot of different s y m p t o m s ex is t s , a gr o up of do c t or s have a con ver s ation .
What of the two a b o ve p h r as es is c or re c t in this case ?
It ' s almost time my hu s b and come home .
There are C h in e se c a b b age and sp in a ch and J a p an e se ra d ish in the f ri g e .
A bout me at , I have be e f and ch ic k en and p or k .
What me n u can I c ook ?
I am not hung ry , so I do n ' t want to c ook now .
No w , my d aught er s u c k my f o ot f ing er !
English so ng s have full of very n at ive express ion s , id i o m s and some time s even st up id w or d s .
This so ng have re m a in ed in my mind since when I first come a cross it .
E s pe c i ally , I ' m in K y us h u , So u th - We s ter n J a p an , where is near K or e a .
So , I re c o m m en d you le ar n some J a p an e se p h r as es .
P er s on ally , I want you to us e `` Y o k ar o u - mo n ! ! `` , mean s `` ( what ever it is , ) it ' s good ! ! `` If you say this ma g ical w or d , people in K y us h u would be more kind as usual . )
O f co ur ce , I l il ke E u c l id as the great ma th e m at ic i an .
T ro u ble M a k er
I am to l er ant about my sub or d in ate ' s f a il ur e .
I am in v o l v ed in s ever al pro j e c t s , that is , I have s ever al bo s se s .
One of my bo s se s are a re al trouble make r .
E ver y pro j e c t me m b er s includ ing me ha te that my bo s se s always cause trouble .
I went to watch the H ar ry P ot ter mo v i e yesterday .
It was the last e p is o d e of the H ar ry P ot ter s er ies .
I enjoy ed the mo v ies of this s er ies as well as H ar ry P ot ter b ook s .
The ma in character s gr e w up through the s er ies in s ever al year s , the act or s and act re s se s did , too .
The last e p is o d e was interest ing .
But if you will go to see the mo v i e , you had better to read the original work before going to the c in e m a .
If you do that , you can enjoy much more .
s un s h in e in my w in d ow
s un s h in e in my w in d ow is very w ar m and feel ing good but outside is very very co l d with w in d y .
can you gue s s what I do ing ?
how about you ?
I had to work very hard in bu s y every day .
let ` s us enjoy with me .
I have go ne through va ri ous things that everything were good for me and work ed out , than k to my friend s , I m re ally than k ful to them who have s up p or ted me to live in A ri z on a .
The ch ance s are that you can not gue s s that how st up id I am .
A t le a se , I had have v o c a b ul ar y more or less .
However even though I spoke with A m er ic an people or In ter n ation al students , I did not f i g ur e out what they said clear ly .
at that time , I had been feel ing hu g e sen se of c ri s is and p re s s ur e .
A co up le of days la ter , I started English quite hard , every time I finish ed the class es , I went to l i b r ar y for study ing ; in addition to H ome w or k , I st ud i ed the gra m m ar b ook s which I had brought those from J a p an for a ra in y day .
A c t u ally it was a mar ve l ous ch o ic e , F or those could explain some gra m m ar style p la in ly with J a p an e se .
what is more , I have tri ed to a v o id from J a p an e se people in A m er ic a .
I think that U s u ally j a p an e se people who are going to un ive r s ity come here are not e age r to le ar n or study English in A ri z on a .
in addition to it , they always ha ng out with same country ' s people ; in fact , I mean t they are also J a p an e se .
To day is last day of may .
N e x t month is always start ra in y sea s on ! ! !
I do n ' t like this ra in y sea s on . . .
be c o se co m m ut e train become very hot and make me bad ! !
But this year , I have a good things ! !
My be st friend will going to mar i g e next month ! ! !
I ' m very look for w or d to see my friend mar i age ! !
He is very kind teacher , because he always en c o ur age ment to students .
I like to make a effort !
I have n ' t written a j o ur n al for a long time , but de c id ed to start again and write as many as possible this year !
However , I try to us e English as much as possible and even im p ro ve it .
R e ad new s p a p er
There f or e , I ' ll read new s p a p er every day if possible .
I do n ' t sub s c ri b e new s p a p er in my house , so I ' m going to the l i b r ar y to read it !
M a ke a tri p by myself
I ' ll go tra ve l some where in the world by myself !
I ' ll make it this year serious ly : ) As a start er , I ' m going to go bu y a loud al ar m clock to day that will de f in ite ly w a ke me up !
C er e m on y de c is ion !
I de c id ed w ed d ing c ent er this M on day .
I went to 2 w ed d ing c ent er s .
F ir st , it is like a gue st house and good at o m o s p he re .
It is a very con ve n i ent for me to work out a p l an for mar ri age .
But we do n ' t invite comp an y ' s person , so not to for m al w ed d ing .
M a y b e I think hotel get s a l ot of mar ri g e people per day .
So , hotel s ta f f do n ' t have a time for a pai r .
But I was to be re l i e v ed .
I was so ex er cited .
I can us e commen t f un ction
explanation of about J a p an e se honor if ic w or d .
I think that it is very difficult for a person from another country to
understand J a p an e se honor if ic w or d .
It is because even J a p an e se people c a n ' t speak it c or re c t ly .
I want to do my be st it ( ^ O ^ ) /
I in t ro d u ce myself a little b it .
I ' m a mar ke ter and a direct or for we b a d ver t is e ment .
My hu s b and is a s y s te m e ng in e er , but he quite d a job last year and has been p re p ar ing for be c a m ing a physical train ing in st r u c t or .
I ' m t w in s , have a t w in s s is ter .
I have also a brother over three year s old .
He and she live in Tokyo .
My ho b b y is c ook ing , read ing , fashion co or d in ate s , and ri d ing a ro ad b i ke .
To day I c ook ed sp a g he t t i e B o l o g ne se for l un ch and b a k ed a sea b re a m , ta i with ve g e t able s for dinner .
D o you know how to us e the pai d ho l i day in J a p an ?
My hu s b and to r ed his A ch il le s ' ten d on on 9 th of O c t or b er , and he has n ' t been able to work for two week s .
He asked his comp an y , what ' s do c u ment he will need to take his sick day from the comp an y .
H is bo s s answered him , ' If you have pai d ho l i day , you can us e it for your off the works , so then you do n ' t need any do c u ment s which is written by do c t or . '
A l m o st all J a p an e se e m p l o y e es do n ' t us e their pai d ho l i day , and they just us e it when they are poor ly .
I also did so when I had work ed , and had thought about it is or d in a ly things unti l I have been to U K .
I he ar ed from them how to us e their pai d ho l i day while I had stay ed there .
They sh o ud us e all of their pai d ho l i day in a year , and if they will be sick , they will have sick day .
One co ll e gue ' s hu s b and who is an I T con s ul t ant , said to me .
I was re ally surprise d to he ar from him at that time , because I knew that he is very bu s y man for his works .
I was en v i ous of U K ' s people very much , but almost all J a p an e se people never know n about the e ur o pe an people ' s work sit u ation at all .
But it is not ture or an wrong view of our life .
So he will be able to us e them when he has got any sick or in j ur y which he c a n ' t work .
If U K ' s people c a n ' t believe that , probab ly .
I ' ve read a ar t ic le that was re ally impress ive .
I have been thought a great de al of things which he is es s ent i al person who I can not live without him .
But I m e m b ar r as s ed to say that T H A N K T O U unti l now to raise me .
O f course I could not say this w or d in front of him .
If you guy s are able to understand this ar t ic le in J a p an e se , I would re c o m m en d you guy s to c he c k it out .
T t o day , I made sp a g he t t i .
When d ever I make sp a g he t t i , I felt pro ud of myself .
And I some time s try to make different kind of sp a g he t t i .
To day s sp a g he t t i was V on g o le .
I will try to other ty pe of sp a g he t t i n est time .
This t est ' s s c or e in f l u ence s to ent er a co ll age , to take a job and the c ar r er success .
A l ot of people so much study English to try to get a high s c or e of the t est .
Then , I want to know the va l u e of the T O E I C ' s high s c or e in the for e i g n country .
W o ul d you give me some commen t s of this them e ?
Yes ter day I me t in sh op my last class m ate A l ic e .
She has always been un f ri en d ly , g l o o m y and un s c o i able girl .
She had n ' t friend s , because her class m ate s did n ' t like her and did n ' t want co m m un ic ate with her .
But yesterday she gr e e ted me with a smile .
I was sh o k ed w n en I saw this change s in A l ic e .
And she le ar n ed the r ul es of co m m un ic ation and had new friend s .
To day is a beautiful day , I w a k ed up at 9 o ` clock , and had more de l i ous f o o d in the b re a k f a st .
in the after no on , I sea r ch in ter ent .
It see m s like a ti t le of comp o s i tion in C h in e se p ri m ar y school : p
I happen ed to see an e p is o d e of T V ent er tain ment pro g r a m m e last night .
To a ch i e ve this , she was de ter m in ed to s a ve l ot s of money to p re p ar e for a further study on da n c ing over se as .
That was ta u g h for a s ing le girl in C h in a .
She had to e ar n money in the day time and re v i e w da n c ing a ction s at night .
That was ha p p y ness she de f in ed .
I would like to say , If language is dr u g , then I am an a d d ic t ~
It does n ' t see m that she know how to co m m un ic ate well with people .
No w , it is 2 3 : 44 o ' clock .
In j a p an , there are many b ri ll i ant house s around my house .
A l m o st of ho se s are us ing many L E D light s .
B e c a us e C h ri st m as will come .
P ro b ably , I will bu y a D V D re c or d er .
The se fish are my pe t .
My father take s care of them every day .
U n t il last s um m er we had take care of two fish es about five c en time ter s .
When we started to keep them , the s i z e of them were about one c en time ter .
However , the s i z e of them had became big g er by fee d ing f o o d .
A t that time , I found that fish es also become s big g er like other an im al .
They ra re ly do n ' t know what is they live for .
S y m p a th y is the out st and ing person al ity .
A bout a month a g o , I went to C h i b a p re f e c ture to see Tokyo G ame S h ow with my friend s .
We went there by his c ar .
The even t started at 1 0 a . m . so that we had to left our home t ow n at 4 a . m . I ' m not good at get ting up e ar ly , but I could man age to get up .
On our way to the show , we stop p ed by all the s er v ic e are a , and at e many kind s of l o c al f o o d s .
Then we ar ri v ed at the place for the show a little behind s ch ed ul e .
The show was re ally c r ow d ed and was ex c it ing .
We could see many many new v id e o game s , and took bo o th girl ' s picture s .
I wish I could play v id e o game s who le day .
No w I ' m a d d ic ted to U l ful s which is one of J a p an e se most f a m ous b and .
A l th ough they ' ve already b ro k en up , their m us ic is ch er r ing people up .
They b r ing back me how wonder ful
l o ve of another person , even if I get de p re s s ed when he ar ing g l o o m y new s on T V .
He is a b s o l ut e ly a great est ar t is t in the world .
If you he ar he play s a co ver so ng `` B r ing It H ome To M e `` , you ' ll feel the go o se bu m p s of to u ch ed .
I ' m going to watch So t i al N e t w or k , to day .
To day I ' m p l an n ing to go to a ne i g h b or ing mo v i e the at er .
And I ' ll have some be er with a friend from p re s ch o o l days at night .
We ' ll me e t after 1 0 year s in ter v al !
It was long time to back here again .
I st ud i ed unti l now , a b o ur t 3 month s .
It was so hard time , but it ' s over now .
F or t un ate ly I was good at my t est , past sat ur day .
And I pass ed first gra d e for ent er ing m aster un ive r s ity .
And now there will be in ter v i e w on 5 S ept e m b er .
A fter t est , I took some re st .
But after to day , I ' ll e ar n some money , read b ook s , do train n ing ,
G o o d night there .
Some time s we talk ed s c ar y story .
B e c a us e In J a p an , long time a g o , there was not H a ll ow e en s y s te m .
This is a hot day , I do not want walk outside , but I do not want to have any en c o un ter with my un c le , I agree the require ment f in ally .
we see p and a 2 at the c in e m a , I watch ed it last week , it will never be a ha p p y ex pe ri ence when you watch a f il m t w ic e .
when we got back home , I read some b ook ( I read a b ook , name d j a v a 2 , should I say p age s ? )
T h re e hour s left to day , I need study something before I was te it ^ - ^
It ' s good to have friend s who are from another co un t ri es because it ' s f un to know each other .
A l th ough many simpl y have limit ed English pro f ic i en c y , I , as a s c i ence co ll e g e st ud ent and e ng in e er , have see n some high ly - ed u c at ed people who are c a p able of read ing and writing ar t ic le s in English , but have trouble ver b al co m m un ic ation .
I have been fee ing f r ust r at ed to see t al ent ed people who can not express their opinion d u e to English s k i ll limit ation .
I want to g u id e the se people to become co m m un ic at or s .
I want to take part in in ten s ive in ter a c t ive co m m un ic ation train ing class es to im p ro ve their English f l u en c y .
In my opinion , such train ing s are a p p ar ent ly mi s s ing in c ur r ent education in J a p an .
The T O E F L and T O E I C is co m m on ly us ed to me as ur e English pro f ic i en c y .
As a re s ul t , some comp an ies set mi n im um T O E I C s c or es for certain job ti t le s , thus people who have n ' t st ud i ed English for year s re st ar t English le ar n ing for a limit ed time for better position s .
E n t r ance ex a m in ation s for high school s and co ll e g es , and gradua te school require English in J a p an regard less of the ch o s en f i el d .
With the se fact s , the im p or t ance of English is o b v i ous .
I believe this is the a d ver se as pe c t of s c or e - c ent er ed c ur ri c ul um in J a p an .
S t ud ent s le ar n v o c a b ul ar y , how to an a ly z e gra m m ar str u c ture s , and how to tra n s l ate from English to J a p an e se and v ic e ver s a , but the ability to s y s te m at ic ally co or d in ate the se a b il it ies and co m m un ic ation s k i ll s are in s u f f ic i ent as is .
I believe a more b al ance d a p p ro a ch f o c us ing more on co m m un ic at ive ability would help im p ro ve English f l u en c y among J a p an e se people .

There are many English t ut or i al s about P h ot o s h op on the in ter ne t , and I am view ing them , so I am le ar n ing English and P h ot o s h op at the same time .

I have been watch ing A m er ic an D r a m a `` F ri en d s `` .

J o ke s may some time s be hard for no n n at ive speak er to understand
but still English us ed in F ri en d s is e as i er than other dr a m as .
My go al is to be able to pai n t man g a .

In this show , he was asked `` why do you keep play ing ? `` he answered `` So c c er tea ch es me everything `` .

I give me a pro m is e that to get a high s c or e in my G M A T ex a m , and to e f l ex a m .
I believe myself ~ !
To day has nothing sp e c i al , just a normal day .
However , I did one thing I ' ve always want ed to do - I f in ally sub m it ted one of my pai n ting s to the L i b er ty time s , one of the new s p a p er s in T a i w an .
It ' s act u ally not a long time after that thing , but it ' s see n ed to be a very long long for myself .
I thought I am now a ma ture , more con f id ence person , I start to sp en d more time on myself , and do not think about other people ' s things .
It ' s not mean that I do n ' t want to care about other people ' s thought but mean I had le ar n ed respect ed myself more and more .
A bout p ar ent s , It ' s time to comp ar e with them , because they are not he al th like before , you know what I want to say , every time when I think of that I feel very s ad , I c a n ' t change any thing but comp ar e with .
A bout l o ve , R es pe c t your s el f , that ' s the most im p or t ant thing I le ar n ed , if you want to give , just do it , never expect the fee d b a c k but respect your s el f , r u b her / him the right way is not the way you do , to be you s el f .
I went to a be a ch with my friend M a k i and A ly to day .

I am glad to do this .
No t because I was in v ent ed , but I am know n as a p h ot o g r a p h er which ful f i ll my sen se of a c c o m p l ish ment .
It does not take me so long to p re p ar e the le c ture .
That is what I f a m il i ar with .
However , many don not j ud g e me from the s k i ll of p h ot o g r a p h ing , they even do not see my p h ot o s .
To be a re al p h ot o g r a p h er need me to do p l ent y of p r a c t ic e .
And have a sh ar p in s i g h t .
The G o l d en week ( It is like J a p an e se ho l i day . ) pass ed .
But we had thought more nature place .
The all ro d e was made .
But we want ed to walk on nature ' s ro d e .
This is very f a m a us place .
We both got ex ce ll ent paper !
She a p p ar ent ly seemed to like it .
And we p ar ent were also ha p p y because we do n ' t have to take our time to ent er tain her
It was very tired day for me to day .
As I said in the previous di ar y , I work for a fact or y .
That mean s , I we ar work ing un if or m and he l m e t d ur ing work .
P e op le as s o c i ate s u it s and ne c k t i e with business person .
I co m m ut e in my c as u al we ar , and change c l o th es in a l ock er room of the fact or y every day .
It ' s easy to work .
I had already finish ed read ing some her works , for ex amp le , `` C on f es s ion s of a S h op a h o l ic `` .
I read it up to about 2 0 p age s to day .
If I read it 2 0 p age s every day , it will take 2 0 days to finish read ing it .
B e c a us e the P ul m on ar y P a th o l o g y T r a in ing S es s ion was he l d .
To t al 2 0 0 pe a p le part ic i p at ed in the s es s ion .
P a th o l o g is t s includ ing me were about 1 0 , R ad i o l o g is t s were about 1 0 , and R es p ir at or y p h y s ic i an were other s .
On sat ur day , the s es s ion started at 9 : 0 0 , it finish ed 1 8 : 0 0 .
That long time s es s ion we ar i ed me , but I was st im ul at ed with that con t ent s .
I read a English gra m m ar te x t b ook on the a ir p la ne to return .
I ' m a st ud ent in f a c ul ty of ar t s , C h ul al on g k or n U n ive r s ity .
In this s um m er b re a k , most of my co ll e a gue s will go a b ro ad to take some English course s ex c ept me because the p ri ce is too high .
I ' m not ri ch enough to pay for the tri p and I ' m not s m ar t enough to w in the s ch o l ar s h i p so that I can go a b ro ad for free .
It see m s so ch il d ish but I think I ' m a little b it s u f f er ing from pe er p re s s ur e .
I do n ' t know why but my English see m s to get w or se and w or se al th ough my ma j or is English .
In my litera ture class , I have to read a l ot of no ve l s and study a l ot of difficult v o c a b ul ar y such as ' de m y th o l o g i z e ' ( is there any on e who us es this w or d in re al life ?
- - ' ' ) , p at ri ar ch y and e t c .
It make s me feel like I ' m not even study ing hu man language .
I think it may be because I did n ' t p r a c t ic e enough so I started to read and write in English more .
As a re s ul t , I become a me m b er in this sit e ho p ing to de ve l op my s k i ll s .
T h an k you in a d v ance for your c or re ction

What is im p or t ant for our life ? What do we like most of all , family , friend s , world , comp ut er ? O ur world is v i o l ent and we must like something in or d er to live in it .
Some people think , that their family is the most im p or t ant thing in their life , that it help s them with different pro ble m s and always understand s them .
The same sit u ation is with friend s .
They always are read y to help you and you always can re ly on them .
There are a l ot of things , that we like , but are the things which can l o ve or help you ? I do u b t .
On ly our close person s or family are w or th of our l o ve and at ten tion .
E a ch person ch o o se im p or t ant things only for y or s el f , family , friend s , comp ut er or other things .
N e w Y e ar G re e ting C ar d !
I receiv ed 1 5 piece s of new year gr e e ting c ar d from friend s this year .
Some friend s ga ve me a gr e e ting c ar d by e - ma il .

F or ex amp le , ex ch an g ing e - ma il s with other re g ion s people and ma k ing a p l an to pro m o te our pro d u c t s to a l ot of part n er s .
But I re ally want ed to do something ir ri t at ing things to them .
So , I shout ed at them loud ly `` F u c k off me n , come on , I am here , you can get me , if you da re H A H A ! `` There was around 3 0 m long between me and them .
come on so n of a b it ch , I am going to f u c k your you ng er s is ter , o h sorry no body want s to f u c k such a u g ly mo n ke y H A H A !
you should as k other ma le mo n ke y s . `` One of them got off the c ar , and talk ed me back something , but I did n ' t mind at all .
As I told you , there was 3 0 m long between me and them , even though they had r us h ed me by their feet , I could have easily es c a p ed .
I found some stone s on the ro ad , I p ic k ed up them and th re w them to w ar d the black c ar .
I was too ex i cited , my head had full of a d re n a line .
A no ther ga ng s ter also got off the c ar , and said to me `` I am going to k i ll you ! ! `` I laugh ed at them loud ly .
A t that night , I could n ' t sleep at all , because I was ex it it ed very much .
My name is To m o who could es c a pe from the ga ng s ter s cha s ing l o l
I ' ve already been in the B o st on about six month s .
We are students so we do n ' t have enough money to take a a ir p la ne .
A t that time , I could n ' t sleep on the bu s even though I felt tired ness .
No t sleep ing on the tra n s f or t ation is a kind of my b i z ar re ha b b it .
I ho pe I am not tired and do n ' t become very sen s it ive person so I do n ' t get my friend s an no y .

They are not be l on g to any body and without home .
Yes ter day morning my mother told me that the mother c at felt very sorry because she had los t her b a b y .
What ' s wrong with her b a b y ?
She is so s ad and we feel very sorry for her as well .
And to day I knew the l ate st new s that two b a b ies of the mother c at have los t may b e for ever !
`` M i a ow ~ ~ ~ ~ `` , o h , poor ti n y little things , where are you ?
You r mother are sea r ch ing for U !
P le a se go home soon !
The l i b r ar y sen t me an e m a il to in f or m that a b ook I re s er ve through the l i b r ar y ' s H P was a v a il able .

It is the b ook I had once b or r ow ed but f an il ed to finish read ing by it s then d u e d ate .
I want ed to read it again so re s er v ed it two month s a g o .
A t last I got it .
However my e age r ness has f ad ed .
I like ra in y day , the ra in make me feel co m f or t able in my heart .
The ra in in M a y , like a far a way friend , b r ing s me a l o ve ly g if t .
But in ra in y day , I of ten think of many things and people in the past , it always make me feel l on e ly and s ad .
A f a m il i ar m us ic or a s ad mo v i e will w a ke up my me m or ies , by g on es of ten make me c ry , with the ra in outside .
I of ten tell myself : Let by g on es be by g on es .
To day is a g if t to me , I should t re as ur e the ha p p i ness by my side now .
I receiv ed a present from my p ar ent s .
There were many things in the bo x ; f o o d like a me l on and ch o c o l ate s ,

The mo v i e was very interest ing and it was for ma ture d people because it con tain ed some scene s which are not good for ch il d .
have a limit ed v o c a b ul ar y
I regard , ar d u ous to read English te x t s .
But for what ?
T th e se days I have watch ed the last est e p is o d e of G o s s i p G ir l , the p le as ing thing is that I think the story is coming back to normal , I mean the e p is o d e before were kind of ri d ic ul ous .
E ver y time watch ing the s er ies , I always feel un b el i e v able .
As the people in that s er ies are so ri ch and have ro x i ous live s that I c a n ' t im a g in e .
And in fact , I would l never have the live s like their ' s .
But this time , I saw a sen t ence that impress ed me .
The cha r a c t or of G o s s i p girl , N ate , he said `` G r ow ing up , I never knew what I was suppose d to be . . . `` .
H is saying was to u ch ing me .
I always try to find my way in the future or expect myself to do something , but in the end it see m s that I find nothing .
M a y b e not to think too much is the be st way to have good days .
I just at e f o o d and then come to c he c k la ng - 8 .
On new year I am going to U th a it an i c ity that is my home t ow n I was
When ever I would like to ce la b ate new year in B an g k o k th o un g .

T h an k you for coming my sp a ce .
T w ent y two year s old in no c ent guy .
I am study ing T O E F L to im p ro ve my English , so I am glad if you c or re c t my r and o m writing !
To m or r ow and day after tomorrow are ho l i day s .
So I am very ha p p y .
H i .
My name is No b u h i ro .
I want to speak English , so I ' m study ing English .
But , I have n ' t been us ing English for about 1 0 year s . . .
one day , I was talk ing with my friend on the p h on e .
some on e with you now ?
also I did n ' t play any m us ic and T V .
he said `` is there ch il d re n ?
but of course no body there .
I said `` is n ' t it your side ?
but he also said `` No no your side .
in c re as ed !
also he said `` still in c re as ing and some is c ry ing ! ``
I was very surprise and called him many time s .
but I could not catch him at the day .
next day , I went to his house .
he looked very tired but he told me what happen ed last night .
but s ud d en ly he heard the voice s close to one ' s e ar s .
at the same time , the right in his room went out .
and his room re s ound ed with big laugh ing of ch il d re n .
at next moment , he f a in ted away . . .
L e ar n ing English is not That E as y
I first f e ll in l o ve in le ar n ing e ng l ish when my first over se a tri p to E ng l and 1 5 year s a g o .
( even now it is still s u c k but a b it better I think )
In E ng l and , I visit ed many place s such as L on d on B ri d g e , M ad a m T us s a ud s , and many many more
This week , I saw `` W at er `` made by C an ad i an and In d i an s ta f f .
It is about live s of w id ow s , in In d i a , who are dis c ri m in at ed because of the H in d i b i ble .
The set ting is in an or p h an for w id ow s in In d i a in the 1 94 0 ' s ( probab ly ; G and h i is on the mo v i e ) .
In my view , it is so s ad , but I c a n ' t say it is e v il ' c a us e it is a c ul ture and re l i g i ous fact .
I have a respect for any re l i g ion as an at he is t .
I ho pe the dis c ri m in ation is f ad ing away though .
F ir st of all , many you ng people are like to tra ve l to other co un t ri es when they finish ing their study from high school for le ar n new c ul ture .
F or ex amp le when you tra ve l to E g y p t you will le ar n ar a b ic c ul ture and you will know what they are do ing in the free time .
A l s o you will le ar n some p op ul ar ar a b ic w or d s , and you will know what kind of f o o d they are eat always .
When you come back to your country may b e you should work for a f e w year s to p re p ar for study in un ive r s ity .
In my opinion tra ve l or work for a year it ' s will give the students a l ot of ex pe re in ce s make them success ful in the f ut u er .
It ra in ed he a v i ly to day , the who le day .
F or t un ate ly , It was not po ur ing
out there when I went to the school .
, however , to day was different from other days .
p rofessor s from our s is ter un ive r s ity , so it was re ally bu s y that my
B ad new s is we will hold another big con f er ence which could be just
and she is so easy to get n er v ous , even when there is nothing to
I always think she is a p s y ch o , ha ha ha .
W ri te to here , I s ud d en ly not ic e that the ti t le is kind of nothing to do
to day , I went to p la st ic s ur g er y and ha ir s al on .
s al on was very beautiful , but more ex p en s ive than that in t s u ku b a c ity and
I want to change the sh op next time .
after s al on , I went to p la st ic s ur g er y .
the do c t or said I have been mi l d de g re e of her n i a on ne c k .
I have to go to the ho s p it al t w ic e a week .
after dinner , I play ed a t able ten n is with ku g a .
I want to study e ng l ish from now ! !
I ' m re c ent ly p re p ar ing for T O E I C and O P I c
D o you know about the T O E I C and the O P I c ?
T h o se are English pro f ic i en c y t est s .
The T O E I C is require d to listen ing and read ing s k i ll s , and the other de m and or al pro f ic i en c y .
In K or e a , if you want to get a job at one of the be st comp an y , then you would need to mar k a high s c or e of the t est s .
G r ant ed that I become sen i or in un ive r s ity , I have to get and im p ro ve my s c or e .
M a y b e I could easily in c re a se my T O E I C s c or e re l at ive ly un like the O P I c .
S pe a k ing in English is very hard to me .
How could I speak in English with f l u en c y ?
That ' s it , I ' m half a c ent ur y !
I ce le b r at ed this b ir th day with my family .
5 O year s between me m or ies and future !
This week , we `` ll re t ur n to `` light er s me al s `` .
No w , J a p an e se w is ter i a is full b l o o m in a near b y p ar k .
It is sweet with the s c ent of the f l ow er around here .
I l o ve the co l or of j a p an e se w is ter i a .
It is the gra d ation from light p ur p le to de e p p ur p le .
M a y b e we p ul led to w ar d each other . : D
It ' s just s simple question .
The st ation a ly w h it ch us es for er a se the p en c il w ir it i g is called ' er as er ' in A m er ic a , and ' r u b b er ' in E ng l and , right ?
Then how do you say the one which us es for er a se cha l k writing s ?
I think ' er as er ' is O K , but ' r u b b er ' sound s we ir d , because it ' s not made by r u b b er ?
To day , I work ed hard and was very ex ha ust ed .
So I qu it ted to go to g y m to work o ut !
It was a game of the so c c er J a p an re p re s ent at ive yesterday .
I did not expect it of the so c c er J a p an re p re s ent at ive either .
E ver y night , as soon as I go to be d , he came and p re s se s his no se against my face .
This mean s `` Let me get into your co m f or ter `` .
So I p ul led up my co m f or ter , and he s l i p s into a sp a ce in my under ar m .
He ne at ly hu n ch es himself and put his ch in on t o my ar m , and then , s i g h s with sat is f a ction .
This sound f i le was made by me and my A m er ic an friend who is le ar n i g J a p an e se .
I me t her another co m m un ity ( not L an g - 8 ) .
We , for the first time , a c ut u ally talk ed to each other .
Yes ter day my school f ri en d told me about her s um m er - l o ver ( he he ) .
He is p rofessor of It al i an in U S A and he said he ' s so much a d d ic ted to Russian litera ture ( . .
and may be Russian girl s ? . . ) , es pe c i ally D o st o e v s k y .
- W h o le world l o ve s him ! - said I and indeed it is .
You know who was b or n in the same d ate , do n ' t you ?
But in all so c i al ne t s is written the d ate of No ve m b er 3 r d .
I never could n ' t have a one part y .
This is not a b ir th day day , this is b ir th day week . )
A m on g my friend s we have a tra d i tion do not give the present s in the proper day .
- I ' ll give it to you once la ter , when you w o n ' t wait it .
So , I ' m already us ed to this so much , that when they present ed me something it was more s ud d en er .
Even my brother , who never r ame m b er the d ate of my b ir th day ( but you can see it ' s not a pro ble m ) ) , said me that all what I pai n t is s u c k and present ed me a picture . )
No w I ' m think ing all my present s is so am us ing , so f an c y , it ' s because they re ally are , or because I did n ' t wait it ? )
I did ma th m at ic s and J a p an e se It was f un that I did H ome w or k .
In S um m er va c ation , I went to C o un t ry to tea ch the students .
P e op le say that S up p or ting E d u c ation .

B e f or e de p ar ture , I had to do many things unti l 2 4 : 0 0 .
A l th ough tired , but I feel H a p p i ness .
When I was stand ing the P o d i um , I was very N er v ous .
But the students very friend ly , they help ed me C o m p le ted my first show .
A fter a long in ter v al , I ' m writing a di ar y .

So I had V o l un te er ed , but it f a il ed .

I ' d like to ha ng out other are a and find some good stuff next time : )
A woman w ro te a heart b re a k ing con f es s ion in a co un se ling ar t ic le of a ma g a z in e .

The ra p is t was her s is ter in law ' s hu s b and .
He r hu s b and was treat ed at a ho s p it al and her s is ter in law was at the ho s p it al to visit him at that time .
The woman told her s is ter in law about the incident .
He r hu s b and and her s is ter in law prefer to s a ve their face s from e m b ar r as s ment .
He r s is ter in law a d op ted the woman ' s so n as an act to re d e e m her hu s b and bad de ed .
U p unti l now , her so n know s her as his a un t .
A n y s an e mother would l o ve to be re c o g n i z ed by her own f le s h and b l o o d but tell ing the tru th might make the so n to ha te the or i g in of his ex is t ence .
No t because of his p ur e l o ve of G o d that as p ir es him to be a past or .
To day I read ar t ic le about different way s to be ha p p y .
One of them is write five it e m s about s m th , that was please d to you every day .

On sat ur day I went to g y m with J im m y , we play ed b as ke t b a ll to g e ther , and we enjoy ed it very much .
On s un day , I went to my c ous in ' s school , he is ma j or in co o l , and he c ook ed some f o o d s for me when I want to go back to home .

L a st S un day , f in ally , my so n has be able to ri d e a b i ke himself .
But I answered that we go there with b i ke to g e ther for a while .
I s ' The E x c it ing S at ur day ' c or re c t translation ?
This was my so n ' s e le ment ally school even t .
A t the entrance bo o se , he show ed a st amp ma p which was give n at school and I asked the re ce p tion is t mother one more st amp ma p for my d aught er .
There were many game s , such as , H ul a - H o op T h r ow ing G ame ( a con pe t i tion how long me ter they th r ow ) , C at ch ing P a p er With C h op st ic k s , S c o op ing W at er W a ll o on , D ro p p ing 1 Y en C o in to the b in s in an a qu ar i um tank , P it ch ing G ame , and so on .
A l s o there were sh op s s el ling j u ic e and s el ling c he a p sweet s
that were called `` da g ash i `` .
And there was a bo o se g i v ing s n ow c up with s y r up s as a present to who m they did three game s .
There was a bo o se of tea ce le m on y .
That was open ed from 9 : 0 0 to 1 3 : 0 0 .
We end ed almost the game at 1 2 : 0 0 , so we return ed home .
We went there with b i ke and that was my so n ' s first time to ri d e his b i ke to go some where .
I was an no y ed about his a c c id ent s but he could ri d e s a f e .
When we return ed home , we me e t a for e i g n teacher and a p up il girl of the English S ch o o l .
I thought that they would be able to go to the even t .
That ' s an even t of this co m m un ity .
So , if the school is the me m b er of this ne i g h b or f o o d co m m un ity ,
they would go there .
A t 1 6 : 1 0 , my so n will go his s w im m ing school .
I ' ll leave my d aught er at my p ar ent home and go the e le ment ally school .
I think I would be able to come home after 3 0 minute s , so I said him that if there were no person in home , please wait the entrance of the a p ar t ment bu il d ing . . . . .
W i ll I be in time for his coming home ?
I ' d better get a mo ve on !
I read about them on ma g a z in es but never listen ed to their so ng s very serious ly .
However , that was such an am a z ing show that it has st ir r ed my interest in the b and !
M an y j a p an e se comp an y a d op ted The t est for job hu n ting .

why , why a d op t many comp an y want to t est L in e ar f un ction and F a c t or i z ation ?
When you want to bu y me l on 5 0 0 y an ( f i x ed p ri ce ) , You have 1 0 0 y an co in s and 5 0 y an co in s and 1 0 y an co in s .
How many way s of pay ing me l on are there do you have ?

But one of the c at s name d `` W ow `` has much loud er voice than any other c at s .
He has re ally `` w ow `` voice es pe c i ally when he us ed to as k something to eat .
But most ly , they are very quiet and sp en d their time s to sleep .
Some time s I wish I were c at and sleep all day and they were hu man to fee d me .
What is the three people le ar n ing ?
If you le ar n only by he ar ing , you will be easy to for g e t , but if you addition ally tell some on e what you have le ar n ed , you will be hard to for g e t .
To tea ch some on e is not only some on e ' s le ar n ing but also ma k ing you be hard to for g e t what you le ar n ed .
How to get the f and a ment of other language s

cha t on the p h on e
I got a call from old friend .
I ' ve been still mar ri ed .
I know I ' m work - ho l ic , right now .
and I for g e t how do I enjoy my life . . . . .
I had a night - mar e last night .
It was when I was an ar m y life .
However it ' s not p l an ed and there are many d v id ence s .
As soon as police start a sea r ch , I would be ar re st ed by them .
While I had a trouble d mind , I p re ten ed not a c ri m in al .
And I w o ke up then .
To day morning a tru c k hi t a p ed est ri an on the street .
We n t to C h ur ch for the F ir st T im e
In C h in a , C h ri st is not p op ul ar .
S p en d ing C h ri s m as , a for e i g n f est i v al , in a `` for e i g al `` place sound s very interest ing .
To day , I ' d like to write about the way of think ing .
There are a l ot of think ing style s and they are p u b l ish ed on some business b ook s .
A l ot of way s that I am face d with .
O f c ous e the be st way is different , but I act u ally think it is w or th think ing the conc ept of de s i g n ing .
L ook ing for the es s ent i al e le ment s is a good conc ept for do ing something c re at ive , I gue s s .
I ' ve mo w ed all the f i el d where my mother keep s to gr ow ve g e t able s .
My mother was sat is f i ed with the clear f i el d .
B e c a us e my w if e does n ' t like pe ar s very much , I do n ' t eat them so of ten even though I like pe ar s very much .
B e c a us e of a tra f f ic j a m on the high way , when we were on the w in d ing and r u g g ed ro ad , the s un almost went down .
A t that moment , I could n ' t help but im a g in e we a ther something would r us h and show up s ud d en ly .
You know what I talk about `` The T e x as C ha in s a w M as s a c re . `` ! !
I ' m the kind of people who gr ow up in a big c ity , so I have less ch ance to con ta c t with nature .
D ur ing the 2 - day tri p , I p ic k ed up w o o d , ro d e a A T V ( all - ter r a in ve h ic le ) on a w o o d ed p a th , and o b s er v ed de er s and ho g s .
And that mean s the ex a m s are around the con er .
O h , no , again !
It see m s that the C h in e se students are more an x i ous before ex a m s , comp ar ed with other s n ation s ' .
P er ha p s it is d u e to our es u c ation s y s ter m - you come to school to study , the school give s you a mar k on your paper .
And that ' s all .
M a y b e the opinion is too ra d ical , we should see it in different light s .
We see world through our co l or g la s se s .
I m p ar t i al ity is what every on e p ur p s u e , but no one s u c ce ed .
Well , no more w or d s .
The ex a m s are p ri or ity now .
R e v i e w , and get a good mar k !
I take a two English class es in U n ive r s ity .
The another is in ten d ed for J a p an e se students .
M o st students are act ive to the class .
I think teacher try to tea ch ent h us i a st ic ally and he is good teacher .
I have only me m or i z ed the te x t b ook before ent er ing un ive r s ity .
But the sit u ation have change d since ent er ing un ive r s ity .
We have to think de e p ly and act b as ed on my will .
So , I try to ar gue with many people not only me m or i z e the know led g e .
M a y b e , in other co un t ri es , it is stand ar d that students have a ch ance to dis c us s , but
The go ver n ment need change the education s y s te m . . .
l i b r ar y you will be the most p re c i ous place I have ever go ne
if you as k me the be st place I have ever go ne .
I will tell you the answer is l i b r ar y .
when I am a fresh man of un ive r s ity , the big g est feel ing is that I am free .
like a b ir d f le e from a c age .
the un i qu e thing in my mind is that ; `` I will only do things I like `` .
but now I know that it is a so da ng er ous idea .
no one will give me re st ri ction s sound s like a good idea .
in re al ity it is ha r m ful to me .
why it is ha r m ful to me ? because I am a d d ic ted to comp ut er game s .
I sp ent about half a year in comp ut er game s .
unti l one day I entered l i b r ar y
the first sight I saw is so many she l ve s with b ook s .
I like English , so I p ic k ed up a English no ve l called <prideandprejudice> , a f a m ous no ve l written by J an e A us ten .
I like the no ve l so much that I read it s ever al time s .
and then I find that I was in l o ve with no ve l , so I read a l ot of no ve l s by different write r s .
so l i b r ar y is the most p re c i ous place I have r go ne in my co ll e g e life .
The reason why I ent ry this sit e is to im p ro ve my English s k i ll to study a b ro ad in near ly future .
So , I ' m a p p re c i ate all your me s s age s .
He ll o ! !
I have living in In ch e on with my f a m l i y and p up p y . . ( ? ? )
I want to do e ng l ish well ! !
I try ! ! ! ! ! !
I go to the H an S h in un ive r c ity .
M a th is so hard but I like it .
I ha te to m at o .
I do n ' t like to m at o s m e ll .
My favor ite is to play with my p up p y .
I l o ve my p ud d le .
Some time s I for g ot to do , because of bu s y works , he a v y dr un k ing . . .
So , I want to con t in u e do ing .
I thought it was interest ing to as k .
may b e my English is w or se than before : ( I ' ve been bu s y , but I know I got ta study hard . . . .
I c a n ' t find what I w an n a write any m or e . . . : (
she will come back in O s a k a this s um m er : D
I visit ed the V at ic an m us e um , the P ant he on , the T re v i F o un tain , the C o l o s se um , the P i a z z a di S p a g n a and the
And I went to F I R E N Z E by the E ur o st ar train .
The R O M A and F I R E N Z E were very sp le n d id town for me .
T h an k s ~ ~
T h an k s for my friend s to require my me s s age .
A n y way , T h an k s ~ ~ ~
and I ' m living in Ka g o s h im a .
I was study ing English .
but I have a l ot of w or d that no mean .
and this di ction ar y is very he a v y .
I watch ed a mo v i e name d L an Y u
this f il m is talk about ga y guy s ~
kind a like b ro ke b a c k mo un tain ~
and the act or is Y e L i u
see m s this mo v i e is his f a m ous one
and because it he w in the T a i w an ' s G o l d en H or se ' s B est A c t or
but it ' s not ha p p y end ing
co s Y e L i u de ad at last
a l o ve about two me n
a l o ve de e p er than a man and a woman
I think some time may b e I can watch b ro ke b a c k mo un tain
I still like the l o ve about man and woman
I think S k y pe is very us e ful to le ar n a for e i g n language .
However , speak ing and listen ing are more difficult to le ar n than them because you are in limit ed in op p or t un ity to talk with a person who speak s your le ar n ing language .
you know , I ' m very sh y ! ! !
I wish I had co ur age ! ! !
To day , I in t ro d u ce one of my favor ite s ing er , A ng e la A k i .
She is f a m ous in J a p an re c ent ly .
( * _ * ) So I ra n to m us ic st or e to bu y her C D next day .
It was n ic e C D .
Then her conc er t was also n ic e !
He r talk was am us ing to us .
The X ' ma s conc er t will hold in B ud o u k an where is one of the big g est ha ll in D e ce m b er .

The ma p le re e f is re ally n ic e .
I think it is more beautiful than the 1 0 c ent s co in !
The other day , The e ar th qu a ke see m s to have happen ed in the United States .
C on s id er ing the w or st case when I heard it .
B e c a us e , it happen ed when I was re m in d ed of 3 . 1 1 .
But , D e a th s were not in this e ar th qu a ke .
When an e ar th qu a ke in J a p an , there was a little small e ar th qu a ke two days before 3 . 1 1 .
I ho pe that it is not for es h ock .
[ 5 ] Why do you read such a strange b ook which has a l ot of an im al ' s hi p s .
but without s u f f ic i ent comp ut er s k i ll s u will get con f us ed by your ma c some time s , here are some ti p s & trick s I have found from my da i ly us e .
I finish ed p re p ar ing the dinner and now I am dr in k ing gr e en tea .

D ur ing the study s es s ion , de po s it s in a n ur se ry next do or .
I still can not de c id e to part ic i p ate in to day ' s study s es s ion .
N e ar ly a week , ch il d re n have con t in u ed to c ry at night , we are tired .
He re I have got an English n at ive friend !
So each of us need s other s ' help .
But it is a little difficult to me e t with a n at ive speak er .
F or t un ate ly , I have got help from two of them .
B e c a us e I have a he y f ever .
I mi s s the little girl live d inside of me
G r ow ing up is a pai n ful and l u c k y thing .
A t that time I have done and said l ot s of fool ish things .
A t that time am just a co w ar d ly girl who get un f a ir treat ment from other s and can t stand up for myself .
A t that time am just a u g ly d u c k ling where my class m ate s think am u g ly and treat me as nothing .
But at that time I am kind I never go s s i p about other s .
A t that time I am than k ful for any on e who is being kind to me .
l A t that time I l o ve look ing at s k y just because it ' s p ur e b l u e .
No w , am not that little girl any m or e .
I think t w ic e before I speak , I can hu r t other s back if they ever hu r t me .
I have people who back me up , because they like s me .
I don t have time to look at s k y any m or e , since I am bu s y to give other s who I need a b a b y like smile to make them like me and read ing l ot s and l ot s fashion ma g .
L ook ing at the p h ot o I took when I were a kid the p a th etic little girl is so o o o o u g ly .
If you me t a u g ly short sh y little girl please be n ic e to her , don t hu r t her or do anything to let her change , let her be a a ng el a little more while .
C an you de s c ri b e one of your co ll e a gue s that you work with ?
He is always smile .
A l s o He is short , only one hu n d r ed se v ent y ta ll .
He does we ar g la s se s , always we ar co t ten p ant s .
The next day , a re un ion part y will be he l d and I will me e t my old class m ate s at my e le m n ta ry school .
I work ed in the sh op as a volunteer in the morning and I went to the y o g a class in the even ing .
The S up er M o on is a mo on which is the most near est dis t ance from the e ar th and it is full mo on at the same time .
It is kind of a o v al .
And a ccord ing from some new s , it is the first time for 1 9 year s !
I should re f le c t on myself who did no n of things which I had de c id ed to do .
I can p r a c t ic e my e ng l ish and my j a p an e se a l ot and me e t a b ro ad people
We go for a ri d e , we speak in e ng l ish
On hot days , of course co l d be er and on co l d days in w in ter we also l o ve co l d be er with hot dis he s .
On the con t r ar y the up p er class people in E ng l and l o ve to dr in k be er of the normal te m p er a ture .
If it is tru e , please tell me the reason .
It depend s on the c l im ate s ?
When my ho st f a ther dr an k be er with ic e , I thought it was very strange .
B e c a us e it was the first sight for me .
I s it normal for people in the U .
I like k y ot o
I ma j or ed in me ch an ical te ch no l o g y , es pe c i ally he at transfer .
I de ve l op new pro d u c t s of a ir condition er s ma k ing us e of the te c k no l o g ies I le ar n t the se days .
T er e f or e , I go to K y ot o s ever al time s a year with my family .
I like the ga r d en of G in k a ku j i - temple ( S il ver temple ) .
I like T e t s u g a ku - no - mi ch i ( P h il o s op h er s ' tra il ) , too .
It has been over week since e ar th qu a ke and T s un a m i hi t J a p an .
I believe that my office bu il d ing is e ar th qu a ke - pro o f , but now the bu il d ing is ' t strong er than before .
But any way , my English teacher ga ve me very n ic e p h r a se `` E ver y c l o ud has a s il ver l in ing ``
M or e o ver we will need to im p ro ve our live s and get them better than before e ar th qu a ke !
F in ally I started L an g - 8 .
My English s k i ll is not le ar n yet ,
but I will le an English per f e c t ly .
B e c a us e some on e tea ch me English .
I speak J a p an e se as mother to n gue , G er man f l u ent ly and English limit ed .
I le ar n ed for one year S w ed ish and C h in e se at the U n ive r s ity in G er man y because of those interest ing into n ation s .
I comp le ted my st ud ies in the sp r ing of 2 0 1 0 and started work ing in the a ut um n in the same year .
I w an n a im p ro ve my English s k i ll s , but I ' m too la z y to le ar n English language . . .
So at least I try to watch ing D V D s in English , to write di ar y every day and to read paper s about language a c qu is i tion , p h on etic s e t c in English .
R e c ent ly I thought that most of people are r ud e and a ng ry , so , to be honest , I did n ` t like them .
E ver y s un day I go to the ch or us at 1 1 o ` clock .
That day my father brought me to the place .
But after 1 0 minute s , that I sp en d sea r ch ing for any body , I understood that my teacher and friend s - s ing er s are not there . . .
O k , I de c id ed to go home .
Then I understood that I have no money to pay for bu s !
But my street was so far away !
But un e x pe c ted ly I get an idea !
I could call my father and as k him to b r ing me home !
So , I not ic ed a l ad , stand ing near the c a f e and listen ing to the m us ic .
I asked him what I want ed , and he smile d , g i v ing me his `` no k i a `` .
I smile d in respon se and entered father s number .
But he was too far from me , so , he could n ` t help me !
I saw 1 0 r u ble s , la y ing in my hand .
I r ing ed off and looked at him .
I re ally did n ` t know what to say , ex c ept loud and since re `` than k you very much ! `` .
That is not very great de al , but I think that now kind ness is the her o ic de ed !
A r t ic le 1 3 0 . - In or d er to re d u ce the a c c id ent ra te s and the v ul n er a i b il ity of pro d u c t ive un it s when face d to c l im ate con ting en c ies , the In ter - S e c re ta ri al C o m mission , in co or d in ation with the state go ver n ment s , sha ll set pro d u c t ive re - con ver s ion pro g r a m s in re g ion s affect ed by re c ur r ent natural dis aster s and l ow pro d u c t i v ity .

It has turn ed S ept e m b er .
So , I think that the te m p er a ture is n ' t hot re c ent ly .
I ho pe co o l days in a ut um n .
She live s in J a p an for more 2 0 year s .
So she has the M al a y s i an friend who m had the j a p an e se hu s b and .
This is the story when his f un er al .
The me th o d of the mo s l im f un er al is the b ri al .
But in the case of j a p ne se B ud d h is m , it c re m ate s a c or p se and put s a bo ne in the p ot by the ch op st ic k s .
The c re m in ation is de c id ed by a law in J a p an , and the b ri al is per m it ted only in some very f e w are as .
And ma la y s i an two people part ic i p at ed in his c re ment ion un w il ling ly for the f ir t s time . . . .
H is w if e f a in ted many time s and c ri ed , and then , the teacher was s c ar y of the hu man bo ne , too and re ally ha ted c a ch ing the bo ne by ch op st ic k !
because I have n ' t thought that the bo ne was s c ar y so far when f un er al .
And , be s id es , I looked by work many time s now .
A fter all is every body s c ar y of the hu man bo ne , too ?
H op ing to mo ve into the c l o ud - b as ed money man age ment
Some , such as We s a b e , and S h ry k , has already close d .
He re is my request for the money man age ment s er v ic e :
# 1 free or a little b it of run n ing co st , less than U S $ 5 per month
I can not us e m ul t i - by te character in account al i as es and me r ch ant ent ri es .
O F X f il es provide d by J a p an e se b an k s includ es m ul t i - by te character s , so I can not im p or t my O F X f il es c or re c t ly .
I sen d e m a il to the s up p or t tea m a little while a g o .
I think that M o st J a p an e se b an k s are out d at ed , because they do n ' t provide such too l s re p or ting and tra c k ing c ash f l ow , an a ly z ing f in an c i al state ment , and s up p or ting to a ch i e ve our f in an c i al go al .
I ho pe they p l an s to provide them .
I s there any money man age ment s er v ic es you re c o m m en d ?
But very beautiful and kind town .
My town have good f o o d , good P e op le , beautiful nature and interest ing history .
P le a se come country in J a p an some time .
L ate ly , a l ot of ra in y days .
I ha te ra in y , because it ' s trouble s ome for me to walk under an am b re ll a .
So , I never go any where to day .
I want to going back to sleep .
I s J a p an e se th in ?
My father is as high as me , he get s a w h ite ha ir and f at .
Then my teacher said `` f at ! ? `` .
She and other p up il s thought J a p an e se is usual ly th in .
But I did n ' t think he was very f at like for e i g n people .
He is a little f at ter than me .
And they knew `` s um o `` , so they said `` s um o is f at , is n ' t it ? `` .
So I ' m very ha p p y that they know `` s um o `` .
It is difficult to explain , but I always r u in my live .
When everything bad I try to be strong , ha p p y , help ful , c he er ful , but when everything is great I begin to see m s s ad , n er v ous .
may b e some on e know s the answer or have idea , w h ite as soon as possible !
You can at ten d E S L ( English as a S e c on d L an g u age ) course s which are he l d in the United States with your T V .
And the class is he l d in N e w Y or k C ity of the United States .
So if I w a c th it , I would at ten d the class with them without going to N e w Y or k .
T e a ch er s speak only in English , and also students do .
I think that can be good ch ance to some on e who is going to study a b ro ad in the future , but also any on e who want to study a b ro ad in your house !
To day I got my new I D C ar d f in ally .
In the no on , after had la un ch , I went to ra il way st ation to b ough t tomorrow ' s ti c k to go N an J ing .

When I walk ed into g en er al office , I heard a w ome n said that it ' s ho r ri ble while b ri c k s bu m p to g la s se s .

When my friend have n ic e mo o d , it s ud d en ly going to affect me in n ic e way without re al i z ing it .
H i every n at ive e ng l ish speak er s !

However , too l us e and we a p on ry and c ul ture and s y m b o l ic co m m un ic ation , which were once thought to be un i qu e to hu man s , have now been found in ch im p s and other sp e c ies .
The g l o b al i z ation has been ex ten d ing to even in ter n ation al mar ri age l ate ly .
I ra n a cross an ar t ic le to day , which say s something about `` in ter n ation al mar ri age `` .
In that ar t ic le , it see m s that J a p an e se go ver n ment has been wonder ing if it sign up the H a gue C on v ent ( * ) or not .
B e c a us e there are different way s of think ing about mar ri age and family from those of other co un t ri es .
On the train I saw a b a b y girl in a b a b y c ar ri age who was saying to her mother `` M o m , mo m ! `` and seemed to want her mother pay at ten tion to her .
This scene re m in d ed me of the sit u ation that a girl want ed her bo y f ri en d do so .

D o you know some good we b s ite ?
E x change la ng u a j e
H i again , this time I want to as k for same body that to be le ar n ing sp an ish .
My ing l ish le ve l of con ver s ation it ' s better than my w ri t ting , but I need to p r a c t ic e a l it le more .
I d ' on t mind if your sp an ish le ve l of con ver s ation it ' s not very good , I think that to g e ther we can im p ro ve our c u al it ies .
If you are the so r t of person that I ' m look ing for , please con ta c t with me .
I ra n to work as I was listen ing to M J ' s so ng s this morning in we t we ther g e ar s because it was ra in ing hard .
I want ed to run with his , but I did n ' t have enough time because the dance less on was wait ing for me .
The so ng s ga ve me a l ot of en er g y to run ( or for run n ing ? )
I ' m going to run home with his so ng s again ^ ^
It ' s not my business but their own business .
My w if e always told me that I should write about serious to p ic s with for m al w or d s and express ion s like other J a p an e se people .
What kind of to p ic s do you usual ly talk to your friend s ?
D o you of ten us e for m al w or d s with a str a i g t face on your usual con ver s ation s ?
No way .
When I was in J a p an , I always cha t ted with my friend s about many kind s of to p ic s from the s i z e of our di c k s to the cause of g l o b al w ar m ing in J a p an e se .
But more than 8 0 % of our to p ic s were quite st up id .
However , this is a re al co m m un ic ation , do n ' t you think so ?
I do n ' t say for m al English express ion s are not im p or t ant .
But writing and read ing about only serious to p ic s are pretty b or ing for me .
In my opinion , hi t ting on a l o c al girl , ma k ing a l o c al close friend and having ar g u ment about the J a p an e se p or n c ar t o on in d ust ry make our English im p ro ve .
If you do n ' t know how to us e bad w or d s , it mean s you c a n ' t c ur se other people , there f or e , you c a n ' t have an ar g u ment with a n at ive speak er .
If you do n ' t know how to de s c ri b e something with st up id express ion s , it mean s you c a n ' t make other people laugh .
So you c a n ' t make a l o c al girl friend and a close friend .
Why do n ' t you become st up id on la ng 8 ?
You re ally want to im p ro ve your English right ?
In for m er days I written about p ri m ar y game .

M an y J a p an e se people who I me t here said , they want to return J a p an , but they do n ' t want to work in J a p an , because it ' s difficult to find a work as same condition as work ing in C an ad a .

On ce they got us ed to work in over se as , it might di f f c ul t to return to J a p an .

I A t ten d ed A L e c ture M e e ting
To day , I at ten d ed a le c ture meeting about teaching of English as an in ter n ation al language .
A p rofessor from the U n ive r s ity of L on d on came to my un ive r s ity as a le c ture r and ga ve a le c ture in English .
As you may know , my ma j or is far from teaching of English .
The reason why I at ten d ed the le c ture meeting was to see how English speak er s made present ation s in a for m al sit u ation and how the a ud i ence asked question s in English .
I le ar n ed so much from the le c ture meeting !
F or ex amp le , I understood that question er s need ed to tell the le c ture r their name and a f f il i ation before as k ing question s .
My te ch n ical present ation class teacher a d v is ed me to at ten d as many le c ture meeting s or con f er ence s as possible before ma k ing my present ation s .
I want to at ten d many le c ture meeting s and con f er ence s !

2 ) It is having t re m en d ous p ow er .
5 ) It is good at the big and d y n a m ic trick s like p un ch , k ic k , s la p . . .
If you know the answer , please commen t it .
It had been dr i z z ling all day here .
The dr i z z le re m in d s me of the de w on the tea - leave s in my home t ow n , then I re m e m b er ed the gr e en tea of my home t ow n .
I favor ite gr e en tea , es pe c i ally I l o ve the s n if f of the gr e en tea in the c up , and I l o ve the me m or ies about tea .
E ver y S p r ing , my m um took my el d er s is ter and me to the tea f i el d s and p ic k ed tea - leave s .
When my m un and my s is ter were bu s y in p ic k ing the tea - leave s , I like to find the b ir d s ' n est s in the tea tree s .
No w , when I am tired , I will make myself a c up of gr e en tea .
A n y way , I l o ve gr e en tea .
What about a dr in k ?
I s l ept over 1 2 hour s to day .
I can not re m e m b er when I had sleep so long last time like to day .
A fter I w o ke up , I went to a T ha i re st a ur ant where a my f re in d works .
I had a To m k a g a i , and a P at th a i there .
Even though I do not like j un k f o o d , j un k f o o d is c he a p and easy to bu y .
So , I ten d ed to eat j un k f o o d s .
A n y way , I just want ed say that I had a good sleep and a de l ic i ous f o o d .
It ' s a long time since I quite d my job .
That mean s I did not us e English for a long time .
But , is that the ex c us e ? ?
One of my friend s begin s to study English , he in d ro d u ce the we b to me .
I s ' t it the long dr e a m of me ? ?
The J a p an e se T e a C er e m on y
To tell you to the tru th , I have any know led g e about the J a p an e se tea ce re m on y because I ' ve never le ar n ed about it .
S in ce I was you ng er , I have n ' t like d both the tea ce re m on y and the J a p an e se f l ow er ar r an g e ment because I do n ' t like we ar ing k im on o .
R i g h t now I ' m re g re t ting about it because I c a n ' t explain anything about them .
I knew that when we had the tea ce re m on y , both of my friend s were very n er ve s .
A ll I could say was follow to other people do ing .
It has long history .
It was ho b b y for them .
To day ' s our p l an was w ar ing J a p an e se ar m or s , but it did n ' t work .
O f course , we can view a very l o ve ly J a p an e se ga r d en .
There are some v ic t im s who s u f f er under po ll u tion .
They work ed in some A m er ic an , J a p an e se or other in ter n ation al comp an ies .
The se fact or ies are not conc er n about en v ir on ment .
They re le a se was te water without proper pro ce s s ing .
That ' s why people get i ll .
M e x ic o go ver n ment est a b l ish ed very str ic t law to pro te c t la b or s and e c o .
The la b or s in M e x ic o do n ' t get proper s al ar ies .
They works in very ter ri ble place s .
The fact or ies b ri d e M e x ic o a u th or it ies .
When C h in a has c he a p er co st of la b or s , fact or ies mo ve there .
What they left in M e x ic o are po ll u tion and dis c ar d ed fact or ies .
The c or r up t a u th or it ies make people s u f f er and to r ture d .
I ho pe the sit u ation will change so bad ly .
S in ce I had take n English class es from j un i or high school to un ive r s ity , f in ally I could have my opinion .
In addition , I am a person who c a n ' t speak and listen to English well too .
Even though in my opinion , my English is better than or d in ar y J a p an e se people , a little b it . . . . .
: ( A n y way , I ' m un s k il led at English still .
Why J a p an e se c a n ' t speak and listen ing to English well ?
F ir st reason is that J a p an is kind a is o la ted .
I mean , No country b or d er s J a p an direct ly .
But when we pass a cross the b or d er s , we have to pass a cross the sea .
So act u ally , J a p an has f e w er for e i g n people than other co un t ri es , which b or d er on some one s .
E s pe c i ally , I can hard ly run a cross those who us e English as their n at ive language ( for ex amp le A m er ic an , B ri t ish and so on ) when I ha ng around a street .
So J a p an e se people do n ' t have an op p or t un ity to run a cross them and co m m un ic ate with them very much .
We do n ' t have a ch ance to be st im ul at ed by for e i g n er s either .
S e c on d reason is that way s of teaching English in J a p an are a little wrong .
: ( In most of J a p an e se English class es , we do n ' t need to listen to English very much , let alone talk in English with class m ate s .
If you were n ' t called on in class , you would n ' t be all ow ed to speak any w or d s ex c ept for cha t ting with your friend .
The ly ri c of a new so ng
This is going to be the ly ri c of my new so ng .
It ' s a re ally short so ng and in v o l v ed with my friend ' s idea .
B e c a us e I could tell my students my thought and feel ing .
I said to them from my heart !
not think ing , just feel .
I do n ' t have a good w or d for explain .
I got off at U en o S t ation to eat my favor ite R ame n , I ch ir an , but it close d .
My girl f ri en d asked me to dinner , but I could n ' t make it , because I had a l ot of work to do to day .
I w or e new business s u it s , but it ra in ed when I went home .
I l o ve language s , in part ic l ar , the sound of English .
It feel like beautiful f l ow of water for me .
But some time s I want to th r ow away everything .
I just only en v y people who is s m ar t .
U m m , sorry , I ' m n a g at ive to day , is n ' t it ?
To day , I return ed my home l ate ly .
It is 1 : 3 0 a m and I ' ll w a ke up at 7 a m in tomorrow morning .
I felt that I need to im p ro ve E ng il s h to l i ten ing and speak ing .
The ch er ry b l o s s o m s come out la ter than usual ,
No w C h er ry tree s are in b l o o m in J a p an .
he ll o to every on e .
This is the first time that I come here .
I wish that I can im p ro ve English day by day , W ish every on e who read this paper had a very n ic e day .
On this day all the people see m ha p p y and ex c it ing .
In this day all the school s , b an k s , go ver n ment office r and many other st or es close to ce le b r at ed .
A l ot of f a m il ies in C an ad a go out d o or p ic n ic s in the p ar k and invite their friend s to sp en d a good time .
they do b ar b e c u e , dance and many f un thing .
P e op le con g re g ate in a particular place with family to watch f i re w or k s .
P e op le enjoy to see the co l or ful and a strong sound .
In C an ad a day all the people have v o c ation they go out side to ce le b r ate .
I think the be st day in C an ad a is C an ad a day because you see all the people we ar re d co l or and ha p p y .
Yes ter day , I finish ed my ex a m which last for two week s f in ally .
It re ally a t ough time since I do n ' t like the sub j e c t that I am study ing .
I am study ing in business which is not the first ch o ic e for me .
O ri g in ally , I think that is great for me to study in this f i el d .
But after this s er v al month s of study , I think I am not a person who ke en on study ing business .
L u c k i ly , I finish ed my ex a m already and I can ce le b r ate C h ri st m as who le he ar t ly
J a p an ' s n ation al so c c er tea m became the ch amp ion at the As i an C up ! ! ! ! ! !
I think you should de c id e and keep the ma in ten ance time on a re g ul ar b as is be c a u es a l ot of people sign up to this sit e l ate ly and you will have to keep the con f i g ul ation simple and clear all the time .
Let ' s say , once a month , may b e on a M on day for three hour s would be con ve n i ent for every on e .
I do n ' t re c o m m en d it on S at ur day , the high time for us er s from the view po in t of c ust o m s er v ic e .
T a ke care of your s el f and than k s always for your great job .
I am p r a c t ic ing l is t n ing to English .
I do n ' t still understand the di f f er ence between `` l `` and `` r `` .
My so n is in the 1 st gra d e of j un i or high school .
He does n ' t finish his s um m er home w or k even though school start s tomorrow ! H is J un i or high give s the students l o ad s of home w or k .
So I ' d told him that he should work on it l it te by little every day from the begin n ing .
D es p ite my a d v ic e , he came to this day . . .
He is draw ing a G un d a m ' s picture for his ar t home w or k now . . .
O f f course , he ' ll not be able to p re p ar e for the t est of the first day a f er the ho l i day . . .
tired to day .
I ar ri v ed at home in the morning because of my b ir th day part y .
I sp en d time with my bo y f ri en d .
He and I at e b ro il ed small in t est in e of c at t le .
And then we cha t ter in the my c ar .
Yes ter day , I was con f us ed about what is c ri t ical think ing because the commen t ; a lack in c ri t ical think ing in J a p an e se education .
`` C ri t ical think ing con s is t s of ment al pro ce s se s of dis c er n ment , an a ly s is and e v al u ation . `` , which is qu or ted by W i k i p ed i a .
In short , in my opinion , c ri t ical think ing mean s that think ing and an a ly z ing by myself in or d er to de c id e what I want to or should do when ever f a c ing with some b ur n ing question s .
However , in J a p an , people still think normal ly of it is polite to f i x their idea s on a con s en s us without str u g g ling against some on e because J a p an is ha r m on y - or i ent ed so c i e ty .
T h us , J a p an e se people , includ ing me , may be poor at do ing c ri t ical think ing .
We ten d to comp ly something like a o b se s s ion of J a p an e se c ust o m s .
T h an k s to this a w ar e ness , I make up my mind to try to put `` c ri t ical think ing `` into p r a c t ic e .
I found this good we b is te and I thought it can help me le ar ng e ng l ish better .
A c t u ally , I ' m not good in English and I ' m afraid of speak ing English . . .
D ur ing my w in ter va c ation , I ' m study ing English and w ri t ting a comp o s i tion s every day .

In j a p an we can get many kind of f r u it .

I have a al ar m clock that I b ough t last year .
The old clock is at o m ic clock , but some time it show s the wrong time .
When it mi s s the w a ve , some time s it show s big wrong time .
The clock is n ' t at o m ic clock and it does n ' t sound of ti c t o c .
It s de s i g h is very good .
Let me in t ro d u ce about me .
My name is J in .
I am 2 6 year s old .
I mo v ed from K or e a to L o s A ng el es in C al if or n i a 3 year s a g o .
I want ed to le ar n English and he al th care .
So it started to study them .
It was better than before but I felt that my language state is not good yet .
A n y way it does n ' t matter because I go n n a try to le ar n them every time s .
A n y body tell me some i nformation how to im p ro ve English s k i ll more f aster .
It take s me to get there more 2 0 hour s from my are a .
It take s me to get to M o s h i from D ar 9 hour s .
When we got to the se le ng e t i c amp sit e , it was 6 o ' clock .
No w , I am work ing for J a p an e se de p ar t ment in my office .
O ur desk s are in next to the A m er ic an de p ar t ment .
I always listen to their English con ver s ation s , but I c a n ' t s i ll understand at all ( w h ite and black people ' s English are very di f f ic ul to understand for s up id J a p an e se ) l o l .
Some time s I o b s er ve other de p ar t ment s d ur ing the d ut y time .
And one of A m er ic an work er s was b ir th day at that time .
They started tak ing p h ot o each other .
O h , if it ' s possible , I want to be b or n in E ur o pe or A m er ic a next my life .
When I live d with my family , my b re a k f a st was ri ch because my mother c ook ed for us .
My mother and s is ter usual ly have b re ad and co f f e e , and my father and I prefer ri ce and mi s o so up .
A t that time , I did n ' t re al i z ed that my mother had to work hard from e ar ly morning to c ook va ri ous f o o d for each .
I re ally a p p re c i ate to my mother .
S t ar ting living by myself , I do n ' t want to take a long time for b re a k f a st , so I eat some f r u it s , so y mi l k , and ce re al or b re ad .
It take s 5 minute s and is done .
Some time s , I mi s s b re a k f a st with my family .
I also mi s s J a p an e se style b re a k f a st .
I would a d d a little so y s a us e and n at t o , too .
E g g s and N at t o are pro te in which comp o se your m us c le .
If you have a ch ance to come to J a p an , please try T K G for your b re a k f a st .
`` D o n ' t as k me about it .
I thought he re ally like s me , but I ble w it ``
I have not st ud i ed it for about four year s , so now I ' m so tired .
not to me , but my be st friend is in p light .
she just heard about some on e s m e ar her be st friend and she told that to friend .
her be st friend got a ng ry when she heard that , so she and
person who s m e ar her had fight .
make s a mistake in this even t .
I want to conc il i ate them .
I study English every day because I want to work at for e i g n country .
But it ' s difficult to do it in my comp an y , so my comp an y has no bra n ch es in for e i g n country . . .
I like my job in my comp an y , and my bo s s give me prais e .
But . . . while I am work ing in my comp an y , I think that I c a n ' t go a b ro ad on business .
So I p l an to change comp an y , but I am he s it at ing .
But may b e I will change comp an y , and I will be in for e i g n country in a f e w year s !
If you feel interest , please go to her and help her also .
There is so ver n al f r a g r ance here , S en d a i where I ' m living , to day .
We have been feel ing s c ar ed now a day s because of the e ar th qu a ke , but that would w ar n up our heart a little .
I re ally ho pe to have `` O h an a m i `` , eat ing and dr in k ing something to g e ther with my friend s , when the ch er ry b l o s s o m s in this c ity will be full y b l o ome d .
F or ex amp le , we present something each other , dr in k , and eat c a ke on the C h ri st m as day and ch il d re n believe in S ant a C la us .
J a p an e se people are very good at im p or t other c ul ture s .
A l m o st all of J a p an e se enjoy C h ri st m as but J a p an e se C h ri st i an s are only 1 . 2 % of the p op ul ation .
M or e o ver J a p an e se C h ri st m as has no re l ation to re l i g ion .
It los t d ur ing in p or ting .
Why J a p an e se people have been im p or ting C h ri st m as , is because J a p an e se people are f un of We s ter n c ul ture s .
F or this year s we have been im p or ting H a ll ow e en .
I finish ed pack ing to go to T a i w an .
is 5 : 3 0 A M , but c or re c t time is 4 : 3 0 A M ( not 5 : 3 0 A M ) .
It is difficult for me to f a ll as le e p soon the day before the tri p
T h ough it does not a ch e all the time , I feel so re when I eat something hot .
It seemed to be get ting better , but I a c c id ent ally b it ed the so re part and made it w or se .
It become s better , I b ite it , s w e ll s and a ch es again , gradua l ly sub s id ed , then I . . .
I went sh op p ing yesterday and b ough t some stuff s such as b a c on and eggs .
I do n ' t want to pay for it , so I re f us ed it .
A fter sh op p ing , I tri ed to come back home .
Then , I saw a bu s coming , then I de c id ed to run .
As you gue s s , it was when the eggs were b ro k en inside my r u c k s a c k .
When I open ed my b a g and saw l i qu id of e g g sp re ad .
No w , the e g g dr i ed in my b a g , it see m s like se m en .
And if some on e saw it and think it is that , it ' s a sh ame .
What I want to insist is I have never tri ed se m en in r u c k s a c k before .
I listen to the r ock ' n ' ro ll and the dance m us ic in the morning .
B e c a us e I want to listen the r h y th m ical m us ic in the morning .
My favor ite m us ic i an is M ic ha el J a c k s on , and B e at le s .

E s pe c i ally , I like en y a .
It re la x es very much .
This is first time to us e L an g 8 at school .
I thought we are not all ow ed to us e this we b s ite because we ' re not all ow ed to us e face b ook and I thought it ' s kind a same .
But it was wrong , I can us e it ! !

I was do ing s k y pe this morning with my family in J a p an and I a little mi s s th w m .

To day I p r a c t ic ed c ar d trick .
And I make c ar d trick ro ut in e .

But I mistake c ar d trick .

But one m or e time .
I was success .
To day is S at , so I have no school .
I was read ing b ook s in all day .
I read `` The S ha d ow O ver In n s m o u th `` after a long time .
I re m e m b er , I had a night m ar e for read it in one ' s ch il d h o o d .
My first day with a for e i g n f ir en d on in ter ne t
It is quite ex c it ing for me to con ta c t with people who is different from my co un ty .
I have always been dr e a m ing to make friend s around the world .
To day , I made my first s te p .
I knew a J a p an e se us er on la ng - 8 .
T h an k s to the g l o b l i z ation , which made a T a i w an e se and a J a p an e se can cha t in English , we can co m m un ic ate on in ter ne t though we speak different mother to n gue .
B e en st ud i ed in A ust r al i a , his English is pretty good .
A f r a id of off en se , I was very n er v ous at first .
However , his friend ly gr e e ting to me re l i e ve my n er v ous ness so much .
I think it is a good start .
I ho pe I can make more for e i g n friend s .
I go to watch a `` B l u e man `` show in Tokyo J a p an on S at ur day .
A fter the show I have a dinner with my co ll e a gue s at a hotel .
U s u ally I dr in k a S a ke or al c o h o l at the dinner .
But this time I re f r a in it .
B e c a us e no body dr in k it ex c ept me .
How do you think ?

Some time s , I am able to he ar the voice from other people .
One day , I te le p h on ed my friend , when I ha ng off the te le p h on e , I he ar something .
My friend ' s voice .
strange ex pe ri ence .
Then , I te le p h on ed my friend again and asked her whether she told that , to my surprise , I am right .
My favor ite a u th or is D an B r ow n , he is g en i us .
U n f or t un ate ly , I just read two no ve l s of his no ve l s .
They are ' The D a v in c i C o d e ' and ' The L o st S y m b o l ' .
I like The los t S y m b o l more than The D a v in c i C o d e .
While I was read ing many things surprise d me .
The L o st S y m b o l is the be st no ve l I ever read , and I suggest every on e to read it .
W as te of time
I will go sh op p ing or sleep .
D o you know where S h i man e p re f e c ture is ?
It is we st J a p an , and near est place to So u th K or e a .
I live d from 2 0 0 1 to 2 0 0 3 for business .
I had many ex pe ri ence , for ex amp le ha p p y and un ha p p y .
It made me gr ow ing up .
She is a person who s up p or ted me .
L ook ing back on my past ent ri es , I ' m pretty s ur p ir s ed how ho r ri b el my English was and , at the same time , ha p p y to see im p ro ve ment s in myself .
I ' m not a co ll e g e st ud ent , work ing hard every day and some time s us ing English .
The be l ow is my de s c ri p tion that I made for this pro d u c t but would be a w es ome if you could c or re c t them the way that it sound s more natural and may b e hu m or ous .
S t ar ting from this c u b e in the bo x , which is comp o s ed of ti n y little ma g n etic b a ll s , you can c re ate mi ll ion s of different object s just like how it is show n in the v id e o be l ow
I have sp ent so much money ever since I started sh ar ing it e m s here at F l ut ter S c a pe ha ha ha Tokyo is a w es ome !
I had two reason for r ent this D V D .
I re c ome n d this mo v i e .
C o m po s i tion 0 7 2 0 , please help me c or re c t it or provide me some idea s , than k s ! !
It is of ten not a good thing to mo ve to a new c ity or a new country because of the los ing of old friend s .
A number of people ma in tain that it is dis ad v ant age ous to mo ve to a new c ity or a new country d u e to the los ing old friend s .
While the first re a ction of some people may be to agree with this state ment , there are comp el ling reason s to ex p l or e it more in de p th .
As I see it , mo v ing to a new c ity make s me str e ng th en my friend s h i p and b ro ad en my ho ri z on .
F ir st and for e m o st , mo v ing to a new c ity make me own op p or t un it ies to show my old friend s how m ul t ic ul t ur al and va ri ous the new c ity is .
T a ke my own ex pe ri ence for ex amp le .
B e c a us e living in a new c ity , I was able to invite my friend s to visit an interest ing c ity .
I had ch ance s to become a to ur g u id e to show them around a new c ity , T a i pe i .
T a k ing them to the place which is beautiful and they did not have ch ance s to visit would str e ng th en our friend s h i p and make them have a good time .
With o ut mo v ing to a new c ity , I could not have op p or t un it ies to sha re in no v at ive things with them .
There f or e , it is be ne f ic i al for me to mo ve to a new c ity or country .
M or e o ver , I would be ne f it from living in a c ity which I have never go ne .
I would b ro ad en my ho ri z on in a new en v ir on ment .
I made a number of new friend s who have different c ul ture and back g r ound .
I was also able to go to the m us e um s or ex h i b i tion s to im p ro ve my understand ing of c ust o m , c ul ture , and history of a new c ity , which could also re f in e my ta s te for ar t .
Besides , I could go to the un ive r s ity by M R T rather than b ic y c le since there is con ve n i ent public tra n s p or t ation s y s te m in T a i pe i .
On the con t r ar y , if I did not go to a place I never go , I have no idea about what a de ve l op ed c ity it is .
C on se qu ent ly , living in a new c ity make s my e y e open and c re ate more op p or t un it ies for me .
In conc l us ion , not only mo v ing to a new c ity can str e ng th en my friend s h i p , but it also make s me know this world .
There are a number of a d v ant age s for me to go to new circumstance s .
However , I feel con f id ent that the reason s I have me n tion ed a b o ve in favor of my point of view are strong er .
I have p u b l ish ed a number of very short j o ur n al s as if we us e T w it ter .
If you access follow ing my we b p age on T w it ter , you can understand what I ' m writing about .
D o n ' t look back , never .
L if e time is short .
P er s on ' s life is give out .
E ver y body know s .
The he d g e h o g is a kind of an im al with th or n y s ur f a ce and tender in ter n al .
The two le ad s in this b ook are both fond of so l it ar i ness and re f u g e from other s and themselves like the he d g e h o g s .
T h r ough funny and hu m or ous style of writing , the write r in f er s some question s w or th y of think ing from co m m on place life .
It ' s a b ook about p h il o s op h ical think ing .
I do n ' t understand what it say s at the first read ing .
But the second time , I just dis c o ver it s interest .
In such a so c i e ty where every on e is like a he d g e h o g , how do we keep gentle ?
U n d er the c ul t ur al di f f er ence and id ent if ic ation , the le ad p ur s u es the mean ing of her ex is t ence all the time .
There is a l ot of de s p a ir in life , but the beautiful time also ex is t s , that is a for ever life .
I ' m b or ing now .
so I am very b or ing .
The us e of c l ut ch
I have a question conc er n ing the us e of `` c l ut ch `` .
When I watch a b a se b a ll game in ma j or le a gue b a se b a ll ,
I of ten he ar `` a c l ut ch hi t ter `` or `` a c l ut ch p it ch er `` .
In this con te x t , a w or d , `` c l ut ch `` f un ction s as an a d j e c t ive in or d er to de s c i b e
the some on e that is strong es pe c i ally when he or she is having a
c a p it al ch ance , right ?
`` If I qu it the job , do n ' t you feel mi s s me ? ``
I ga z ed at him for f e w second s with s us p ic i ous e y e .
He looked e m b ar r as s ed with sh y ly smile . `` . . .
But I ' ll for g e t what I said to day because I ' m st up id . `` con t in u ed to say .
When I got the train and had a sea t , tea r s were run n ing through my face .
`` You told me you do n ' t mi s s me even if I leave here ?
I be l ive d what you said comp le te ly at that time . . . `` I thought in my mind .
I always want his w or d s but he ' s not good at saying his thought .
It e a i ly le ad s mi s un d er st and ing each other though , when small things that I not ic e every s ing le day comp i le my heart , they turn out my hu m ble wish es .
I felt like something f il led e m p ty inside .
I saw mo v i e ' L if e I s B e a ut i ful ' .
I c a n ' t for g e t it d ur ing my who le life time .
The mo v i e con t ent s is in the J e w s l aught er age .
A J e w man me t a pretty w ome n and they were l o ve with each other .
So they are mar ri ed and they have a so n .
But G er man ar m y took s there and they were im p ri s on ed the H o l o c a ust .
But father was try to keep his so n .
He does n ' t los e his laugh ter , w it .
He lie d to his so n .
He said `` This is game .
We will try to w in on this game .
We will get 1 0 0 0 point so we will get tank . `` In the end , the father success es keep to so n .
But he di ed .
I think he is good father to his so n .
If they were in the w or st sit u ation that he was try to be c he er ful people for his so n .
My sit u ation is not w or st .
So I will try to be b ri g h t people .
D o you like tra ve l ( at least tra ve l on on line ) .

D r a g on B a ll is a very interest ing A n im e .
But I have not watch ed re c ent ly D r a g on B a ll mo v i e yet .
If time is enough , I watch it .
I look ing for w ar d to watch it ! ! ! !
We c ome back , ro b in !
My hu s b and and I just had a talk about a b ir d n est yesterday .
We have an a p p le tree in our back y ar d which a bra ce of A m er ic an ro b in n est ed and la id eggs the year before last .
We looked for w ad to see ing the bra ce ra is ing a b ro o d .
But un f or t un ate ly their eggs did n ' t ha t ch , and they dis c ar d ed the n est .
A n un h at ch ed b l u e e g g left behind in the n est , and one was c r a c k ed on the gr ound .
L a st year , no b ir d n est ed to the tree .
M a y b e my hu s b and had c ut back bra n ch es so short that they were not s u it able to make a n est .
I look the n est from the side w al k so that I do n ' t s c ar e the n est - own er s .
I ho pe that I can he ar ch ir p of b ro o d from the n est .
And I some time get er r or s which is line in the display .
I have already been us ing for 3 year s .
I ' m still think ing that whether or not I will bu y new one .
If I will bu y it , I want a came r a which is able to take in dark place .
He a v y C o l d
I ' ve got a he a ve co l d last week .
A t first , my no se is run n ing and I can not help s ne e z ing .
Then one night , I felt my no se was to t ally stop p ing up , I could not b re a th at all !
I can not get in sleep .
No w my head is di z z y and my he ar ing is poor .
When people talk to me the voice is like 3 0 mi le s away from me .
It sen se like a piece of paper co ver ing my e ar when I am he ar ing .
I am a poor p at i ent now .
I ha te to have co l d .
My no se is still stop p ing up when I ty p ing the se w or d s down .
I wish I can get better soon .
I have lack ed the mo t i v ation to write an ent ry .
So , I do only c or re ction for the present .
I just stay at home , do some home w or k on house de c or ation , I will de c or ate my house in O c t o b er .
But when I a c c id ent ly found this place , I said W ow .
To day I have l ot s of work to do , p re p ar e the re p or t for my bo s s and also the house de c or ation .
I think it ' s time to have a job ho p p ing , for do ing work in week en d is n ' t re ally what I can stand .
I ' am p re p ar ing the in t ro d u ction for my ter m paper at B ri t ish history .
But I am afraid that I have a l ot of mistake s . .
The H is t or y of E ng l and is very pro f ound and many - side d .
It to t al s a hu g e number of even t s and the person s , who any h ow in f l u ence d it .
In each e po ch there were ke y moment s and f i g ur es about which it is possible to read a l ot of the interest ing .
I consider that one of the most am b i g u ous f i g ur es of English history is the re p re s ent at ive of the T ud or d y n as ty , d aught er of k ing He n ry V I I - M ar i a the F ir st or as she is also name d - B l o o d y M ar y .
This name is still sh ro ud ed by set of se c re t s and le g en d s .
There are no mo n u ment s put in her home l and , people as s o c i ate the per i o d of her re i g n with b l o o d y ma s s a c re s ; day of her de a th ( and s im ul ta ne ous ly day of access ion to the th ro ne E l i z a b e th I ) was mar k ed in the country as a n ation al ho l i day .
We see the picture g l o o m y enough , but it has in v o l v ed me in this his t or ic f i g ur e .
H aving read about the qu e en at a history less on , I have started to sea r ch for the every possible i nformation about her , to read va ri ous b ook s , to see the f il m s con ne c ted with her person al ity .
When I have looked an English se ri al `` T ud or s `` , about this great d y n as ty , I became as s ur ed that my ter m paper will be about M ar i a .
I want ed to le ar n more about this strange , f an at ical qu e en who has do ome d to de a th a large qu ant ity in no c ent people .
In my work I have tri ed to tra c k M ar i a ' s life from a b ir th , to the de a th .
I have co ll e c ted every possible le g en d s con ne c ted with her and the fact s of her b i o g r a p h y which pro ve that this person was his t or ical and that it is not e w or th y .
In R o man s 8 : 8 side `` So then they that are in the f le s h can not please G o d . `` We make de c is ion s every day .
I s it from my f le s h or J es us ' will .
My face must look s like the dark c l o ud s .
It ' s like that P e ter walk ed on the sea to J es us .
If I look around the world and not f o c us on J es us , my f le s h will be act i v at ed .
However , our L or d is so good , He s a v ed P e ter before he s un k .
A d j ust our at t it ud e .
G u id e us .
I have no idea what can I say .
I ho pe my E ng ish comp o s i tion can be better
I ho pe when I writing the them e of E c on o m ic s & A c c o un ting , do n ' t have the same mistake or don t have a l ot of mistake . . . .
I ho pe be a better girl
I ho pe I can have more idea l of my own .
I ho pe I can do ever e y th ing by myself be a strong girl
which can come tru e ? ?
How hard I ll done a b o ve ?
I need some on e s up p or t me
I los t , con f us ed about myself , my future . . .
Ka r a o ke part y at to night !
S or ry , I c a n ' t w ir te English well to night because I ' m dr un k and
We only have 2 hour s in E aster ho l i day . . .
I wish play pai n b a ll next ho l i day . .
I was work ing hard for one week to p re p ar e my talk present ation .
F ir st of all , I had to work a l ot to p re p ar e da ta for the talk .
I p re p ar ed P ow er P o in t s l id es by yesterday mi d night .
I m look ing for some on e who is a `` n at ive `` English speak er and le ar n s j a p an e se .
any way leave me a commen t if ur interest ed in ~
I ' m not good at co l d we a ther .
I do n ' t us e an um b re ll a every day .
be c ous e my house with near sea .
and w in d is very hard .
I will need many um b re ll a .
No w , I live at gue st house which is f ur n it ur ed .
But , I will mo ve to a new big g er a p ar t ment from S ept e m b er , because my family will come to G er man y from J a p an at No ve m b er .
In ter est ing ly , when G er man mo ve out , they b r ing all the things in their room , includ ing k it ch en , e le c t ri c bu l b and bath .
So , new room is just e m p ty !
I have to bu y everything in it i ally .
This s y s te m is better for person to make a their own room , but is not good for tra n s i ent re s id ent s like us .
I wonder how much it co st to bu y f ur n i ture , electronic e qu i p t ment , , , .
My friend s call me H ar u .
I usual ly leave home at ten th ity .
There is much ra in tomorrow .
I had a on line English speak ing train ing at R ar e J o b to day , but there were some pro ble m s .
I could not listen to teacher ' s voice some time s , and s ud d en ly the S k y pe con ne ction b ro ke .
Some people w ro te about R ar e j o b ' s S k y pe con ne ction on their b l o g s .
One of them w ro te that `` I co ll e c t teachers who have an good In ter ne t con ne ction , and I have a less on with them every time . ``
I re al i z ed that it was a good a d v ic e , and I ' ll do so .
My class ma te s
I have a two be st friend s in my class .
They make me f un every time .
In that case , please tell me about your friend .
And sha ll we become a friend .
T h an k you for watch ing . . .
My 1 4 month s old so n
J ust after b ir th , I did ' t feel I ' m ha p p y with a b a b y because I could n ' t sleep at all .
But time was a c ur e .
language is one of co re of comp e t i tion
T ir ed of tra n s l ate for m C h in e se from English , I ' m w ri t ting e ng l ish di ar y im m ed i ate ly in here .
I understood my e ng l ish very poor , but I re a ly like le ar n it .
C ur r ent ly , g l o b al bu s h i ness has been dr ive n by la ng r ly comp e t i tion , in my opinion language is one of co re of comp e t i tion , es pe c i ally English is very im p or t ant in work and study .
I am 1 5 , study ing in F . 3 .
I live in a small c ity , M a c a u , which is one of the S A R s of C h in a .
A p ar t from English , I am also le ar n ing J a p an e se because of J a p an e se an im ation s and m us ic s .
But re c ent ly I f o c us on J a p an e se too much that I have ne g le c ted the English study .
So I de c id ed to re s um e my study by writing di ar i y here .
Some time s I b l ame myself for why I have le ar n t English for around 1 0 year s but still c a n ' t re a ch a high stand ar d .
I am very we a k at listen ing and have got only a narrow ra ng e of v o c a b ul ar y .
O f course writing is one of the we a k ness es as well .
So I ho pe I can re ally im p ro ve my English on this sit e .
A t least to start with writing first .
the day before yesterday I saw my c ous in us e some ex ten s ion ha ir . . .
and I as k her for the ha ir . . .

then she said just R p 4 . 0 0 0 . . .

I want it too ! !
can you please bu y me for some co l o ur ?
' ' o k a y . . , I will as k first with my friend ^ ^ ' ' she re p l i ed me
in my mind . . , I want this five co l o ur . . .

she sen d me some me s s age . .
said the co l o ur that I want just re d and p ur p le . . . ,
I ' ve began an in ter v i e w pro ce s s to he ar a p ot ent i al us er opinion direct ly to day .
I ' m w or ri ed about whether there are a person who want to me e t me for get my a p p s i nformation .

B y re st the day I take d the me d ic in e and day after in the morning I felt better , so I de c id ed to go to work .
There ti ll 1 2 o ' clock was more or less good , but la ter again I felt we a k .
To day and tomorrow too I took free again d u e even I in f e c t my i ll ness to other people ' s , then would be a pro ble m cause who le comp an y would be close d .
C ur r ent ly I ' m feel ing better , all the day I sp en d ing my time in the be d and he al up .
I ho pe ma x im um after tomorrow I ' m going to be he al ed .
I like listen ing English po d c a st s very much .
It ' s free and there are many interest ing i nformation s in it .
It con s is t s all English , so it help s you to think in English .
E s pe c i ally , I re c o m m en d w or d s explanation of B e g in n er L es s on which explain s w or d ' s mean ing s in simple English .
I went to s us h i re st a ur ant with my p ar ent s

I do n ' t like was a b i because I would c ry if I eat m us h was a b i .
I know the most of the for e i g n er s does n ' t like was a b i too .
D o es for e i g n er s say to be J a p an e se ho r s er ad ish ?
I am a 1 st gra d e un ive r s ity students in J a p an : K y us h u un ive r s ity .
E ver y on e who are study ing J a p an e se , let ' s talk with me !
My favor ite for e i g n c ul ture s are s im p s on s , o as is ( s ing er ) ,
I went to D al la s with my friend s for 4 night s , 5 days after I finish ed my s um m er class es .
I though they would fight but they would not ; they show ed j ud g es the K un g - F u for m s and the j ud g es gra d ed their perform ance s .
We stay ed at my friend ' s a un t ' s house and they have 4 kid s and we have 4 kid s with us and I le ar n ed that kid s like a person that pay s the most at ten tion to them .
Well , it was about my ro ad tri p .
I am going to make a new ent ry when I come up with the to p ic .
One of my dr e a m .
I go to there since last year .
I ' m not a b s ent from there .
But I do n ' t almost study in my home .
So I ' m not good at talk ing English .
I try to study in my home every day from now on .
And I want to talk English s m o o th ly .
It ' s one of my dr e a m .
To m or r ow , it ' s black F ri day .
It ' s good for people , but my am er ic an friend s said `` I w o n ' t go there because every on e go there and pack ed .
I started to us e L an g - 8 from to day , the first day in 2 0 1 1 .
I stay ed in E ng l and for a month up to two day before the C h ri st m as e ve in 2 0 1 0 , which was the first v is ting in a for e i g n country for me .
That stay ing made me re c o g n i z e that co m m un ic ation to other s , es pe c ic ally people not only J a p an e se , is very f un .
S in ce my English is very poor , I was not able to talk to l ot s of English people .
B y us ing L an g - 8 , I would like to im p ro ve my English s k i ll and get a friend s around the world .
- in K or e a ( While the ho st is not even think ing of g i v ing the c a ke s , the gue st dr in k s the k im ch i j u ic e first . )
So c c er is more f a m ous than b a se b a ll .
So c c er b a ll is big g er than b a se b a ll .
B a se b a ll is hard er than So c c er b a ll .
B a se b a ll is as p op ul ar as So c c er .
B a se b a ll game is as well as So c c er game .
So c c er run s as f a st as b a se b a ll .
S e v ar al month s a g o , I went to M on tain T a i with a friend of mi ne and her mother .
she live d in sh and on g province , so I went to her home first and visit her mother .
after re st for a f e w days , we set out on the j o ur ne y .
M o un tain T a i is a f a m ous to ur is t re s or t .
as soon as we ar ri v ed , we dr e w a de ta il ed p l an .
and de c id ed c l im b up at 7 o ' clock p m .
so , we could ar ri v ed mo un tain t op before s un ri se .
M o un tain T a i is f a m ous for it ' s s un ri se , but not every on e ar ri v ed here could saw it as we a ther fact or .
so l u k y we are ! we saw it .
I took l ot s of p h ot o es .
It ' s a very good j o ur ne y .
It ' s the 3 r d less on I take , I want to le ar n how to s ing ing .
But some time s I re ally ho pe I can enjoy s ing ing like other s does .
This m us ic class my do me some good , but I am not sure .
B e c a us e last time we s ing a sen t ence for the first time .
O ur home w or k is le ar n a so ng and s ing in to night ' s class .
Then I will found if I have le ar n ed s ing ing .
P ro b ably , the te m p er a ture was under 1 0 de g re es .
But I re ally feel ha p p y as I heard the mo t or c y c le ' s e ng in e sound in front of my s al on .
It was Ka w as a k i , which has a ma s c u line im age .
He took a mo t or b i ke to ur in H o k k a id o this s um m er , he almost run around in H o k k a id o .
I have went to there on my mo t or c y c le to H o k k a id o long a g o too , but I have n ' t run around there yet .
H is story made me ha p p y and in s p ir ed me to do same thing .
S t ud y ing for ex a m s is very very interest ing .
The se are good for me d u e to having a l ot of know led g e of business .
E s pe c i ally , account ing is great because the se ent er tain me and give us e ful know led g e .
Then , let ' s start study ing again .
A f e w month a g o , I went to U en o Z o o .
U en o is l o c at ed in Tokyo J a p an .
I want ed to see two p and as .
When I saw p and as , one p and a eat ing bamboo gra s s ; another one it sleep ing .
A p and a is very c ut e an im al .
I l o ve it .
But when we see a p and a , it is ne ce s s ar y to stand in a line at long time s .
I do n ' t like it .
B e c a us e I get tired .
Yes ter day was ra in ed ho le day .
I like ra in y day .
I do n ' t know why but I just like that sound .
I s there something to eat on a ra in y day in other country .
In k or e a eat bu ch im g a e on a ra in y day .
but our f a m il ly have n ' t had bu ch im g a e .
How come s we for g ot about that .
In s te ad we at e ch ic k en watch ing the world c up .

So in this even ing , I eat out with my friend .

To tell the tru th , she is a v o c al s y n th es i z er .
No t only pro s ing er s , but also am ate ur can c re ate their own m us ic .
Some people s an g those v o c al o id ' s so ng s and made their de b ut as pro s ing er s .
I think it is interest ing that any on e make sound , any on e make ly ri c s and any on e make H A T S U N E M i ku s ing .
T h an k s to her , we got va ri ous way s of enjoy ing m us ic .
F or ex amp le , `` K A I T O `` is one of the v o c al o id s which s ing in man ' s voice .
I want to try to c re ate my own m us ic some day .

My friend just leave me so now I have no one to talk : ( ha ha sound s s ad but not to much . . .
[ What interest ed you l i b r ar ies and i nformation s c i ence ]
A c t u ally , I a c c id ent ally ent er this de p ar t ment .
Then I saw this de p ar t ment and I was n ' t sure about what this is going to le ar n , but I thought this might do something with comp ut er which I ' m quite interest ed in , so I de c id e to give it a try .
I got p l ent y of things I like to do , like draw ing , de s i g n ing some hand ic r a f t s , s ing ing , b a k ing , play ing v o ll e y b a ll , listen ing to m us ic , e t c .

He has had p la st ic s ur g er y many time s has change d his own face , an d had kept run n ing away for near ly 3 year s .
I heard that his both p ar ent s are do c t or , he was s m ar t was in great co ll e g e .
So I thought he may b e had a l ot of p re s s ur e , and that might be re la ted to this affair .
I think that ' s one thing we must n ' t do ever .
I thought he might be re l i e v ed that he was ar re st ed .
I read a new s about this on the in ter ne t , it said some on e say s he is a good look ing .
I feel re ally sorry for a v ic t im ; a l o ve ly B ri t ish woman , her family and also for a m ur d er er ' s family .
I wish the world piece without ho r ri ble m ur d er s like this , dis aster s and all bad matter s ! .
While I am talk ing with my co w or k er to day , I see m that I am just see ing about my co w or k er .
I tri ed change d my f o c us that I look at see my feel ing s ever al time .
A ll my co w or k er s kind ly to me so it is most ly ha p p y when I do work .
I want be honest about my feel ing .
And then I am always feel ing ha p p y .
My c l in ic do n ' t have a l ot of p at i ent .
But once some p at i ent come in , they also talk ed about them live s so I also ti n y talk s about my feel ing .
It is f un .
E ver y thing is ha p p y to day .
I ' ve got p re m i um me m b er
I ' m new co m m er .
T h ough I visit ed la ng - 8 sit e only a f e w days a g o , I l o ve la ng - 8 .
I gue s s the comp an y which run this sit e need s c ash .
So I ' ve de c id ed to pay for p re m i um me m b er .
I ho pe the comp an y will gr ow up like face b ook .
Some time s I had many day d re a m and d ur ing day d re a m there are many r and o m things in my head , I feel some time s I want to me e t all my friend s in the past and think that now is very im po s s i ble to do that : (
and I know s that it ' s past time and this time they are bu s y w h it there act i v ity : 9 how s ad is it and se p ar at ed each other .
This is life re al ity : / bad things and good things is become me m or ies in my head
act u ally I could see about over 5 0 0 pe op le yesterday .
it was just beautiful . we s an g for go d heart ful y .
B as ed on my ex pe ri ence , those saying J a p an e se is easy to m aster usual ly turn out not to have a s u f f ic i ent command of the language .
To day ' s op p on ent is the most strong tea m in my are a ' s co ll e g e .
I will be my be st .
To day , I could n ' t be mo t i v at ed for anything .
My school class start s in next week .
I thought that al th ough my mind did n ' t yet want to go to school , my so ul or my body might do .
W he ther I ho pe or not , the time is ne ce s s ar i ly coming .
We stay there for about a week .
We do not s w im in the o ce an .
R e ad b ook s , listen ing m us ic and for g e t da i ly life in J a p an .
I do n ' t know much about P h il i p p in es but try to find something new to me .
I ho pe I have a good co m m un ic ation with l o c o people .
When I went back to J a p an and had another tri p to Ka g o s h im a , So u ther n part of J a p an , I asked for that f r u it .
But I c a n ' t find them and asked whether I could find it in the s up er m ar ke t .
No one said they never saw R a m b ut an no r heard the name .
A c t u ally , ra m b ut an is pro h i b it ed to gr ow in J a p an .
for some on s al es it e m s that can be us e in my study are a .
I want to c re ate an co f f e e sh op like en v ir on ment .
I always enjoy to study in S t ar st r u c k or P an er a C a f e .
L a st year s I brought some $ 2 P a in ting s and one $ 2 0 s tain less s in k and some very good qu al ity t able s to p only $ 5 each .
Some day , I will go to N Y to see her .
this is one of my dr e a m s .
M an y do ll s is display ed on a ti er ed stand for do ll s .
I like five m us ic i an do ll s name d ` go n in - b a y ash i ` .
they play f l ut e , dr um , hand dr um , go ng .
And one of them s ing s a so ng .
To day I did play ing y ut con t est in the ch ur ch .
I feel ing good .
To who ever read this stuff
I was n ' t sleep ing while class es .
and back home , I at e one - p ot dis h c ook ed at the t able .
A fter I went to the English c r a m school .
Some of them are re ally wonder ful , however , some P o d c a st s is hard to understand for me .
I need to listen many time s before I could catch on them without the le ar n ing g u id es .
So I get a idea here , I ' ll tra n s l ate the con t ent f a m ous English P o d c a st into C h in e se , le ar n ing by this pro ce s s and sha re with all of you guy s !
P le a se help me c or re c t my mistake .
However , from now on , I de c id ed to write my da i ly ro ut in es in this we b s ite f re qu ent ly to im p ro ve and p r a c t ic e my e ng l ish writing s k i ll s .
When I was a ch il d , my dr e a m was to live with a do g .
If he stand s up , his he i g h is same as me .
When I go back home , I say `` he ll o , I ' m home ! `` .
Then the do g come for me with his ta il w a g g ing .
B e c a us e I have a job , I do n ' t have any con f id ence to take care of a p up p y .
However I read some do g ma g a z in es and I im a g in e to live with a do g .
No w , I want to have We l s h C or g i !
We need English as off ic i al language ?
They think if they con t in u e to us e J a p an e se as off ic i al language , they c a n ' t e m p l o y over se as people that c a n ' t speak J a p an e se but have ex ce ll ent s k i ll s .
F ur ther m or e , R a ku ten in ten d s to s a c k the c or p or ate office r s if they will not le ar n English unti l two year s la ter .
The e m p l o y e es that c a n ' t us e English also will be re d u c ed .
I heard that now they us e English at meeting s even though all at ten d e es are J a p an e se .
Some J a p an e se b l o g g er s say that it ' s the ex ce ll ent de c is ion because J a p an e se e m p l o y e es will be able to co m m un ic ate with over se as e m p l o y e es and c ust ome r s more easily than before if they will le ar n English .
U s u ally over se as people can understand English even if they ' re not from English - speak ing co un t ri es .
On the other hand s , there are people that c ri t ic i z e it .
Even the e m p l o y e es that have high English s k i ll s c a n ' t con ve y de ta il ed intention s in English as well as in J a p an e se .
J a p an e se e m p l o y e e will not be able to co m m un ic ate well each other .
It will b r ing a d ver se effect .
I to t ally agree an opinion that English is im p or t ant for co m m un ic ation .
How do you think about it ?
A st ud ent c he at ed on K y ot o un ive r s ity ' s entrance ex a m s .
M e an w h i le , it at t r a c ted con t ro ver s y in K y ot o un ive r s ity ' s and the me d i a ' s a ction s .
Some people re p ro a ch not only the st ud ent but also the a ction s .
My English teacher told me this we b sit e , and I try to write
I took my English teacher ' s less on to day , but it was his last less on ,
because he will come back to his country next M on day .
I ' m a re s id ent do c t or in J a p an , and last night I work ed at e m er g en c y
room all over the night .
This day time I have to keep work ing
he ll o , every on e .
I am new here .
I want to le ar n e ng l ish well .

I must le ar n English , but e v ry on e know my le ve l is too l ow .
When I was a j un i o ur high school st ud ent , English class teacher la g h ed at me , because m y pro n un c i ation was un i qu e for him .
E ver y day I ' m very bu s y at life and job .
On ly I study a for e i g n language , I feel ha p p y .
G o o d speak er may b e is not good w or k er .
I am not a good w or k er , always I had some mi s s .
I took my so n s to a ha ir c ut s al on this morning , and then went to a one co in sh op D a is o .
My 2 - year - old so n like to have him he l d in my ar m s .
I usual ly say to him , `` Let ' s walk with your own f o ot . `` , but he return s to me , `` H o l d me in your ar m s , please ! ``
B e c a us e he for g a v ed to bu y his favor ite s n a c k .
I me t a bo y on ne t last night .
And cha t with him for about one hour .
He is work ing in us a .
and he told me that my e ng l ish is more f l u ent and better than his co w or k er s who came from ch in a .
M an y of them have work ed and live d there so long time , But their e ng l ish is just so - so .
It is funny .
ho pe I can live in other pro v i ence or c ity .
M an y J a p an e se people will go to the sh ri ne when b a b ies become 1 month old .
It call s `` O m i y a m a i ri `` .
This purpose is than k s to b or n he al th y and b a b ies will gr ow up he al th y .
When we will go to `` O m i y a m a i ri `` , b a b ies we ar k im on o .
I have n ' t had a di ar y , s ud d en ly want ed to write to day ,
It ' s fine day !
It is very n ic e day in Tokyo .
but It is a little co l d .
M an y people in trouble is far from here in the affect ed are as .
What can I do .
I wish I s a ve p ow er .
I want to help for help less .
I want to give to ho pe for ho pe less .
C an You do anything .
I d ropped my i po d to u ch in to i le t b ow l last week and it went down .
On ly three month s a g o I b ough t it , but in this case the trouble was cause d by water , thus it was out of g u ar ant e e .
It was p ity .
A trouble by water c a n ' t be f i x ed , so I ex change the i po d to u ch for new one at A p p le st or e .
It co st s me 2 0 0 0 0 y en ( about 2 0 0 do ll ar s ) to ex change , which is half a p ri ce of new one .
I want A p p le to make water p ro o f i po d .
When I was a ch il d here in J a p an , there ' s no gr ound ing , which last s for a per i o d .
I re m e m b er I was c ry ing and bu m p ing to the do or .
To day , I went to O d a i b a in Tokyo with my friend by his c ar .
U n f or t un ate ly , to day is so w in d y ; it ' s a b it hard for us to walk .
The pro ble m is being out of b re a th . ( v v ; )
How can I write a n ic e person al state ment ?
T e a ch er a k s ed us to write a person al state ment , and she show ed us some ex amp le s in which there are va ri ous tra g ed ies such as p ar ent di v or ce , serious i ll ness and c ar a c c id ne t .
We a d op ted a p us s y c at
We he ar c at ' s c ry ing when we were walk ing and come to see that .
When we see this pretty little c at we could n ' t left it alone .
He is g ing er and w h ite co l or with p in k p a w s .
No w he ' s in well condition s and always run s and s c r at ch es .
In my opinion la ng - 8 is a good idea for people who le ar n for e i g n language s ; D I ' m sure , I ' ll make a l ot of mistake s but it ' s re ally im p or t ant to try our a b il it ies , is n ' t ?
I come from P o l and and I ' m e i g h te en year s old .
I ' m in t re st ed in history , litera ture , sp or t , g e o g r a f y , re l i g i ous e t c .
In my free time I read b ook s ( my f a v o ur ite - th ri ll er s ; D ) , me e t with friend s and watch mo v ies .
I have n ' t done too many interest ing things re c ent ly , because I ' ve been so bu s y in con e ction with the end of the se m est er in school but w in ter ho l i day s are close ; )
( In school I have G er man too but I ha te it : P ) .
think ing about 4 cha n by 2 ch an ma d
It f as c in at ed me quick ly .
It has di r ty j o ke s and full of v it al ity .
I ' m 2 ch an ma d for de c ad e , and I de e p ly like s hu ta b a cha n n el , which in f l u ence d 4 ch an ' s c ul ture and str u c ture .
U s ing re al name is ra re .
J a p an e se you ng s ter s of ten talk as if I N 2 CHA N , about idea s from it , and some time s say `` I ' m 2 ch an n el er `` .
But it is a de c ad e a g o when 2 ch was started .
So I should get us ed to new way now , po s s i b ly .
They enjoy th r ow ing di r ty w or d s .
And I think they are less pro ble m at ic .
C o m p ar e to 2 ch an , th i er ha t r ed see m s dis or g an i z ed .
In 2 ch an , they at ta c k s ma in ly week people , es pe c i ally K or e an s or C h in e se in J an an , in te g r at ed people , woman s , and any on e who has we a k ness .
They th r ow di r ty w or d s each other .
they call every on e as f a g .
H o m o or straight , man or w ome n are not the point .
They call ho m o as ho m o f a g , straight as straight f a g .
They call w h ite as p i g , black as n i g g er .
So , there is we ir d e qu al ity .
But I think it ' s better to see Tokyo to w er in N I G H T !
And other p h ot o s are Z o j o j i temple .
He ll o very on e I am come back .
T h an k you for take care .
Yes ter day I went to b ook sh op since 1 1 . 0 0 am .
I was read a l ot of b ook there and one b ook thought me about how to write English well .
He said should be follow the sen ten se for m new paper or b ook .
and then read it again at f er finish ed write .
I tri ed to do it to day .
I will not ic e my English will be good or not > <
I ho pe this ti p may b e good for my friend s from here .
I went to Tokyo on business tri p this week .
So , I could keep little di ar y this week .
D ur ing I stay ed in Tokyo , I me t my friend .
And I went back my home t ow n to day ' s e ar ly morning .
The game of J a p an so c c er tea m will start right now .
E ver y on e is not alone , for it is every person s that con s is t of the so c i e ty .
On one hand , some person s hold the view that one should be re w ar d ed after do ing a good de ed .
No do u b t , it is kind of tra d i tion al C on f u c i an i a m .
F or my part , I f ir m ly believe that one who has a kind - heart should be give n a re w ar d or a p p l ous .
B e c a us e he or she de s er ve it .
It will has a po s it ive effect on public as well , which would in s p i re more c it i z en s .
A t least , the public me d i a , name ly T V st ation , new s p a p er , not only re p or t ent er tain ment new s , but also leave room for the se out st and ing or d in ar y c it i z en s .
To s um up , more at ten tion s should be pai d on those kind - heart ed person s .

I was so ha p p y as a well that I still could find some friend who re m m er me after one year .
and she always en c o ur age me s w im quick ly .
I could get down to sleep , but once I w o ke up in the middle of the night , it was very difficult to back to sleep again .
But all the things made me a w a ke more !

This the first time in this year .
My voice is n as al now , and not feel very good .
But they do n ' t work always .
J ust wait for the co l d will go away from me .
M a y b e having a good sleep is the be st way to c ur e from a co l d .
I try it .
But I do n ' t know it is work ing or not .
I took the me d ical c he c k - up just a month a g o .

any way , I will have got to go the c in e m a just alone and then bu y a sweet p op c or n and co la and then enjoy the time just alone .

There was not any on e but the tree and me in the my st ic at m o s p he re , and I felt like he had called me there .
This ex pe ri ence has been and will be my p re c i ous me m or y for ever .
I m p a c t of the t s un a m i was far be y on d im a g in ation of us .
To day ' s H a p p en ing to me
When we s ud d en ly understand the language which we have been le ar n ing without think ing , it make s us ha p p y .
To day I had an same ex pe ri ence to watch the J a p an e se new s .
In J a p an re c ent ly we he ar a l ot of b r ut al m ur d er s ' new s here and there .
One of the most f a m ous m ur d er s was ar re st ed just thirty minute s a g o .
A fter he k il led a B ri t ish woman who were teaching English in J a p an , he had been es c a p ing for two year s .
The woman ' s father had come to J a p an to appeal to sea r ch the m ur d er many time s unti l he was ar re st ed .
The police str u g g led to sea r ch him , and two week s a g o one e f f ic i ent ti p s which he was w it ness ed in N a g o y a was b ro ad c a st through the me d i a .
A t all he was ar re st ed in O s a k a though .
When I watch ed the new s , the new s c aster s ud d en ly spoke English and started to in ter v i e w to the s u f f er er ' s father .
When I listen ed to the father ' s English , I could understand his English most of part s .
S in ce my d aught er was c ur i ous about his English , I tra n s la ted it into J a p an e se to her .
U s u ally when we listen to English in ter v i e w through the me d i a , we can read di al o g s in J a p an e se .
However , the in ter v i e w was s ud d en ly happen ed ; the di al o g did n ' t see m to p re p ar e in time .
There f or e , I could listen to the English in ter v i e w without J a p an e se di al o g s .
The father was c ry ing and a p p re c i at ed to J a p an e se police s .
I would like to listen to English new s more from now on .
If p at ent ex ha us tion was in e v it able by condition al s al es , con s um er s would enjoy more un c on d i tion al s al es .
U n d er such circumstance , `` s el f - re p l ic ation `` ty pe pro d u c t s , such as ce ll line s or so f t w ar e , should need p at ent l ic en se to be re p l ic at ed .
I will have a first ex a m at my new school on O c t 9 .
I want to give a good impress ion to my new teachers .
So I re v is e the less ion s I have le ar t d ur ing the ho l i day .
I ' m a f ri ed I c a n ' t do the be st in our class .
N e x t , I will go on re v is ing .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to do ing the ex a m .
W ish I will have a go o g gra d es .
He ll o , n ic e to me e t you !
To m or r ow , I have a in ter v i e w t est .
`` T e ll about something which impress ed you d ur ing this se m est er and something which has dis a p po in ted you .
G ive three reason s for each . ``
help ! ! !
The class which impress ed me d ur ing this se m est er is `` in t ro d u ction for ( My un ive r s ity name ) st ud ies `` .
F ir st reason , a le c ture is different p rofessor every time , so I could he ar different interest ing le c ture which is n ' t in my f i el d .
S e c on d ly , the point s of each f i el d are con d en s ed in each le c ture , so I understand education al
I do n ' t think out X (
To make a long story for short . ( am I right ? ) To be honest ly I do n ' t have a long story , L O L !
I mean A person ' s fight c a n ' t change the world , even c a n ' t change himself , so that mean s nothing .
But his a ction may b e en c o ur age other s who know this , year to year , the world can be change d .
The w or d `` b a m `` I mean c he at .
R A V I , I want to know why did you c or re c t the w or d `` b or n `` into `` bo re `` in the sen t ence `` I told them may b e their mo m s b or n them in or d er `` , what I want to say is their mo m s made a de al with their b ir th day s and then b or n one in one day , just like in or d er .
I think the side effect s of me d ic in e is pretty strong , My mouth had a ul c er again .
L a st time I had this ant i b i ot ic me d ic in e was because my too th was p ul led out , and I got my mouth u c l er bad ly , this happen d again .
I stay ed at home for who le day , watch ed f il m s , read b ook , you know that I read some pretty good ar t ic le s , b ook make s me pe a ce .
I b ough t j u ic e which is f r u it s and ve g e t able s mi x ture , I thought it can im p ro ve my im m un ity , but it was too co o l , I had to mi x hot water in , the funny was th a I could n ' t me as ur e how much hot water I need ed , so the mi x ture either hot or else co o l , that made my th ro at more un c o m f or t able T _ T .
B a c k to the to p ic , I was think ing that I need some m us ic when I was having dinner , so I just c l ic k ed here and there on my comp ut er ( in my comp ut er ?
I did n ' t re m e m b er when I copy y ed them from D V D s .
I re m e m b er ed that the first time I watch ed M ic ha el J a c k s on ' s v id e o in 1 996 .
Then we r ent his other V C D s from st or e .
I just like the r h y th m .
A fter three year s I listen d his m us ic again because one of his m us ic v id e o `` man in the mi r r or `` I was sh o k ed by this v id e o , I did n ' t know what to say , I was im p a c t .
I found that I had n ' t see all his m us ic v id e o , I did i n ' t know him , after w ar d I read some i nformation about him .
I watch ed <Transsiberian> <BurnAfterReading> <Traitor> to day .
The be ne f it of i ll ness is that I can watch f il m all day .
I watch So u th p ar k for le ar n ing e ng l ish but I c a n ' t understand all their j o ke s .
I did n ' t watch A qu a T e en H un g er F or ce , but I will , you know I never los e anything good , L O L !
`` One P i e ce `` is a J a p a ness c ar t o on , it is pretty good s er ies !
I had it enough !
If I re c a ll anything , I will tell you by my dr e a m ! !

I enjoy ed at am us e ment ar c ad e in A k i ha b ar a
I like stay ing at am us e ment ar c ad e since I was a ch il d .

One of my friend s in t ro d u c ed me to this so ng 8 year s a g o .
And I never for g e t it because this so ng is re ally beautiful !
I was b or ed in the morning so I s an g it .

What am I do ing so l ate ?

P le a e pro o f re ad it .
I had had a dr e a m to become a s ing er since I was a little ch il d .
The dr e a m came tru e , but I got i ll after a while .
I put my care er on hold to conc ent r ate on treat ment .
That time , I must to read many te ch n ical b ook s and some translation s to P or t u gue se was so poor that it was e as i er try ing to understand the original one s .
This is de f in it ive ly f un n er !

O f course also we or d in ar y people can eat there .
The se sound quite re la ted to my previous job .
W o ul d you please tell me more about the pro j e c t s and what s c al e are the pro j e c t s ?
M a y I know when can I receiv e the re s ul t of this round of in ter v i e w ?
I ' m new here and j o in ed , because I think I need people , w o h c or re c t
my writing and give me a d v ic es for my study ing .
So I tell you something about me .
- the w or st in language
S p an ish as from the next gra d e
- I l o ve draw ing , read ing and to play g u it ar
I ho pe there are a l o of people , who will c or re c t my di ar y ent ri es .
There is O s a k a P re f e c ture U n ive r s ity near my house .
A l th ough I neither am no r was a st ud ent there , I can ut il i z e it , because I live in O s a k a P re f e c ture and have the c it i z en s h i p .
As long as the person have the c it i z en s h i p , they can have the right to this `` public `` l i b r ar y .
It has too much am o un t of b ook s .
In the past , it close s at 8 o ' clock sh ar p .
But this time , it ' s pro l on g ed it s open time .
I can visit there even in week day .
A month a g o , my English teacher a d v is ed that we can im p ro ve listen ing by mean s of V O A or B B C .
B e c a us e of the poor listen ing , I ch o o se the V O A sp e c i al e ng l ish - education re p or t .
I almost listen it every day .
when the first time , I can catch some w or d s and simple sen t ence s .
the second time , I will read the te x t and tra n s l ate it .
the th ir d time , I can comp le te ly know every w or d s and it s mean ing .
what ' s your a d v is e ?
How can I take well a d v ant age of V O A ?
U N I Q L O and The i re B us i ness S t r ate g y .
If you live in J a p an , I am sure you have heard of U N I Q L O or you have visit ed there .
It ' s one of the J a p an e se most f a m ous c l o th ing st or es .
I read it s found er ' s in ter v i e w and found it quite interest ing .
H is name is T ad ash i Ya n a i , a J a p an e se B i ll ion a i re .
He is ra n k ed at 8 9 in `` F or b es b i ll ion a i re l is t `` .
F ir st of all , what dis ting u ish es `` U N I Q L O ' is they provide high - qu al ity b as ic s with an a f f or d able p ri ce ta g .
One of their e f e a ture it e m s is so - called ' he at te ch in n er `` .
It ' s a th in in n er but it in it s el f g en er ate s he at it ' s very us e ful es pe c i ally in w in ter .
M o st of my friend s in J a p an were us ing it as an every day us e .
U N I Q L O has now 7 5 0 bra n ch es includ ing 4 a b ro ad bra n ch .
The great er the ri s k the great er the po s s i b il ity for pro f it s `` .
In my opinion , what he said is tru e but when you become a to p , you are also respon s i ble for your co - work er s and their e family .
I also believe it has some interest in l u c k and your back g r ound .
You may need your p ar ent s s up p or t , a f in an c i al s up p or t , and some people s u c ce ed very easily because of their e family .
No w I just read a l ate st new s that U N I Q L O has an no un c ed that they were going to change their e comp an y ' s co m m on language into English from 2 0 1 2 3 in or d er to keep up with a g l o b al gr ow th .
That ' s interest ing .
It is one hour ' s dr ive from my place .
It was re l at ive ly mi l d and clear we a ther so , it was a per f e c t day to play ten n is outside .
The place is in hi ll s id e and we can view a ri ver and mo un tain s over the ten n is co ur t .
C an you see a small w h ite part in the picture ?
I find that the C h ies e ex a m s is more difficult than English ex a m .
I wish I can be an A m er ic an next life but can speak C h in e se well .
But a l o c al f est i v al is suppose d to be he l d to day , so I had re s ch ed ul ed to day ' s less on . ) I had a sp ar e time more than usual .
And then , I me m or i z ed us e ful express ion s and w or d s , al th ough some of them were s l i p p ed out of my mind easily .
Well , the te x t b ook s , which I re g ul ar ly listen to , are p il ing up , so not only should I keep up with every less on , but I should also re v i e w the back number s not to for g e t the new w or d s e t c .
`` I not only keep up with . . . . . , but also re v i e w . . . . . ``
I me t a man de ve l op ing me d ical in st r u ment there .
I ' d like to as k him the in d ust ry because I have been study ing b i ome d ical e ng in e er ing .
I know we will talk for many things but I am not p re p ar ed yet .
In case of I will do a mistake , what I will do then ?
This is my first time to write the di ar y on this we b .
I never think about I can c or re c t other people ' s er r or in my n at ive language .
I was star v ing , because I did n ' t eat b re a k f a st and l un ch .
V ar i ous and a l ot of me at s were serve d one after another .
I also tri ed a bo t t le of P er u v i an be er `` C ry st al ``
It ' s so good for our he al th .
S or ry . . . L an g - 8 friend s .
I ' d like to apologize for my ' not ent er ing this sit e for a long long time . ' .
I had to p re p ar e my B ook G o l d en B e ll , ( I G ot S e c on d place . .
but I was first in T h ir d gra d e and F o ur th gra d e : > ) C h in e se letter t est and most of all the comp ut er t est .
A t least what made me ha p p y was that I got 1 0 0 on C h in e se t est and got first place on comp ut er .
L at er this month , there will be a big t est .
I ho pe you understand when I do se n ' t ent er this sit e for a week or so .
There ' s one commen t that I want to tell you . ' I ' m sorry '
I s it c or re c t ?
We had re c or d he a v y ra in here and there in J a p an .
T r a in s were stop p ed and a l ot of ro ad s are close d to tra f f ic .
My d aught er had to sit and wait in the stop p ed train for a long time on the way from high school .
The ty p h o on cause d serious da m age s to s ever al are as in J a p an .
Some house s , many c ar s , and so on were s w ept away by the over f l ow ed water .
I ` m living N a g o y a in J a p an .
and I ` m a un ive r s ity st ud ent ma j or , me ch an ical e ng in e er ing .
J a p an has n ` t much re s o ur ce s .
No w I be l on g to a un ive r s ity in J a p an and I ma j or in D ent is t ry .
F ro m to day , I have to take c l in ical train ing s every day without week en d s .
I was very n er v ous d ur ing train ing , but I man age d to pass go .
A t first , I have to tell you that . . .
A ll of my family and friend s are s a f e .
I could n ' t go home at the night because of full s us p en s ion of the train s er v ic e , and I walk ed to my home for hour s in the next morning .
It was a good ex er c is e for me .
( In fact , I was re ally s c ar ed at the e ar th qu a ke . . .
It help ed me con t in u ed f ir m .
We are face d to serious and un e x pe c ted dis aster s by the e ar th qu a ke and t s un a m i .
There are people those who los t their home s .
We have re c o ver ed from c ri s is es many time s .
We re c o ver ed from Tokyo D a ish in s a i and H an s h in D a ish in s a i .
which la u g age I should ch o o se ?
if you were me , what will you do ?
g er man y - I have le ar n t for one year , but I can only read without know ing it s mean ing .
J a p an e se - I am re ally interest ed in it , but I know nothing about it now , I like watch j a p an e se c ar t o on very much .
please you have ex pe ri ence on le ar n ing language s give me some suggest ion s .
It has been ra in ing for all day long .
But , I was dr en ch ed with ra in .
I had change d my dress at the same time I got home .
A fter me al s , I have to study for dr i v ing t est .
I ' ve f a il ed it for t w ic e , there f or e I wish I pass the next t est .
To day , one friend ' s told me a funny history .
She was talk ing me about her tra ve l to S c ot l and , when she re m e m b er ed something about a t - shirt works h op .
And she told that :
`` We ' re in t - shirt works h op , and my friend s , who like s a l ot ra p m us ic , de c id ed to made t - shirt s with a me s s age that show ed their pass ion by ra p p ing .
And they w ro te the ti t t le me s s age ( `` I l o ve my ra p p er `` x D ) .
When they were walk ing by the street , people laugh ed a l ot look ing at their , and they did n ' t know why they were laugh ing .
Then , they dis c o ver that `` ra p er `` in English do n ' t mean `` person who s ing ra p `` .
Then they were very e m b ar r as ed about this ha ha ha ha ``
I think that It ' s a funny history , because there are a l ot of time s that we w ro te something wrong because it sound s like sp an ish w or d s that have got different s mean ing s x P
Yes ter day , my friend s invite d me to go water ra f ting and c amp ing with them some other time .
They always change their mind by follow ing their mo o d .
A l th ough they made a a w es ome p l an on c amp ing , I am wonder ing if they will ful f i ll it .
T e ch n ic ally , you may say that they are out of normal so you never know what their next s te p is .
M or e o ver , I ho pe that our c amp ing could be sleep in a c amp er but not in a l o g c a b in .
This is because I ' ve never been in c amp er so far .
On S at ur day , I took a so l o ri d e up to so u th are a of K y ot o from my a p ar t ment .
There is a b i ke ro ut e run through the are a along the R ive r Y o d o and then R ive r K i z u .
I like this ro ut e because it is f l at from begin n ing to end al th ough I some time s u f f er from w in d that blow s against me .
A fter le aving my a p ar t ment , I kept ri d ing to the first point where I p l an n ed to have l un ch .
I took a good re st there and started ri d ing again to w ar d the turn - round point .
There are tea p l ant ation s along the ri ver , and I saw ri ce f i el d s f il led with water of which p l ant ing has been almost comp le ted .
D ur ing the ri d e , many ri d er s pass ed me as I was s l ow .
A l th ough I worry about get ting s un b ur n and am ex ha ust ed some time s because of strong s un s h in e es pe c i ally in mi d - s um m er , I feel great when I finish ri d ing .
I re s um ed to go to dr i v ing school .
In J a p an , people have to gradua te from dr i v ing school with in n in e month s , once they entered into .
I entered into my dr i v ing school in mi d - S ept e m b er , so the de ad line of my gradua tion is in mi d - J un e .
I still have three month s now .
On the other hand , the co st I am pay ing to get dr i v ing l ic ence is ra p id ly b a ll o on ing .
J ud g ing from the pro g re s s cha r t , I would end up having sp ent more than $ 3 0 0 0 just to get dr i v ing l ic ence .
Well , most of in st r u c t or s in school are n ic e and as s id u ous ly tell me how to dr ive and what I have to be a w ar e of .
Y e t $ 3 0 0 0 is too ex p en s ive to me .
I gue s s , people can get their dr i v ing l ic ence s without sp en d ing such am o un t of money in other country .
How much money do you need to pay to get your dr i v ing l ic ence or to comp le te dr i v ing school education in your country ?
To day is T h ur s day , and no sp e c i al things .
On ly one different thing name ly I became an hour sen d er this after no on .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t like that .
I like to write co d e more than that .
But my case have finish ed in 3 month s a g o .
So , In addition to mo d if y the bu g ( it ' s mean is s u e ) found by my c l i ent , I am not bu s y .
I took off at 7 p m and went home by my mo t or c y c le .
I ' m as k ing all of you includ ing K or e an .
I want to j o in off - line English gr o up but I do n ' t know about that at all .
This effect is that the s k in is re ne w ed .
B y my mar ri g e I will go to est e six time s .
I wonder how I c he ng e .
we c le an ed the w in d ow s , floor , and was h ed the c ur tain s .
I ' m so tired after do ing all of the things .
I was a co u ch p ot at o .
but F ro m now on , I ' m go n n a study hard and work out .
W at ch ing As i an game was a time k i ll er .
But like some on e said , L if e is not a sp e c t at or sp or t s .
As get ting co l d the se days , I just at e over and over like c r a z y person .
S ud d en ly I just stop p ed watch ing T V and went out to walk .
I j o g g ed and did j um p ro pe .
I ' ll go back to the days I live every moment .
I want to be able to speak English .
My F ir st S ing n in
I us e this we b s ite for the first time .
W or k H ar d S t ud y H ar d er P la y L es s er
B us y at work and hard ly man age d the time between job and j a p an e se class .
T h an k s G o d the hard work got pai d off .
I had good re v i e w and salary raise .
She is kind teacher and I like to study under her g u id ance .
He ' s good teacher too .
It ' s trouble s ome for work ing st ud ent like me .
I ' m de d ic at ing free time for pro d u c t ive act i v ity .
On ly understand simple gr e e ting .
I did n ' t f an c y the co f f e e but the place has good ha ng out view .
A t night J a k ar ta has good me t ro po l it an view with light s every where .
I ' m not sure how to us e this very much .
I want to speak English more s m o o th ly and le ar n a l ot of for e i g n c ul ture s .
D o ing that , I can see J a p an more clear ly than before .
And I was very ha p p y , I think I will be a d d ic ted to le ar n ing English .
M a ke le ar n ing English as an interest , and work hard , I think I will make a big pro g es s !
And than k s many In ter ne t friend s for c or re c ting my mistake s !
If you need me about you C h in e se , I will do my be st to help you !
I C ome B a c k
I come back be c a se the C E T will be he l d .
It look s very ter ri ble .
It see m s to me is the de v il .
In my point , the language is us ed to co m m un ic ate for each other .
If you understand my mean and I k ow n what you say that is enough .
Why have some body he l d ex a m in ation s to want get your language le ve l .
I c a n ' t see why the t est s c or es can re f le c t our language le ve l .
I thought about who I was
I am 2 5 year s old .
E x a c t ly what I thought was that I was bad and I need ed to make me better .
What if I was better before than now ?
What if I ' m le ad ing myself to the wrong way ?
One thing I am sure is I was n ' t sha b b y like this before .
The more I try to im p ro ve myself the more some other thing of mi ne is being de st ro i ed a p p ar ent ly .
I think I have made myself de v a st at ed in some way s .
L u c k i ly I know how to go back because that was how I was
T H E E N G L I S H L E C T U R E
so I ' m look ing for some on e who tea ch es me English while le ar n ing it by myself .
No w I ' m try ing to re g is ter the English le c ture for next ter m .
What do you think of this s up le ment ?
My friend came to my house , when I was about to start study ing English this
morning , But we enjoy ed cha t ting .
While the cha t ting I re c o g n i z ed that she is into tak ing a s up p le ment called
J a p an e se `` Ka ku s an `` .
that dr in k is quite effect ive for us such as all er g ic sick ness can c er
di a b e te s , this s up le ment is just like all - around me d ic in e .
But the p ri ce was too ex p en s ive to keep on tak ing for me .
people had a he at ed ar g u ment about that .
It made me more con f us e .
She s ud d en ly sat up on the be d , in the middle of the night .
A n y way , short story this time so you do n ' t los e so much time : 3 than k s to every on e read ing and c or re c ting and commen ting n _ _ n !
to day I ' m going to talk ing about `` friend ``
comp ar e some on e who sh r as es the bad and good
but , most of all be st friend is like me in e ve y way .
One of my friend , H i ro k i told me this sit e .
H i ro k i , than k s !
So I want to im p ro ve my English writing s k i ll here .
G o l d en We e k - j a p an e se long va c ation
There is a long va c ation called `` G o l d en We e k `` in J a p an from the end of A p ri l to the begin n ing in M a y .
The co st of tra ve l ri se s very much comp ar ed with usual time .
I have not been to for e i g n co un t ri es in the sea s on , but I p l an to go to H on g K on g and M a c a o with my family this year .
There is a l ot of de l ic i ous f o o d s in H on g K on g , so could you re c o m m en d your favor ite ?
When I was in C h in a , I just us ed QQ cha t ted with my friend s on line .
A l th ough , I know F a ce B ook was p op ul ar in the world .
but in C h in a we could n ' t con ne c t F a ce B ook , because C h in e se go ver n ment just all ow ed us us ed R en R en which was copie d from F a ce B ook .
M a y b e it was the first time us ed it I did n ' t know we ther my friend s are on line or not , l ot s of me s s age s on the F a ce B ook made me felt a b it me s s , may b e 3 month s la ter it will be more `` easy going `` .
To day is only part time job .
R e c ent ry , my j un k y ar d is very d u ll .
So , to day s part time is 4 p a st half unti l 1 1 .
M o st co m m on ly is 4 p a st half unti l mi d night .
It finish ed work ing when I went back home and went to be d e ar ly .
One day in a ra in y even ing a c at w and er ed around in los t , which was ent i re ly we t and c ry ing a l ot .
The old man and woman name d it ' M i qu e ' and treat ed her like their re al ch il d .
When a c ust ome r put the money on the t able M i ke s ud d en ly s w ept the money down to a money bo x under ne a th with one c ry of `` me ow `` .
The c ust ome r was so de light ed with ra p ture that he a d v ic ed the old woman to change the name of the sh op ' Ka ke g a w a - l o c al p ow er ri ce c a ke s ' to simpl y ' C at ri ce c a ke s ' for the s a ke of pro s p er ous business .
In a sen se a c ust um er name d their sp e c i al ity ' C at ri ce c a ke s ' .
He told me the re s ul t of the perform ance e v al u ation for the past six month s .
I receiv ed the high est point in our e v al u ation s y s te m .
I ' ve never receiv ed that high point since I j o in ed this comp an y .
I was de light ed that our man age r s had re c o g n i z ed my effort .
I felt a p p re c i at ed very much .
H on est ly , I get pai d much high er than the a ver age J a p an e se people at the same age .
In addition , than k s to this high est e v al u ation , I will receiv e hu g e am o un t of bo n us this s um m er .
When I come to think of the am o un t of money which I receiv e , I some time s feel a little b it g u il ty .
Even though a l ot of comp an ies and people are str u g g ling with a g l o b al e c on o m ic down t ur n , we always receiv e high s al ar ies .
We at e s al ad and me e t there .
In the end , surprise c a ke a p p er ed !
S k y pe is very us e ful a p p re c i ation , and we can con ta c t with people around the world without any charge , but it has some de m er it s .
It is that we must sit in front of our comp ut er s while we us e s k y pe , but I can us e s k y pe every where with i P h on e .
D e c id ing the d ate that is easy to re m e m b er is what ' s im p or t ant !
It sound s like `` than k you `` in English , is n ' t it ?
I went to an a ir p or t to see off my w if e ( and our b a b y in her inside ) yesterday .
O ur p l an in the past was that we will go back to J a p an to g e ther around S ept e m b er .
However , she has got p re g n an c y , so it seemed to be better for her to go back there as e ar ly as possible ( at least her mother ' s opinion ) .
Then , I started to sp en d s ing le life in the U K .
I found be l ow sit e .
I think no ri c en se ri d er should be a p p ri c i at ed more .
To m or r ow , I am part ic i p at ing a volunteer act i v ity of c le an ing up a be a ch
at Ka n a g a w a p re f e c ture with my friend .
There was not a follow ing t un a m i to day ,
but now I became an x i ous about a tomorrow ' s po s s i b il ity of t un a m i .
The day before yesterday was a In d i an f est i v al .
C o m p ar e to In d i an , I became a mi n or ity .
The look ing of the temple is very ma j est ic and sp e c ta c ul ar .
N ever th e less , the next even t is b or ing .
I sp ent 5 do ll ar s to get the entrance ti c ke t but I just stay over there for 3 0 mi n s .
This is because my friend would like to leave .
I was a little in bad mo o d .
If he had done it , we would n ' t have pai d it .
I thought that it ' s too t ough for me to understand mo v ies in English .
Then , we follow ed his propos al .
A l th ough he is a n ic e d ud e , he is suppose d to ch er ish money and sp ent it in s m ar t me th o d .
I ' ll le ar n the w or d ' ' sub m it ' '
I ' ll us e it in tri al .
I sub m it ted my re s um e to the comp an y which I want to work for .
I ' ll sub m it some do c u ment s to the e m b as s y for get ting V I S A .
I have to sub m it my home w or k to the school .
I got a co l d . . .
- The s i z e of his house ga ve me a sh o ke .
- As far as I know most k or e an and j a p an se people know what `` G en er al character of each b l o o d ty pe `` is and I think they take it s w or d .
I do n ' t know if other s who are not k or e an or j a p an e se know it or not .
- I have heard about `` S i g n `` and I think it is similar to how `` G en er al character of each b l o o d ty pe `` works .
my sign is L e o and it say s L e o people are bra ve and act ive .
I usual ly take them just for f un but some time s they are re ally right on me .
I would be surprise d about this but now I think it is not that big de al .
well , it could be enough because there is a co in c id ence .
- A n y way I enjoy c ar t o on s of G en er al character of each b l o o d ty pe .
my b l o o d ty pe is B and it de s c ri b es as B ty pe people are op t im is t ic but c a p ri c i ous .
and they ten d to speak out .
It look s like a per f e c t ma t ch with i p ad .
You can in s er t the i p ad ho ri z on t ally into the s l ot while off ic i al a p p le i p ad ke y b o ar d only can do it in ver t ical way !
And when you finish us ing and co ver your i p ad to the ke y b o ar d , it turn s your i p ad to an a p p le not e p ad im m ed i ate ly !
u h h h , I might be able to get it from some e - co m m er ce we b s ite s here which im p or ted it by un o f f ic i al way , but I do n ' t want take ri s k because ke y b o ar d is just a f r a g i le to y in some way .
I have a little b it of question .
A re there some r ul es when I write `` S in ce `` or `` As `` on the to p of a sen t ence ?
I ent ri ed L an g - 8 to day .
I ' ve been study ing English ma in ly .
In addition to it , I ' ve been also study ing S p an ish a little .
I ' d l i le to co m m un ic ate with those who speak English and study now .
P le a se make friend s with me .
A n y on e we l c ome ! !
So do n ' t has it ate to con ta c t me .
T h an k you for read ing my di ar y .

I ' m G o ing To G o C o st o c o

I will bu y the m u f f in and the p a el la for l un ch with my family .
H a ve you ever go to C o st o c o ?
What do you have a re c ome n d ?
I have to re p or t my as s i g n ment by We d ne s day , but there ' s trouble something with my comp ut er .
I don t ' know how to so l ve .
I tri ed in va in to so l ve it about 2 days .
A l th ough My ma j or is C o m p ut er S c i ence , I see m to be comp ut er i ll it er a c y .
There w o n ' t be a pro ble m , if the as s i g n ment is person al ta s k .

The ir ' s f a ir way of the ho le they were play ing were next to the ro ad .
When the first man began to s w ing , a he ar se came along the ro ad , he stop p ed and face d the f un er al pro ce s s ion for a while , and when the he ar se pass ing by the pro ce s s ion , he b ow ed his head in p r a y er .
When they were walk ing to the gr e en , the second man said , `` That was a to u ch ing show of respect for ( to ? ) the de ce as ed back there .
I had no idea ( did n ' t re al i z e ? ) you were so sen t i ment al . ``
The first man sh r u g g ed and said , `` This is the least I could do .
If you want to read the C h in e se ver s ion , please c l ic k the be l ow l in k ; )
though some people believe consider able pro p or t on of r ur al students would put great effort s on le ar n ing , it is man if e a st that there re ally is a p h en ome n on that r ur al students are to be more pro ne to difficult y of un ive r s it ies entrance .
in my o b s er v ation , un ive r s it ies should re n d er the se students as s is t ance give n the re al ity that dis t in ction between different are as .

What s ing er s do you like in J a p a m ?
To day , I ' m writing about one of my favor ite ar ch ite c t , O t t o W a g n er 1 8 4 1 - 1 9 1 8 , who was a f a m ous ar ch ite c t and T ow n p l an n er in V i en n a .
He was one of the great p ion e er s of the mo d er n V i en ne se mo ve ment `` S es s ion `` .
To tell the tru th , I went to V i en n er for school tri p last s um m er and saw some O t t o W a g n er ' s bu il d ing s .
es pe c i ally , I like the po st office .
This po st office S aving s B an k is one of the W or l d He ri t age s ite in V i en n er .
This bu il d ing is de s i g n ed of al um in i um and g la s s .
In those days , the se ma ter i al s were ra re to be us ed .
That ' s why O t t o W a g n er was called the great p ion e er s of the mo d er n .
To day is f in al day in G W ( G o l d en We e k ) which mean s long ho l i day s .
I do n ' t w an a work any m or e . . .
but I have to make a life . . .
This is an en c o ur a g ing for us .
We con t in u e to p r a c t ic e for next conc er t at the same place .
I was b or n and re is ed in J a p an e .
I study ing English by m y s el f .
My work is ha ir ar re ng e and make up ar t is t .
I l o ve this work .
My do re a m is to have one ' s sh op .
There f or e ma k ing up want s to make a study a b ro ad .
P e op le living near my house of ten give s my family ve g e t able s such as to m at o s and c u c um b er s in s um m er .
So , I eat to m at o s day after day in s um m er .
people who give ve g e t able s like ma k ing them .
I think that old people like ma k ing ve g e t able s better than you ng people in J a p an .
I ' m s ty ud ing English and C h in e se .
T h o se are difficult .
V is it ing to K y ot o
I have live d in K y ot o when I was a un ive r s ity st ud ent .
I went to K y ot o with my w if e and so n .
I live in S h i g a next to K y ot o .
It took about thirty minute s by c ar .
I b ough t some it e m s such as a p en case , a P o st - it e t c with my so n while my w if e had S H I A T S U ( a kind of body ma s s age s in J a p an ) .
I us ed a s ling that help s c ar ry ing my so n .
It might see m to be I K U M E N ( We call the man who ch il d c ar e hard in J a p an re c ent ly ) .
Besides work ing on the ta s k my p rofessor as s i g n ed to me , I ' ve been still bu s y for my job - hu n ting on the In ter ne t this week .
I only at ten d ed two job in ter v i e w s unti l now .
I did n ' t have any ex p ri ence of p ur ch as er position .
Well , I gue s s because it was a p ri v ate comp an y and one of the two in ter v i e w er was the C E O , so he asked what ever he want ed to know for it was H I S comp an y .
No matter what he w ro te it down for , I did n ' t like it .
The g en er al man age r said a l ot to me , includ ing her two over se a m aster s ' de g re e , her work ing at t it ud e and high stand ar d on can d id ate s e t c .
She said she was a er g as i o man i a who works 1 4 hour s every day .
She was very pro ud that she work ed 6 year s in C h in a , and then went a b ro ad to work and get her de g re es at the same time .
That was out of my im a g in ation .
She asked my salary expect ion and how could I think I w or th that much money .
It was a t ough question , es pe c i ally when she asked it in a a g g re s s ive way .
She said my expect ion could be re a ch ed after I work for 2 or 3 year s and I have to work from the very b as ic position .
The pro ble m was that my expect ion salary was the co m m on stand ar d in gradua te s .
A t last , the s al es man age r told me to call her tomorrow if I de c id e to accept the job .
B e c ous e I go to far a way place I have not been and is good ex ce c is e .
It does not co st us a l ot of money to go c y ling .
I ' m un ive r s ity st ud ent , and ma j or ing in J a p an e se litera ture .
E s pe c i ally I le ar n about a mo d er n no ve l and a C h ri st i an write r s no ve l in J a p an .
I ' m not much good at anything , but please be kind to me .
But I have a l ot of home w or k yet .
I want to go to be d as e ar ly as I can ! !
U n ive r s ity st ud ent is very hard .
S t ud y a b ro ad is ne c c ar y to speak for e i g n language to hand le s k i ll ful ly ? ?
How do you think ? ?
The ex a m is done only once a year .
Y e ar before last and last year I could pass the first t est but f a il ed the sen c on d t est .

The re s ul t will be an no un c ed the of this month .
What are you do ing in N e w year ho l i day ?
To day is the last day of No ve m b er , and 2 0 1 0 will end soon .
My family is going to tri p d ur ing new year ho l i day , but we have not de c id ed where to go l o l .
To day I will find some place s and take re s er v ation for it .
D o you have any re c o m m en d ation ?
And what are you do ing in new year ho l i day ?
I re g is ter ed an account to this sit e to day .
I de c id ed to writing on 3 time s in week .
But my w if e asked me to go a l un ch with me after my sh op p ing .
I had no idea to have a l un ch with my w if e d ur ing week day s .
E ver y day , I am work ing for a comp an y , and my w if e is keep ing my house .
B as ic ally , it is im po s s i ble to have a l un ch with her .
But it was possible if I could take a half day off .
I have never found it .
We went to the w in e sh op at first , and then we had a good l un ch at an old J a p an e se re st a ur ant .
B y the way , I had to bu y a w in e to day for my friend .
He invite me to the even t .
In s te ad , I will give him a w in e to express my than k s to him .
B y the way , it will be ho l i day tomorrow ( is about to to day . . . ) in J a p an .
P la ce to live

It depend s when / how I have to go up to M in ne s ot a .
I ' m p l an n ing to take G re y h ound .
I got ta take a mo ve quick ly .
It ' s the middle of the se m est er , but I ' m both er ed about after the se m est er .
It ' s mo n day !
We e k en d has go ne and mo n day has come !
Yes ter day I made new f ri ed n s at L an g - 8 and I got first c or re ction ~
T h an k you for my c or re ction T ur ku a se .
E ver y mo n day In this se m est er , I have only one class so I do n ' t feel b ur d en d ur ing week en d .
I could n ' t read my ma j or b ook s well and I could n ' t conc ent r ate well .
I think I should n ' t ha ng out too much d ur ing week en d or it would make me hard to start another new week .
O M G , To m or r ow I have five class , 3 of them are my ma j or .
I have to c le an my room be f ro e C h in e se new year .
When I was w o ke up and went to work .
I see S ar u was on line in st ic k a m .
I was look ing for a good we b s ite for c or re c ting my e ng l ish , and I found out this co o l one .
I l o ve le ar n ing e ng l ish and have been study ing through am er ic an show , mo v ies , and p op m us ic .
I also have p l an to le ar n another language like j a p an e se that I tired to study in high school or g er man .
I would be very ha p p y if I could help your writing w it ten in k or e an .
I ' m coming home to day from E ur o pe tri p for one month .
It was very ex c it ing , im p or t ant , ha p p i ness , and pe a ce h ul for me .
I ' ll never for g e t it for ever !
I de c id e to write my p re c i ous me m or y day at a time in English .
I ' m not good at E ng ul ish .
But I ' ll try !
B e c a us e ,

He is a f o m ous J a p an e se m us ic i an and a g u it ar is t .

He is going to A m er ic a to have some live s .
I l o ve `` P op is D e ad `` is the be st .
P le a se c he c k his so ng s on the In ter ne t ! ! ! !
I ' m in my gr and p ar ent ' s house and stay here for 4 days long .
A fter that time , we had a bu f f e t me al .
We could also see a l ot of c ook ing there as well as bath .
of course there are a l ot of other me n u ! !
However my gr and p ar ent were n ' t s u f f ic i ent : - (
D o you know it s reason ? ?
How do you sp en d to day ?
I re c c ome n d you to see it if you have n ' t .
R e c ent ly I think , H i ro M i z us h im a is most beautiful person .
When he was act or , he is very act i v ity .
He a p p er ed on va ri ous T V , mo v i e and C M .
I was sure to watch his T V and so on .
S in ce at that time , I re s pe e c t him .
H is first b ook is p ur s u ed good re s ul t .
I think that his ability and effort is en or m ous .
One day , de e p ly I looked inside the b ow l and I watch ed him for a w h i le .
his mouth always mo ve s .
Why do n ' t you get me into a big g er tank with more fish in it ?
I put some p l ant s at the bo t t o m of the tank ,
A g a in I went to the pe t st or e and b ough t three more go l d f ish .

To day I work ed over time , asked my w if e and so n to go to her p ar ent s home .
No w I am alone home .
C o ul d you c he c k my s el f - in t ro d u ction as follow s ?
It ' s my first time to see him and the first op p or t un ity de ve l p ing the ability of English as in ter n ation al and business L an g u age s .
C a ll me R i y e for short .
I am work for A B C comp an y J a p an .
I have been work ing as s y s te m p l an n er at I T de v is ion for 1 year just in this J un e .
But before this work , I ' ve been there as I T con s ul t ant 5 year s , so I am e v ry f a m il i ar with this comp an y .
The re c ent bo o m or to p ic s of my works are `` O ur comp an y to take c us ut ome r ex pe ri ence to the next le ve l with something di g it al `` .
F or many year s since we ' ve been us ing i nformation te ch no l o g y as business too l s , the comp an y put in money co st - s aving do m a in .
F in ance , P ur ch as ing , S al es A d m in is t r ation are the most im p or t ant do m a in s and have e c on o m ic effect s of I T in ve st ment .
But now the time to us e I T for de ve l op ing c l o o se l o op re l ation s h i p between our st or es and c ust ome r .

I would like to dis c us s with c ent r al office me m b er s about my idea s de ta il a b o ve .
This is the one of the most im p or t ant reason why I want to study e ng l ish .
A n y way I can have a good re l ation with you .
in a w ar m sp r ing light
I m writing j o ur n al for to day s class , I know there are some gra m m at ical er r or s ,
but , I don t know how I m suppose d to c or re c t .
F ir st of all , as I am a J a p an e se , I am glad to study about this to p ic ; N u c le ar B o m b .
T h r ough o ut The ro ad from hi ro s h im a , I found that n u c le ar bo m b g en er ate s re ally nothing , even so r r ow , l on el i ness and s ad ness .
In the last part of `` A w h ite B l ous e `` , F or in st ance , it say s `` there was n ' t a so ul on the p l at f or m . `` It v i v id ly c re ate s the at m o s p he re of nothing , because the a u th or say s `` so ul `` did not ex is t in s te ad of people .
A fter that , F ur ther m or e , it say s `` but their hu n d r ed s of sh o es , left and right se p ar at ed one from the other `` S h o es , c l o g s , s and al s and s l i p p er s re p re s ent s the e v id ence that hu man was there .

and more we took the l if t to go to the high er place !
that was so n ic e view s ! !
I was re ally sat is f i ed here enough to want not go up !
however we could n t go back so much soon , we de p ar ture d to the to p of the mo un tain ! ! ! !
we are going ha p p i ly first , but the more pro g re s s we made I got hard b re th ing > < .
I thought this was a sign al of al t it ud e sick ness .

Yes ter day a friend of mi ne told me that I must sub m it a paper to get s ch o l ar s h i p of 2 0 1 0 .
I was surprise d because I have never heard that from un i v .
If I would not sub m it a paper , I could not receiv e s ch o l ar s h i p . . . . .
In J a p an , n ation al un ive r s it ies have more money than p ri v ate one s ; di f f er s from one s in U S A .

I ' ve st ud i ed e ng l ish s ever al year s .
but I ' ve only f o c us ed on read ing and listen ing .
for that reason im not good at speak ing and writing .
how can I im p ro ve my speak ing and writing s k i ll s ?
un f or t un ate ly I have no ch ance to talk in e ng l ish .
I ho pe I have a language ex change friend s .
A ll of second gra d e students in my school had been to O k in a w a as a school tri p for three days !
F or ex amp le , we le ar n ed `` B at t le of O k in a w a ( A p ri l , 1 94 5 ) `` happen ed d ur ing W W I I by visit ing O k in a w a .
We went to a bo m b she l ter and listen ed some story from O k in a w a people and visit ed the m us i um .
G ir l s around my age ( 1 3 - 1 8 year s old students ) were for c ed to work as n ur se for in j ur ed so l d i er s in law less are as .
M o st girl s were also di ed .
I think we have to re m e m b er such a s ad story and do something for the pe a ce .
O f course , we also enjoy ed play ing in `` s um m er re s or t `` O k in a w a for other two days ! ! ! ! ! !
We stay ed the hotel which is bu il t along to E a st C h in a S e a , I enjoy ed see ing it , going to walk , having very de l ic i ous dinner and b re a k f a st and talk ing with my friend s unti l mi d night !
I went to one of the most f a m ous e a qu ar i um s in the world , a beautiful sea p ar k and the c at s le in f l u ence d by both C h in a and J a p an a u th or i z ed as a world her it age and so on .
It was very very f un ! ! ! !
. . . I do n ' t want to study for middle turn ex a m s which will begin next F ri day : ' (
I en j o i ed di v ing .
I b ough t them C o ke of than k s .
I could have not po st ed ent ri es re c ent ly because I had a l ot of things to do and the hard s ch ed ul e made me have a head a ch e .
To day , I have not l ot s of things so I can write and I ' m a little b it of ha p p y : D
Well I am w or ri ed about the N e w Z e al and E ar th qu a ke .
It serious ly str u c k off the so u th of the l and .
A new s p a p er also said it was ma g n it ud e 7 .
J a p an of ten has e ar th qu a ke s , though , I have never had such a ho r ri ble one .
I ho pe all of you do not have this e ar th qu a ke at all .
J a p an has many e ar th qu a ke any where .
A c c or in d ing to off ic i al i nformation , Tokyo will be have big e ar th qu a ke
R e c ent ly I started to p re p ar e e v a c u ation e qu i p ment , f o o d , to w el , to i le t t
To day I receiv ed water from ma il or d er comp an y .
As it ' s big v o l um e ( 3 0 can s ) ,
it ' s difficult for me to find keep ing sp a ce .
To day , I j o in ed to L an g - 8 .
In my opinion , this sit e is so great to le ar n second language .
I ho pe you help me le ar n ing English .
S in ce I had to get up at 5 am on 4 N O V , and I was too sleep y last night , I w o ke at 1 am on 5 N O V , there you go !
I past the t est , o h y e a h !
I will get the dr ive r ' s l ic en se after three week s .
A n s w er R A V I ' s question why we became te m p er a ment al the in the meeting is because we are not l o c al people here , we are high s ch o o l class m ate s , we had different co ll e g e in different c ity , and far away from each other .
but f in ally we get to g e ther and work in this c ity , the most e c on o m ic ally a d v ance d c ity in ch in a ma in l and , out home t ow n is 3 th ous and s mi le s from here , and it take s 4 hour s by f light .
We have meeting every two month because we are bu s y on work ing usual ly .
In the other side you know the or i ent al are little con s er v at ive some time s , they con t ro l e m o tion , if something s ad ness happen d , they out of con t ro l , became te m p er a ment al .
It ' s no m al , and un n or m al to you .
I ' ve up d at ed the E m a il S y s te m to day , L O L , I ' ll be more bu s y tomorrow .
A l th ough I have many things to say but I ' m sleep y now , and it ' s too l ate .
This is the first time I us e this sit e .
If you can find any mistake in my di ar y , p le a z e in d ic ate .
Yes ter day , I st ud i ed English to pass the ex a m .
In this month , There is T O E F L t est .
E ver y on e , N ic e to me e t you : )
I ' m ga y o un g .
but My for e i g n er friend s call me by ri y a .
I was give n this name from my in d i an friend : )
I ' m so ha p p y to me e t another country ' s friend s and le ar n their s c ust ome s .
reason why am I le ar n ing English is for tra ve ling and meeting many people .
I believe like that : )
I am so tired , I want ro s l p p ing . . .
I am a st ud ent , I am not study hard but I like study . . .
I like play b as ke t b a ll and I like ex er c is e .
I always go to do ex er c is e with my friend s . . .
I think I can do a good st ud ent . . .
I ' ve sp ent much time alone to day , because my w if e went to her friend ' s w ed d ing part y from S at ur day .
When I got up at 6 : 3 0 , I c le an ed up a living room and a be d room .
I was h ed our c l o th es by our la un d ry two time s , as there are many c l o th es which my w if e and I w or e in the b as ke t .
Then I went to ha ir s al on to have my ha ir c ut , so I feel co m f or t able .
A fter she return ing , we are going to have dinner to g e ther .
I took my b a b y to see my p ar ent s - in - law this morning .
However , I some time s feel a little b it g u il ty for them .
To day I had no p l an , and my b a b y want ed to go out , so f in ally I de c id ed to visit them .
And something bad happen d after tak ing my b a b y to a p ar k with my mother - in - law .
On the way from the p ar k to their house , my mother - in - law d ropped by some her ne i g h b or s , and started y a p p ing .
I know she re ally like s talk ing , and she was re a ly ha p p y to show her gr and k id to her ne i g h b or s .
A t last I was tired of get ting along with her talk .
She prefer s being alone to as s o c i ate with ne i g h b or s .
So that was a sh ock !
I think people had better not dr in k too much like this picture .
To day I went to un ive r s ity , and at ten d ed the G er man class .
A fter st ad y ing , meeting of the sh o d o c l u b .
My ma j or is o il pai n ting .
I took ar t history class .
That was f an .
I w a ke up at 6 : 0 0 A M but I s l ept again .
But such thing does n ' t come off .
My hard effort s are require d now ! !
I study N i h on g g o at J P I st ance for J a p an P h il .
I did n ' t write a di ar y for long long time . . .
M a y b e around 1 y e ar !
A n y way , I went to In d i a and I was stay ing there d ur ing D e ce m b er 2 0 1 0 to M ar ch 2 0 1 1 .
To be honest , around 4 year s a g o , when I s u f f er the some kind of un t re at able dis e a se , I thought that I never go to In d i a again .
B e c a us e that dis e a se at ta c k to st o m a ch .
And there was many difficult sit u ation for me .
I re ally felt s ad and ho pe less mind .
But d ur ing s ever al year s , I could n ' t ga ve up that .
But In d i a has strong at t r a c t ive people s and ex pe ri ence s and view s .
And also In d i a always give s me a strong v it al ity .
That is why I could n ' t ga ve up that .
I re ally a p p re c i ate to that .
The F e b r u ar y is gradua tion sea s on .
A l s o , They str i p p ed gradua te s and d ropped in the sea .
As I see it , it is e m b ar r as s ed .
I am poor .
But I want to ful f i ll my se x u al de s ir es .
How should I do to sat is f y the se con t r ad ic t or y two things .
I may los e all my life for ever .
I wonder if I should take a ri s k . .
tri p ( v i e t n um , g u a m )
D o the all of you go for a tri p f re qu ent ly ?
I of ten go for a tri p .
I have been to V i e t n a m and G u a m in the for e i g n country .
I went to the g ul f of the world her it age in ha n on in V i e t n a m .
I was my s ter i ous and was impress ed .
T h ough I want ed to go to s w im in the c le an sea , I was very s ad .
However , I di v ed , and what I was able to consider a beautiful fish was impress ed .
It was both sp le n d id place s .
I re c o m m en d the se place s .
P r a c t ic e to easy con ver s ation .
is it fine in Tokyo ?
It is s um m er in A ust r al i a now .
It is dark in the room .
It is w ar m here .
It is dinner time .
It is not very w ar m in his room .
In re c ent days I read a b ook <TheUpsideofIrrationality> .
It ' s a re ally a interest ing b ook which close to our da i ly works and st ud ies .
The write r us e a understand able way to i ll ust r ate some e c on o m ic the or ies .
However , it ' s too l ate now .
T h an k you sen d ing me m us ic .
But I c a n ' t listen he ar .
I will listen to go home .
D o you know R ad y G a G a ?
R e c ent ly , I ' m interest ed in `` B e a ut y `` , because my friend go to
the be a ut y school and she always tell s me about co s m etic s , ha ir , and so on .
I went to the be a ut y st ud i o of my friend ' s school .
I got her to have a sha m po o and blow - dr y ! !
I also got her to make up ! !
My friend told that the co s m etic s were so c he e p in K or e a ! !
, so I want to go there and bu y a l ot of good s of f a m ous bra n d s .
F or ex amp le , `` M a c `` , `` L un as or `` , `` R M K `` , and so on ,
A l th ough I live alone , every time when I open ed the va c um m after a per i o d of time , I could see so much d ust inside the va c u um bo x .
I wonder where all the se d ust came from ?
My P C is something wrong
My P C could not bo ot c or re c t ly for a f e w days .
I usual y push re se t bo t ten each time I bo ot my P C .
To day the sound s con ne c ting an a no ter de v ic e to P C ra ng s ud d en ly .
I gradua l ly f e ar .
D o es my machi ne have any comp ut er v ir us ?
O r simpl y hard d is c might have b ro k en ?
A c t u ally , It is the first time for me to in st a ll my P C .
I have been us ing this P C from 2 0 0 4 .
My heart began p ound ing .
F in an c i al c ri s is is coming , as a ch in e se , I have the op p or t un ity as well as the cha ll e ng e , in my opinion , our country have the ch ance to im p ro ve the C o m p re h en s ive n ation al str e ng th , but we also have the str es s on the e c on o m y and so on .
She was ma g ical girl .
She was go ne .
She was k il led by w it ch who name `` C h ar l ot te `` .
She fight to g u ar d her friend s , but C h ar l ot te was very strong .
In it i ally , I think that , she is w i re - p u ll er .
But it is my mistake .
She was not w i re - p u ll er .
M an y people s ad to her de a th .
If w i re - p u ll er is ex is t , it is good who write this st up id s c en ar i o , and us who favor ite and ho pe this st up id s c en ar i o .
G o o d sp e ed M a m i .
I de ce id e writing English b l o g from to day .

D V D is G h o st .

She can see g h o st and talk to him .
It was good for me .
I want to see `` A b at er `` and `` A l ic e `` some day .
D id you see the se mo v i e or D V D ?
I am ha p p y to day because my c l u b meeting was nothing .
It make s me tired ! !
We must think about having a good time for we l c o m ing c l u b me m b er next y es r and so on .
this is why me m b er is very kind and I like do ing call i g r a p h y .
When I w o ke up , S n ow p il ed up th ic k on the gr ound .
so I went to work by tax i .
As soon as I sh o ve l the s n ow with my co ll e a gue .
While I did , J un - s i k th re w s n ow b a ll .

To m or r ow the s n ow do n ' t f e ll .
P o st c ar d s which I had written to my family at S ing a po re ar ri v ed yesterday .
I had kept it se c re t , so my family was surprise d and please d .
I think it is a good idea to write po st c ar d s from the place we go .
I went to Ka w a g o e c ity by b i ke with my w if e and may f re n d s .
We will get to g e ther at 1 1 th a . m . , but my f re n d s came in just no on .
It ' s very de l ic i ous .
This c ity has re m a in s old house s along the street .
We were home at 6 th p . m . .
My w if e was very tired , and she sleep s e ar ly time .
I enjoy sp e ed re s o ling for R u b i k ' s C u b e .
I ' ve been play 2 * 2 , 3 * 3 , 4 * 4 , I want to bu y a 7 * 7 and may be my friend and I will go to sh op p ing and bu y a 7 * 7 R u b i k ' s C u b e .
The follow ing we b s ite have a s im ul at or , it ' s very co o l .

This is a simple s im ul at or and give us some for m ul as .
If you have n ' t a comp ut er but you have a mo b i le , you can us e the s im ul at or was provide d by the follow ing we b s ite .
He ll o ~ ~ E ver y body ! ! I ' m new c ome r in la ng 8 .

c ur r ent ly s er v ing in G un s an 3 8 th fight er ' s W ing as an a ir m en first class .
very interest ing in how to speak f l u ent ly and write sp on ta ne ous ly in English .
My re c ent ho b b y is pai n ting picture
I like to pai n t a picture .
D a y before yesterday , I b ough t a draw ing paper , pai n ting b r us he s and water co l or s .
When I pai n t a picture , I can de v o te it and for g e t everything .
My hu s b and ' s friend sen t us a who le of c re a m c he e se and str a w b er ry c a ke .
This is from the f a m ous c a ke sh op in H o k k a id o which is the no r th part of J a p an .
The sh op is f a m ous for c he e se c a ke .
They o c c as ion ally run a te m p or ar i ly sh op in the de p ar t ment st or es in Tokyo , but we c a n ' t usual ly bu y it in Tokyo .
That ' s why it is va l u able , however my d aught er s do n ' t like c a ke s and my hu s b and do n ' t like c a ke s with a f la v or of str a w b er ry .
We took the less on in this morning .
It was two story .
One was a c re a m c he e z e la y er which was he a v y , the other was a str a w b er ry la y er which was sweet - and - so ur .
S t ud y is hard when you have to for ce your s el f .
When you ha te do ing something you just stop do ing it .
That ' s why you have to or g in i z e your work so that it would be co m f or t able for you .
I tri ed many way s to study English .
I read te x t b ook s , which was us e ful but b or ing .
I le ar n ed un k n ow n w or d s from a di ction ar y , which was a d u ll o c c up ation .
I tri ed some more things unti l I understood that I like read ing b ook s most of all .
I le ar n them and th r ow the she e t .
If I for g e t a w or d I write it down and le ar n it again .
I think that too much i nformation does n ' t help .
I went out with my s is ter for dr i v ing to day ,
I de c id ed to make a ne c k less us ing p ow er stone s .
I us ed some stone s which have a p ow er of he al ing .
The de s s ar t I had was so good ! !
I think b re ad s and mi l k in the U K might be more de l ic i ous than that of J a p an .
So , F r ance is may b e very n ic e country in terms of b re ad .
To day , I part ed from my girl friend .
B e c a us e She has an im p or t ant dr e a m .
It is hard for her because She has to e ar n a l ot of money and has to study hard er and hard er .
I talk ed about dr e a m each other .
It is be st way for us to b re a k up and con s ent r ate to our dr e a m .
So we de c id ed to part from .
B e f or e get to train , I am not s ad because I can not believe .
A fter get back home , I am so s ad because I not ic e she does n @ t call , sen d E - ma il , talk by s k y pe any m or e .
I he s it ate we ther dis po se her present , ke y hold er or not .
No w I can do we b s ur f ing with this p h on e which I ve been want ed most .
But not get ting a c c ust ome d to yet , I know just f e w f un ction s of this .
One of that I feel un c o m f or t able is writing J a p an e se .
I found an a p p l ic ation that make s it possible , writing J a p an e se is still not easy .
I can not make c or re ction s through a p h on e but leave a commen t .
I c aught a co l d and have a run n ing no se .
It was ra in ing so hard ly so there is some trouble to go to se p ul ch er .
The ra in stop p ed but it s so ch il ly here .
No w I have to go to visit my un c le s .
To m m or r ow is H o l i day ! !
But to m m or r ow is go ne , It ' ll go n n a be start hard s ch ed ul e !
D o n ' t G ive up ! !
Y o g a R e - start
L a st year , I us ed to do y o g a for about three month s every morning and every night .
I ha e a y o g a v o d f i le in my la p t op .

It is almost one month since I w ro te my last j o ur n al .
My In ter ne t line had a trouble 3 week s a g o and it was change d about 2 week s a g o , and then I had an end - of - ter m ex a m in ation last week , so I had no time .
F in ally I got time to write a di ar y and am so ha p p y !
But this year I have only 1 year ti ll my un ive r s ity ' s entrance ex a m , so I have to sp en d my w in ter va c ation study ing bu s i ly , but I ho pe I w o n ' t los e time to p r a c t ic e my English .
No w , we re ally worry about the F u ku s h im a n u c le ar p ow er p l ant s dis aster .

In this time , the big c ri s is come to th re a ten .
I b ough t a pai r of g l o ve s on last C h ri st m as .
They do not full y co ver ed my f ing er s .
The day before yesterday I went out , I felt ch il ly I want ed to us e the g l o ve s , but I could find only one of the g l o ve s from my b a g .
I was look ing for the other one at t ent ive ly , looked into the b a g care ful ly , turn ed back to c he c k on the gr ound , but I f a il d to find it .
I s n ' t that your s , is it ? `` I ga ve him a w in n er point again .
My hu s b and O K ?
My hu s b and has tru st ed and to re ly on his bo s s , so he has in charge of l ot .
The day before yesterday , I think he had big pro ble m s .
He never say comp la in s for me .
He look like fine to be h aving for me , but he was not a p pe t ite and in be d , to have a night m ar e .
I ' m very worry ing , so I want to help something to him .
A n y way , I should do ing smile as usual right ?
I like A m er ic an so a p dr a m as .
On S at ur day s I watch H ER O E S on T V .
I watch ed mo v i e S A T C .
I was very ex cited it .
I b ough t a sound tra c k C D .
I am a w ome n who will hi t s 3 0 just right behind me .
T im e could help you to he al when you get pai n from l o ve and also could b r ing l o ve to you in a moment .
P e op le always s c ar ed to get into l o ve because they do n ' t know that l o ve will be last very long or just a moment to end up with pai n but I never be afraid to take that ri s k .
We only have one life , why have to make it that difficult .
F or me , if one day I have to di e , I will di e but my l o ve still with some on e that I l o v ed .
P o s it ive l o ve always make s you ' re ha p p y no matter what people did to you .
It ' s the be st way for life .
le ar n ing e ng l ish
I had le ar n t it when I was a st ud ent .
And I of ten read the for e i g n re p or t s to I m p ro ve my English .
I was bu y a le ar n ing so f t w ar e on F e b r u ar y .
W h i ch is your ha p p in est moment in life ? W or k a h o l ic guy .
I ' m work a h o l ic guy .
My ha p i p in est moment in my life is the moment when I ar ch ive something in my work ing .
F or ex a p m le , I feel ha p p y when I took a s al es a w ar d in my work p la ce or I feel ha p p y when c ust ome r give me per f e c t s c or e by c ust ome r ' s s ur b e y .
I like my job as a s al es person because I can con t ri b ut e the c ust ome r ' s bu s s i ness .
I ' m re ally ha p p y when I got a con t r a c t and c ust ome r is going to be sat is f i ed by our s er v ic e .
My friend call me `` M r .
M an y J a p an e se ha te to work all day but I do n ' t even know what an `` a p p ro p ri ate `` work ing time .
J a p an e se la b or law say s 8 h o ur s work ing time is a p p ro p ri ate but I feel like the se of de f in i tion s and pocket s no long er ex is t .
And those tra d i tion al de f in i tion s in work p la ce r ul e , I do n ' t think a p p ly any m or e in the future .
So , It would be better to feel ha p p y by ar ch i v ing something even if you need to work very hard .
W or k ing very hard is a J a p an e se c ul ture and we can feel our ha p p in est when we de v o te our s el ve s to w ar d c ust ome r ' s success .
V a c ation is im p or at n t act u ally , but for me , work ing hard is more im p or t ant .
I certain ly ho pe that my work is a b ri d g e between va ri ous a p p ro a ch es with in new g en er ation ' s work ing style and I ho pe they feel ha p p y through the work .
T ow ar d T O E I C s c or e 6 0 0
I us ed to us e English , but now hard ly us e English .
There f or e I afraid whether I can re c o ver my English ability .

So she has two n ation al it ies I s r a el and A m er ic a .
I c a n ' t believe .
She is so in te ll i g ence .
I think many J e w is very s m ar t .
F or the reason that . . .

As for all the person s are le ar n er , some time s we can t find our mistake , act u ally we can not re al i z e it at all .
B e c a us e we are all ch in e se n at ive , no any English n at ive .
My C o ll e age L if e ~ ~
When I ' m coming to think back about the life since I first stepped on my co ll e age , I re ally felt that I have gr ow n up .
I ma j or in J p an e se which is suppose d to be a time - con s um ing sub j e c t .
A t the begin n ing of co ll e age life , I consider ed to take part in some c l u b s , and then I f il led some for m s to hand in .
In the mean time I got some new people which became my be st friend s la ter .
R e f er to friend s , I need to say that they ' re re ally im p or t ant to me on my ro ad .
They ' re all old er than me so I of en re c i e ve us e ful help s from them , I ' d be gr ate ful to it .
A fter I got us ed to co ll e age life , in the place which is full of cha ll e ng es I had begin n ing to think of how to b al ance the time be t w e e en study and life .
l ot s time and insist ing on ever day .
No w it seemed short age of time .
My ma j or teachers said that it ' s better to conc ent r ate my at ten tion on my study if I ' m not too f as c in at ed with any other act i v it ies .
So I ch o o s ed my ma j or .
But it did n ' t mean that I have a b and on ed all of my co l or ful act i v it ies .
On the follow ing , I had at ten d ed a J a pe ne se S pe e ch C on t est and I w on a p ri z e .
It give s l ot s of con f id ence on study to me .
S in ce the co ll e age life began I first k on w n that success is on my side .
And from now on I will try my be st to be a s u c ce ed co ll e age st ud ent no matter how many difficult ies come s .
We had a time to do our gradua tion re se ar ch to day .
There are three time s a week .
The t est week will start from the two days after tomorrow .
But , I p re p ar ed for my re se ar ch .
This week , I have many t est s .
I want to get high s c or es , but It ' s very hard for me .
If this t est week will end , the sp r ing va c ation will come soon .
Then I want to dr ive r s l is ence .
why t al ent ed people is la z y
But as I know myself , I am very t al ent ed man .
D es p ite my life position , I have an other c a p able too .
But I do not us e it at least in my free time .
F or ex amp le , I have good m us ic feel ing and I can play three m us ic in st r u ment .
You can say every body have this c a p able or you can say every body could have this t al ent .
But different from other s I have in b or n ability .
When I play some of m us ic in st r u ment , people s first question was , where did you ed u c at ed , or how did you get this ability .
When I say , I gradua ted no m us ic school , and I have no m us ic education , they surprise d .
My other t al ent is pai n ting , which first hand w or k was my father p or t r a it when I was in 1 3 - 1 4 year s old .
My c ous in is pro f es s ion al ar t is t , and he pai n ting at the go ver n ment al le ve l .
Why I say this , because this person va l u ed my first and serious ly hand w or k .
I pro ud of my s el f at this time , because pro f es s ion al ar t is t ga ve me such a high va l u e .
No w I am so la z y , I could not make free time to con t in u e and to present ed my hi d d en t al ent .
I am a ng ry at myself , because of do not having d ur able course of English at least here in this help ful sit e , and by the help of my good teacher S ar a h u .
A ll kind s of things is coming from the sea .
But the p ow er of the s un made everything change d .
I think there is many kind s of co l o ur in the life .
So we should l o ve our life .
When I ' m free .
S u ch as draw ing , de s i g n ing and do the things which other s never do .
I think my me m er y is too bad , so I do n ' t like to re m e m b er w or d s .
The day before yesterday , I try to re m e m b er the English w or d s .
A t the first , I feel that it was difficult for me .
But after re m e m b er ed a f e w w or d s , I knew how to do it by easy way and I feel it is a good work .
D a y before yesterday , I c he c k ed a we a ther for e c a st .
I was ha p p y to he ar that because co l d days had been con t in u ing .
When I w o ke up yesterday , I looked outside the w in d ow s on ti p t op , but it was ra in ing . . .
B e c a us e of that , I knew I must not tru st we a ther for e c a st s .
I did n ' t sleep enough at last night
I did n ' t sleep enough at last night ( not only last night .
What are you do ing when you do n ' t sleep ?
Some people co un t the she e p unti l being possible to sleep in be d .
A l s o , I ' m read ing a b ook , watch ing a T V , and play ing a game .
M o st V is u al K e i f an s , B an g a ( B an g y a ? ) , we ar s go th ic p un k or l o l it a c l o th es , and I we ar those kind s of c l o th es .
I write to sh ot story of `` To u h o u pro j e c t `` .
D o you know `` To u h o u pro j e c t `` ?
It is `` O ta ku `` ho b b y .
I like `` To u h o u pro j e c t `` very much .
So , I have write to short story of it since a year a g o .
If you interest ed in `` To u h o u pro j e c t `` , P le a se access this ur l .
I sp ent the who le day la z ing around at home , which is the very ty p ical way of pass ing a ho l i day !

To day I ' ve got some l o ve ly p l an s so I c a n ' t wait to get up and start a day !
: )
I ' m us ing for study English .
I will watch mo v i e to no sub t it le .
S c i ence can give only a limit ed answer for this kind of question s .
It has been long believe d that gra v it ation is an at t r a c t ive for ce which at t r a c t s ma s se s each other .
A ccord ing to this the or y , when there is a ma s s ( or e qu i v al ent ly en er g y ) at some point , sp a ce and time around it are c ur v ed by the p re s ence of it .
And la ter , the ex p an s ion of the un ive r se was dis c o ver ed act u ally .
A t the very begin n ing of the un ive r se , everything includ ing us was being pack ed in one point .
In fact , more than 9 5 per c ent of the comp on ent s of the un ive r se are un k n ow n one s , `` dark en er g y `` and `` dark matter `` .
I w an n a let people know about my way of think ing , thought s and person al ity and so on .
I think that if people ho pe to bu il d good re l ation s h i p s with other s , they have to talk about va ri ous things and take much time for talk ing .
In J a p an e se , I can talk about a l ot of to p ic s serious ly and some time s make people laugh at with funny st or ies .
But my le ve l of English does not re a ch to be able to express myself per f e c t ly .
I usual ly feel str es se s .
I believe this feel ing of a ng ry will make me better .
I found it in the b ook which is called M o m o , an G er man f ant as y no ve l .
The qu ot ation from M o m o is :
Some time s , when you ' ve a very long street a head of you , you think how ter ri b ly long it is and feel sure you ' ll never get it s w ept ;
And that ' s how it ough t to be .
If the t est is coming up a b it
I re ally do not want to eat again
This s um m er I will never eat noodle s
I re c ent ly became h ook ed on C y w or l d
I want to see some friend s to come my way l ate ly .
The se days are so in s en st ive , la ng - 8
I will work hard next
D o es J a p an has a enough to l er ance ?
The a u th or is R i ch ar d F l or id a who is p rofessor of the U n ive r s ity of T or on t o .
He insist s on a new ty pe of hu man re s o ur ce str ate g y is need ed that is f o c us es on hu man ' s c re at i v ity .
P e op le who is have c re at i v ity is , for in st ance , e ng in e er , s c i ent is t , ar t is t s , an a ly st , law y er , do c t or , e t c . .
Why he e m p ha s i z e on hu man ' s c re at i v ity is that they c re ate 3 0 % of the who le a c c um ul at ed we al th in A m er ic a .
The ra t i o is gr ow er and gr ow er .
So , the s us tain able e c on o m ic gr ow th depend s on it .
That ten d en c y is also in a ccord ance with J a p an .
A ccord ing to the a u th or , the e le ment s for e c on o m ic de ve l op ment in 2 1 c ent ur y is te ch no l o g y , t al ent , to l er ance .
E s pe c i ally , he put e m p ha s is on to l er ance .
B e c a us e , unless there is much enough to l er ance , hu man re s o ur ce who are c re at ive do n ' t want to come or stay to the are a .
And now I wonder whether J a p an has a to l er ance enough or not .
It is probab ly not enough by now .
( I just stop writing for a moment .
My name is k on a .

The b a b y who like s only y o g ur t made me c ry .
I los t my mind to the b a b ies when they smile at me or try to hold my hand with their l o ve ly small f ing er s .
She was asked to take care of a b a b y .
She thought it should be easy .
The b a b y re f us ed everything but the s u g ar d y o g ur t and then the little s c ar y f r in ed b ur st ed out c ry ing , my friend said .
I have a same ex p er ence act u ally , so I could understand to t ally how much she was e m b ar r s s ed .
She asked me to take care her ch il d re n .
I was comp le te ly f r ust r at ed because of her .
O f course I was in another room at the moment .

I felt g u i ly so I hu g g ed him for a while .
My n i e ce stop ed c ry ing .
The sit u ation what the mother of b a b ies saw seemed pe a c ful and per f e c t .
No body c ri ed .
I was ly ing on the floor of living room hold ing her b a b ies when she came back home .
She told me that her b a b ies must had have been good and sweet while she was not at home because her ch il d re n were good and they l o v ed me .
`` You never know what happen d !
You have to know how much your little da u ther was st b b or n ! ! !
It ` s the most difficult job to take care a b a b y who insist es to eat only y o g ur t .
B e f or e I had my bo y , I had n ' t been interest ed in po ll s and po l it ic s .
I did n ' t even go to the po ll s .

It ' s kind of cha ll e ng ing for me because the on line sh op is only English .
To day I receiv ed two b a g s in the picture s from E ng l and .

If I can understand English , it would be possible for me to be able to bu y many things from on line sh i p s which is only English .
To tell you to the tru th , we can bu y a l ot of things of C a th K id st on in J a p an .
I also can bu y ra re things which I c a n ' t get in J a p an .
I think that for va ri ous reason s , but there is a very funny reason .

We are going to talk about a to p ic .
I now have a b l o g ! How ex c it ing !
My name is B ad r , I ' m a 1 8 year old guy from M or o c c o .
English is n ' t my n at ive language however I re ally would like to become a f l u ent speak er because I might study in an English speak ing country after I gradua te from H i g h - S ch o o l and I also re ally a p p re c i ate this language .
I ' m ha p p y I found this we b s ite because I can know p r a c t ic e my written English .
M e an w h i le I could try to help you out with my n at ive language , F re n ch !
R e c ent ry , I ' m into D I Y .
A c t u ally , I was n ' t interest ed in D I Y before I made the c age for my pe t , l i z ar d .
A fter that , I knew how f un ma k ing something with w o o d .
No w , I ' m ma k ing H an g er ra c k for my room .
I ho pe it would be good f ur n i ture .
F i g ur ing out a very im p or t ant think for my so n .
I have been s u f f er ing since last O c t o b er , because my so n was n ' t sleep well in night .

It was so co l d for him , so he could n ' t sleep well .
I the new c ome r .
I have friend s who m I very much l o ve and a d or e .
There is which guy I very strong ly l o ve .
B o y f ri en d of my s y s ter has sen t me an in v it ation for this on line game .
When I started play ing I feel it too b or ing , because I has play ing T r a v i en before , and it was an even t ful game .
Yes ter day morning a have re ed the F A Q of the game , and a get to understand the be a ut y of it .
There is w o o d and other four l u x u ar y ma ter i al in the other is l and s , so you can b r ing just one of them .
There is re se ar c , where you can in v ent new bu l id ing s and other ex t r as , there are go d s ( this is a an c i ent G re e k game ) , you can at ta c k other play er s , and bu l id new co l on ies in other is l and s , so you need to bu y sh i p s , and bu l il d b at t le s h i p .
If you feel you want to play , I can sen d an invite tion to the hung ar i an serve r s ' L a m b d a ' and ' My ' : )
and I ' m new person on la ng - 8 , I ho pe I can find some friend who can tea ch me some la ng u an g es , and of c ous e c or re ction my e ng l ish .
than k you . .
E s pe c i ally while work ing , I would got in trouble .
A c t u ally I work for a c la m school .
One day may b e about half a year a g o I have hu r t one of my students in my class because of what I said .
O f course I had not expect ed that happen ed at all .
As you can im a g in e , the st ud ent made a dis t ance between us after that .
Then I started to think like I have to take great care of what I ' m saying so that I do n ' t hu r t any students any more .
But that made me very a w k w ar d to talk to them .
There f or e those were not my w or d .
F in ally , I con s ul ted my B o s s .
He game me some piece s of a d v ic e .
T h o se made me feel so re l i e v ed .
I ' ve st ud i ed English for a long time , more than 1 0 year s .
however , I ' m un able to speak it f l u ent ly now .
that is re ally a sh ame .
So , I have been see k ing the go al to study it .
If I find a go al , it will give me an ur g e to study much hard er .
If I will be the one , I must take respon s i b il ity for that .
T e a ch ing something to some on e , teacher must be s c r up ul ous and p at i ent .
I ' m a la z y person , so I have to give it a try !
He ll o , every on e .
I ' ve just sign ed in L an g - 8 to day .
S in ce I want to im p ro ve my writing as pe c t I will be work ing hard on writing j o ur n al s on the we b s ite .
I ' m require d to write a business letter or an e - ma il te x t to my im a g in ar y friend on the t est .
There f or e I will ma in ly us e L an g - 8 in or d er to do my writing for the part of the English pro f ic i en c y t est for a while .
I will po st the t est as s i g n ment s on t o my j o ur n al s and re p ly to those .
It has been a long long time since I w ro te an English ar t ic le last time .
No w when I try to say something in English , J a p an e se always come s first , al th o u g t I still c a n ' t us e J a p an e se f l u ent ly .
I s this about `` In er t i a `` ?
We have le ar n ed English for more than ten year s , but I wonder if I can con m un ic ate with an English n at ive speak er s m o o th ly .
Well , though I ' m le ar n ing J a p an e se now , I ' m afraid it will turn out the same with English le ar n ing at last .
So I am con f us ed now .
I know it ' s bad , but it ' s hard to put it right .
T h ough It ' s S ud d en
I c a n ' t write a j o ur n al ent ry for around 2 week s .
The thing is , as you may know , I ' ll mo ve to a new place where is a little near er than where I ' ve live d .
No w I ' m p re p ar ing for the mo v ing to come : c le an ing , pack ing or so .
When I go back to my p ar ent ' s house , I will re st ar t writing j o ur n al s !
This time last year , I was in O re g on S t ate in the United States .
I felt that O re g on S t ate has beautiful nature and kind people !
The picture of my pro f i le was also take n when I was in O re g on .
T h ough I went there for study ing English for a month , I enjoy ed sight se e ing and play ing sp or t s with my friend s .
I think my English has become good since then .
I explain it simpl y .
F ir st , ch op a c a b b age .
M i x ch op p ed c a b b age , a c up of w he at f l o ur and a c up of water to make it f l o ur - th ic k en ed .
P ut mi x ture on he at ed p an and sp re ad it th in like p i z z a .
P an - f ry it unti l the s ur f a ce get s light ly b ur n ed .
And then turn it over to p an - f ry it s op po s ite side as same .
I saw ta ng led without sub t it le for study e ng l ish .
I can he ar some of speak but I also c a n ' t he ar some of speak .
I ho pe I can see the ta ng led without sub t it le per f e c t ly .
L a st two week s I have d some un e x pe c ted free l ance work , so I tri ed to re m e m b er some im p or t ant hot ke y s in C or el D r a w and P h ot o s h op , that s why I ' m here just now .
A c t u ally , in my n at ive c ity , it mean s what I p re p ar e for p u b l ish ing other de s i g n er ' s works , and some time s I have to c re ate something by myself .
U s u ally it is something like f o o d la b el s , not too comp le x and c re at ive .
F ur ther m or e , also the C h ri st m as is in the w in ter and it is right around the corner , A l th ough it is n ' t a ho l i day in T a i w an , but most people like this f est i v al since it make us feel ing w ar m from the inside .
In the past , I usual ly went to re st a ur ant to ce le b r ate the C h ri st m as , but I have no idea this year .
M an y sh op s have se ll re l at ive pro d u c t s of C h ri st m as , also I have no idea to p re p ar e the g if t of C h ri st m as .
This is my first day to write di ar y .
I am a st ud ent at language school at the U S A .
My teacher told me I should write some sen t ence every day .
My le ve l is l ow er in ter m id i ate .
P le a se c he c k my sen t ence .

Yes ter day , I went to an It al i an re st a ur ant with my w if e and my K or i an friend s who are a co up le .
E ver y on e of us can speak English not so good , but funny thing is we could co m m un ic ate very s m o o th ly because the pro no un c i ation of English my K or i an friend s speak was more easy to listen than n at ive A m er ic an one .
M is ta ke s my K or i an friend s made were very similar to mi ne such as ten se and s ing l ar / p l ur al .
We J a p an e se some th im es feel e m b ar r as s ing to hu g when gr e e ting with A m er ic an s .
So I felt very co m f or t able to ha ng out with K or e an friend s .
I went to V id e o G ame s L ive in J a p an on 2 2 , S ept e m b er .
V id e o G ame s L ive ( V G L ) is a conc er t even t f e at ur ing m us ic from the p op ul ar v id e o game s .
They he l d the even t at many c it ies of the world ex c ept Tokyo .
This is the first time that they play the v id e o game m us ic in J a p an .
The perform ance was started with a funny short f il m that act or s who put on a `` P A C K M A N `` ' s co st um e play ed cha s ing .

H is well know n works are C h ro no T ri g g er , C h ro no C ro s s , X en o g e ar s .
C h ro no T ri g g er and C ro s s me d le y was also f ant a st ic .
That ' s because the con d u c t or , J a c k play the g u it er with the s y m p h on y .
U n b el i e v able but so ex ce ll ent .
When the perform ance finish ed , the a ud i ence b ur st into ent h us i a st ic a p p la us e .
I ho pe that they come back J a p an .
un e x pe c ted ly , I me t a bo y who came back from P e k ing just before .
He always say that I should p r a c t ic e J a p an e se more when I am in J a p an , because it ' s hard to find a J a p an se s to p r a c t ic e with you in T a i w an .
There are but in the c r a m school .

My bo y f ri en d in J a p an is a quite and in a c t ive .
He is just the op po s ite of me too .
We do n ' t have a co m m on interest .
My friend some time as k me .
I talk ed everything to him .

He usual ly did n ' t say his opinion ex c ept im p or t ant pro ble m .
We are still be st friend .

I have n ' t written any ent ry for two month s ! ! !
I for g e t English .
It is two month s too after I came back from A ust r al i a .
I ' ve been to A ust r al i a only e i g h t month s .
just a person al opinion
We just thought w ed d ing s in C h ri st i an ch ur ch es ro man t ic and act u ally it was wonder ful for us .
My p ar ent s are B ud d h is t s , in while my w if e ' s p ar ent s are believe r s in S h in t o , but no ne of them have en f or c ed us to believe in their re l i g ion s .
O f course , I always keep serious ly o b s er v ing the r ul es state d at the sit e , while visit ing them .
I ' m respect ful for re l i g ion s and interest ed in them .
I go to don ate b l o o d re g ul ar ly and I always feel ha p p y and pe a ce ful after that because I think I could do something good for some on e .
Yes ter day I came up with that kind of thing , while g i v ing b l o o d on the be d , al th ough I know un f or t un ate ly it ' s im po s s i ble for some re l i g ion s to a d m it b l o o d don ation .
I believe every on e should become to l er ant to accept conc ept of va l u es from different re l i g ion s , and I ho pe my be ha v i or s and thought s about re l i g ion s never hu r t any on e .
F ro m now on , I ' d like to to u ch different c ul ture s close ly re la ted with any re l i g ion s more and more .
L A S I K e y e s ur g er y which is us ed c or re c t people ' s v is ion and end their need for their g la s se s or con ta c t l en se s start to sp re ad in J a p an .
I had s ur g er y and re c o ver ed my eyes i g h t .

The ra n k ing is de c id ed by my go n z o , and some on e who too much speak ing about b l u e j o ke s in my L a b re c ent ly ra n k s in it .
A fter my S E N P A I gradua ted from my L a b , sit u ation in room is im p ro v ed , but it become s difficult for me to de c id e the ra n k ing .
R e c en ly , I will de c id e to try a long ter m in ter n s h i p .

I heard that people in for e i g n co un t ri es have great in ter ent in in ter n s h i p .
I am J a p an e se students , but I think that most of the J a p an e se students do n ' t have much e age r ness than other co un t ri es .
I am worry about this sit u ation .
I wonder if this sit u ation change .
We went to watch ten n is to ur n a ment s of The N ation al A th l etic M e e t in N a g a o k a .
The to ur n a ment s were tea m comp e t i tion s , two s ing le s and a do u ble s .

F or our c a p it al is m life , many people are un a c c ust ome d to the p re s s ur e of mo d er n life .
If some on e could n ' t accept that p re s s ur e around their life also they have been feel ing down and s ad for a long time , they probab ly have got me l an ch o l i a .
It ' s a good way for ar t the r a p y be s id es see a p s y ch i at ri st or cha t with p s y ch o l o g is t s .

W a it ed all students have finish ed works , then teacher asked us sh ar ing person al pai n ting with each other .
T al k ing about ar t the r a p y that has a l ot of way s could help in v al id s , I re m e m b er once our teacher asked us to us e the tri ch ro m at ic for pai n ting s .
I have went to ar t and dance the r a p y class es before , al th ough da n c ing is always number one in my heart , but I thought the ar t the r a p y has more interest ing than dance the r a p y .
We could understand different person al it ies by co l or s for every on e us ed .
M a y b e was v i v id , s ad , or a ha p p i ness feel ing .
Some time s co l or s like a co m m on language that express our e m o tion s .

Some people regard s it as s w e ar m us ic as there are too many s w e ar w or d s .
But is it re ally like this ?
I do n ' t want to de n y those way to re la x .
The life is so b it ter and short so do n ' t str i ke your con f id ence .
The life should be was ted on beautiful things .
A n y way I am so tired this week .
It ' s difficult to w a ke up e ar ly in the morning but I have to do .

M or e o ver , by do ing this re se ar ch , we found a way to find an a p p ro p ri ate person , found a way to re c o m m en d an a p p ro p ri ate ro ut e , found some f e a ture p at ter n s of as k ing for help .
U s u ally , we visit there by c ar , but this time I ch o se a b ic y c le to go because it was a wonder ful day .
A fter the class , we went to a p ar k for having a l un ch there as I had p re p ar ed our bo x l un ch es .

Yes ter day , I de c id ed to write a di ar y in English from to day .

But I start it from to day .
It ' s been a long time since I have n ' t written anything here .

What I can do is to study hard and have f un with my friend s as much as possible .
A st up id guy was s m o k ing we ed at the ha ll way at school .
The teacher told that my d aught er is not good at saying the m ul t i p ul ation of 3X 8 and 2 X6 .
But how about a tra ve l through time ?
A l th ough the se new it e m s make our live s co m f or t able , we can not get back to the er a that no one had his / her own P C and ce ll p h on es .
A t that time we had to wait e ter n ally for some on e we a p po in ted to me e t if s / he got s ud d en ly into trouble .
My so n who is 9 year s old do n ' t like don ing home w or k .
U s ally he has 3 ~ 4 as s i g n ment s in a day .
It ' ll take about 1 hour if he can f o c us on his work .
But most ly it took for him 2 or 3 hour s so almost every day I ' ve s c o l d ed him for ne g le c ting his home w or k .
To day was another hard day because of his as s i g n ment s .
I re ally want to qu it this fight .
D o es the day ar r ive ?

I want to be a good speak er in English and C h in e se , so I will try to keep a da i ly in the se language s .
I was k il led by the re d mo n s ter
This po st is written about F F X I V , which is the game on line .
O f course , I could n ' t go alone , so we made a part y with 8 person s .
They at ta c k ed us one after another .
We re a ch ed the in n er m o st f in ally ,
but the re d mo n s ter in this picture appeared in front of us .
We were k il led in st ant an e ous ly .
I ' m going to try again , then I ho pe we w in it .
I watch ed E v an g el ion to night for first time .
This is more gr ot es qu e than I im a g in ed from so ng D V D pack age or so .

My work is c ook ing with a l ot f o o d , ve g e t able s , me at .

I have to wait to know the re s ul t unti l about M a y .
On ho l i day , I usual ly go to re st a ur ant for think ing good ta s te .
I have th o u g t new ta s te good that do n ' t se ll in J a p an .
So , I go to for e i g n re st a ur ant near Y o k o ha m a .

But when I go any where f o o d , I feel dis g ust ed , n a us e ous some h ow .

Ya m a o k a is one of character s in J a p an e se co m ic `` O ish in b o `` , and I have called by my friend s from my under g r ad u ate days because I am similar to him .
I of ten go through o ut J a p an on business tri p , and look for w ar d to try the l o c al f o o d s even now .
And so , I have to study some for i e g n la ng a u g es .
I can not watch and write here every day , but I will con t in u e to study .
( M a y b e every on e must con t in u e to study d ur ing our life , not only about language . )
B y the way , my w if e study G er man , and has written her di ar y on we b .
If you have in ter re st ing in c ook ing and study ing G er man , read it , please .
She sen t us a well - made J a p an e se n a il c ut ter this time because she went to J a p an last week for va c ation .
He r va c ation is sp on s or ed by our comp an y .
He r ha ir is b r us h ed to a n ic e style .
A c t u ally , she look s more beautiful than the usual time .
But every body keep s quiet to day and look s for w ar d to her or d er s .
A ll of us seemed to enjoy a who le week free d o m without the s up er v is ion of my bo s s .
She is a serious person and very t ough on require ment of our work .
A g if t is always n ic e to every on e , I think .
G e t ty c ent er
I went to a m us e um , G e t ty c ent er in L A .
That is l o c at ed on the to p op the hi ll where we can enjoy p an or a m ic view of L A .
The way to there is enjoy able .
The second is the pro g r a m s by the m us e um includ ing from a walk ing to ur to a le c ture of the draw ing , in ten d ing from kid s to sen i or s .
My family were in the re st a ur ant when it began to ra in .
I re ally like to watch the mo v i e .
There are H o l ly w o o d , J a p an e se , k or e an , e t c . . .
R e c ent ly I have a l ot of time so I have been watch ing them .
One of the reason that I study English , I want to watch without c a p tion .
But it ' s compli c at ed for me . . .
any way I watch ed a mo v i e ti t led `` C l o s er `` .
I thought about L o ve .
It some time s dis t r a c t s then we can gr ow up more and more .
I want ed to write my opinion but I give up to day .
On F ri day , I twist ed my left an k le when run n ing .
I did n ' t thought my bo ne was b ro k en , but it was so hu r t .
Yes ter day I went to see do c t or .
My ho l i day ' s p l an n ing has go ne , but I got a ch ance not only
My d aught er is one year and the r r month s .
R e c ent ly , she began to walk .
So , I b ough t sh o es for her .
When we ar ing the sh o es to her , she c ri ed al o ud and tri ed to re m o ve the sh o es .
To we ar the sh o es is strange for her , I g us s .
I ho pe she get us ed to we ar ing sh o es gradua l ly .
I could n ' t write di ar y d ur ing a week because I was bu s y .
I had to go to c l u b of me n ' s ch or us .
But I try to keep writing this di ar y and j o in ing to c l u b act i v it ies .
You may think it mean s `` U p p er c la s s m en will ent er tain fresh man s `` , in fact , it mean s `` F re s h man s will ent er tain U p p er c la s s m en `` ! !
I and my class m ate s ra n a bo o th of H ash im a k i .
H ash im a k i is similar to O k on o m i y a k i which is rolled around a ch op st ic k s .
I stay ed the night at my friend house for p re p ar ing .
I sat up the night to ch op the c a b b age s . . .
The s c al e of the f est i v al was big g er than the one of high school .
We e k end !
It was n ic e to sleep a l ot on sat ur day .
No w I ' m I feel ing I have re ch ar g ed en er g y ! ! !
In the after no on , I did my l and ry , b a k ed m u f f in , and st ud i ed for the t est which I w ro te about on this di ar y yesterday .
I ' m going to go to be d e ar i er to day , and w o ke up at 4 : 3 0 as usual tomorrow , p re p ar ing for the begin ing of the next w e e k .
S le e p ing a l ot , w a k ing up l ate on sat ur day , w a k ing up as e ar ly as week days on s un day . . .
I think I can keep good ri th m for my life s ty le this way .
In J a p an every terms before end , you will have talk f est .
I first know my you ng est so n do n ' t c le an up in the kind er g ar ten .
If he did n ' t c le an up in our house , I will b ar k ed at him .
My de ar so n , you must listen every body .
I like draw ing by a bo o l po in t p en
When I was ch il d , I us e bo o l po in t p en for draw ing .
So The bo o l po ing p en is us e ful for me .
What I think de e p ly the se day s
I ' m a so p h o m or e st ud ent , so I will have to de c id e my life before long .
I see I ' m in c a p it al is m so c i e ty , however , I do n ' t have mo t i v ation enough to do job hu n ting next year .
I want ed to do something good for so c i e ty .
But comp an y is n ' t so now .
I want to se ll v ir t u ous mind again , and want to im p ro ve it can do .
So , I made a comp an y de al ing with re c y c le pro d u c t s . ``
I thought `` it ' s answer to me ! `` I have consider ed whether I should work as `` a do g of c a p it al is m `` , but his commen t ga ve me new idea .
I do n ' t have to work for comp an y .
I can make comp an y which I think it is good for so c i e ty if I want .
I may also as well work at comp an y once , I will re t i re when I a c qu i re business s k i ll s enough , then I will make comp an y or something like that .
S or ry for too long !
But now , it ' s us ed for sen i or high school b a se b a ll to ur n a ment .
They never get p ri z e or pay , even if they w in a ch amp ion s h i p .
N ever th e less , they p r a c t ic e b a se b a ll very hard .
They fight in a to ur n a ment , so if they los t a game , they c a n ' t fight again .
So they become ha p p y or s ad every game .
T h an you for read ing .
If you finish ed a mi d ical co ll ed g e you have to be able to di a g no se this case .
I think it ' s a good idea that us ing L an g - 8 to study English .
B e c a us e I can get some help from other us er s , while I could help other L an g - 8 us er s to study our C h in e se .
Yes ter day l ate night my hu s b and return ed from B e i j ing .

I called her , but she did n ` t mo ve any m us c le , so I to u ch ed her head but did n ` t open eyes .
This is the the first time she did n ` t open e y e when I to u ch her .
She did n ` t open eyes ?
It ` s the first time while live with her 1 0 year s and 7 m on th es .
A fter me t my hu s b and , we stop p ed by at a an im al ho s p it al .

Let ' s put to g e ther to pro te c t the G l o b al en v ir on ment .
A fter that we went to my a p ar t ment house near b y the re st a ur ant to have dr in k ing part y around 1 1 : 0 0 p m .

D o you have any re c o m m en d ation for sight se e ing of T or on t o ?

It is good to think , study , walk and read ing by myself but that kind of stuff make s me much more alone .
I want a so l u tion about this pro ble m .
I called language school to change me m b er of class .
She of ten i g no re s teacher ' s direction , is n ' t stop talk ing about her s el f , and c a n ' t understand gra m m er . . .

P e op le who leave their home town and come c it ies have their own reason .
The strong est one is that there are many ch ance s to get job s and to make money there .
No w half of the p op ul ation of the world conc ent r ate on ur b an are as .
It is expect ed that two th ir d s of the people in the world will come to live in c it ies by 2 0 5 0 .
As the p op ul ation de n s ity in c re as es , va ri ous pro ble m s a ri se : a ir po ll u tion , water po ll u tion , lack of water , was te dis p or s al , and en er g y con s um p tion .
C on s id er ing the present sit u ation that the c it ies are ex p and ing all over the world , it is in d is p en s able for us to make the ex ce ll ent c ity p l an n ing s to so l ve the pro ble m s a b o ve .

My so n like d there very much ,
He enjoy i ed long s l id e .
He re t ri ed many time s and he was so tired .
He sat is f i ed and he s l ept in the c ar .
As an English le ar n er I have to de c id e what a c c ent I should get .
In K or e a M o st of the ma ter i al s we can get are all A m er ic an style .
It see m s that many K or e an s consider A m er ic an English as the stand ar d of English .
D ur ing W or l d W ar I I , C o l on a i z ation s of U .
made English sp re ad ed all over the world .
But as I have been ex po s ur ed to a l ot of kind s of English on the ne t ,
a c ur i o s ity came up to me .
H aving A m er ic an a c c ent or B ri t ish a c c ent is re ally im p or t ant ?
How about In d i an people ?
Even th ough they have In d i an a c c ent they see m to be o k a y to work and live in A m er ic a or other English speak ing co un t ri es as a me m b er of so c it ies .
I want you guy s ' straight answer es .
I enjoy ed p r a c t ic e to play m us ic with fellows .
The so ng is a f a m ous one in J a p an that ar r an g ed by me .
It is ra in ing out d o or now .
It was a long time since the last ra in .
This ra in and he at in the se days will en h ance the gr ow th of p l ant s .
F or ex amp le , the law n gra s s in our ga r d en is now turn ing gr e en .
However I had been writing my j o ur n al s on `` mi x i `` , the big g est S N S in J a p an an , it act u ally was n ' t a b l o g but only a di ar y that could be read only by my friend s and such .
It s ud d en ly came to me in the begin n ing of this month that I should an no un ce my ex c it ing ex pe ri ence , on my English study , to far more people than I could do on mi x i .
I act u ally started English study last J an u ar y , and I ' ve been study ing English b as ing on `` N at ive M e th o d `` since the la ter half of last F e b r u ar y .
The me th o d f o c us es on the pro n un c i ation and tea ch es us that it de f in ite ly require s us ing our th ro at , from the to p to the bo t t o m , to speak like n at ive English speak er s .
T h r ough the study ing on the me th o d , I ' ve act u ally got not only some ability of pro n un c i ation but also some listen ing ability because of p r a c ri ce to us e my th ro at !
And I ' ve also ga in ed the en er g y to make a l ot of over se as friend s .
E s pe c i ally the se four month s , I ' ve been try ing to make friend s with many for e i g n people on the L an g - 8 and some other sit es .
M or e o ver I some time s re c or d our con ver s ation s having some c as u al in ter v i e w s with such friend s v i a S k y pe .
A n y way I ' m enjoy ing my study on the me th o d so much that I name d my b l o g `` My T h ro at J o ur ne y `` , comp ar ing my interest ing ex pe ri ence of study ing English to a j o ur ne y .
I did n t know this stuff before , and when I told my friend from the U S , he told this stuff , this is co o l stuff ! could I p u b l ish any thing in here , and the people will f i x my sen t ence ? co o l ! ! !
I always have a head a ch e !
But I have that every day .
Some time s the pai n is less some time s is great er .
But un f or t un ate ly I ' m a c c ust ome d with that .
I should see a do c t or .
A c t u ally I have a back a ch e and de s p ite the fact that I am walk ing on morning s ,
it don t stop to hu r t .
I think I need work o ut , it ' s good to body .
No t to be a m us c ul ar man , but just a he al th man .
So you ng and so f il led with pai n .
D o you in ter ent ed in new s ?
I don t think you ng people in J a p an , ar ent interest ed in new s .
I like watch ing new s on T V , and I think it s re ally im p or t ant to get the l ate st new s .
It s very difficult to understand all im f or m ation , for ex amp le po l it ical , e c on o m y , so c i al pro ble m .
the other day , I talk ed with some friend s and I was so surprise d !
because some friend s don t know even the p ri m e mi s is ter in my country .
I was re ally s ur p ri ed and got sh ock .
I can understand if they don t know about difficult new s but it was just p ri m e mi n is ter ' s name .
In j a p an , the p ri m e mi n is ter change s in short ter m .
I think this is not good , and im so con f us ed .
to understand the new s is difficult and many people might think b or ing , but I ho pe more you ng people will turn their eyes to the new s .
A I m p or t ant less on
I re ally surprise d when I watch ed an al ar m c l or k .
was very bu s y .
was tired .
But got p r a c t ic e of l ut e , for it will be the conc er t in A p ri l .
I will go to my be d for having good dr e a m .
It was a J a p an e se style ce le m on y , and which serve d
And my friend and his w if e we ar ed beautiful k im on o .
any suggest ion a mo v i e for im p ro v ing my English ?
I ' d be very ha p p y if you guy s tell me a mo v i e for im p ro v ing my English ! !
S im il ar ly , I ' d like to know mo v ies I should watch .
I watch ed ' In ce p tion ' with English yesterday , it was so hard to understand what they say ex c ept what K en W at an a b e said . .
So I could n ' t have s l ept yesterday .
I ' ve been here in my la b or at or y since yesterday night .
I at e a c up noodle for this b re a k f a st .
C he er me ! ! !
I know it is wrong time of the year for talk ing about C h ri st m as .
We eat f a b c y dinner ( act u ally I eat K F C ) and c a ke and dr in k sp ar k ling w in e at that time .
We sp en d time with our family or co up le .
A t night while ch il d re n are as le e p , S ant a C la us es come to their house and put present into a s ock next to the p i ll ow .
When I were in N e w Z e al and , there were many present s under the tree and ch il d re n open ed them at C h ri st m as .
That mean s they do n ' t p re p ar e s ock next to the p i ll ow ?
It ' s thought that S ant a C la us es put the present under the tree ?
I am look ing for w ar d to he ar that ! !
R e ad ing is f un !
A c t u ally , I work in a b ook s h op .
So , I can bu y b ook s c he a p .
To day is my b ir th day , but just like every year , nothing sp e c i al , nothing im p or ant happen ed the who le day .
I think may b e because people are bu s y with enjoy ing their s um m er ho l i day s and against the ex t re m ly high te m p er a ture .
F or many year s , I have got us ed to it .
I have a brother who was b or n ed in D e c . 1 , the n ation al day .
every on e know s his b ir th day and he always receiv es a l ot of present s .
To day I have receiv ed a l ot of b less ing on my s k y pe , many people said `` ha p p y b ir th day `` to me and asked `` how is your b ir th day `` .
I have to say , not ing sp e c i al , just as usual .
When I was h ed , the was h ing machi ne display ed an er r or co d e and stop .
The man u al said I should turn ed off and on .
Then an er r or co d e went off and I re st ar t to was h .
I told to some of my friend s that very c ut e or beautiful w ome n always have a n ic e person al ity .
They to t ally agree d to my opinion .
A ll the people take care of them , so they are always ha p p y .
There f or e , they only know a good side of the world .
I b ough t bath s c al e
I b ough t bath s c al e and we i g h ed myself yesterday .
S ad ly , I put on some we i g h t .
I should be watch ing my c al or ies first , and I need to do ex er c is e .
That ' s sea s on of we ar ing light c l o th ing .
I was s ad like for me .
I want to become her p ow er .
I work at a board of education in Z ent s u j i c ity .
It ' s for c a n ' t go school st ud ent .
I always feel de f f ic ul t talk ing about my work ,
and what should I us e w or d about my students .
I start la ng 8 ! !
No w I am watch ing `` P ri s on B re a k sea s on 1 `` .
I do n ' t look for the reason I c a n ' t do that .
I de c id e which I do n ' t look for the reason I c a n ' t do that .
There are so many reason s what ever that I c a n ' t do that .
F ir st , I would like to look for the reason I can do that .
`` I have ever eat en s c or p ion before ``
I ' m wonder ing that ' ever ' and ' before ' can be us ed at the same time .
I want ed to bu y a pai r of s ne a k er s which are now in fashion because we ar ing them is all e g ed ly to help you to keep in sha pe .
I had a s light f ever .
On M on day I b ough t an ex p en s ive bo x of ti s s u es .
( 1 0 0 yen is near ly e qu i v al ent to 1 . 2 do ll ar s . ) .
The bo x of ti s s u es I b ough t co st s 2 6 0 yen !
I us ed up the ex p en s ive bo x of ti s s u es for two days .
I ble w my no se so of ten .
I became charge of a certain pro j e c t to day .
This pro j e c t was took over to my tea m from other tea m .
B e c a us e his tea m is too bu s y to de al with this pro j e c t
So I am an x i ous whether we can a ch i e ve success .
about c he at ing bo y friend . . .
and we talk a l ot about l o ve re l ation s h i p s .
every time when we are talk ing about c he at ing , all the guy friend say s
`` all the me n want s to c he at , n ic e guy s just try not to do it .
normal guy just do it ``
because if I l o ve some on e , I do n ' t feel like c he at on him at all .
and all my ex bo y friend said `` I do n ' t like c he at ing !
other w is e , I do n ' t w an n a get mar ry with any on e .
Yes ter day I had something to be s up ri s ed at me .
They said So u th and No r th K or e a are the same country in the K or e an ma p . .
So there are no b or d er and only one c a p it al .
I was big surprise d at it .
So still now , I think some K or e an people ho pe to un ite the two co un t ri es .
( A ) J a p an e se people must be think ing that it is difficult for those who from other co un t ri es to le ar n the J a p an e se language .
( B ) J a p an e se people must think that it is difficult for those who from other co un t ri es to le ar n the J a p an e se language .
It was very interest ing place that has c le an a ir and ri ver .
We enjoy dr in k ing and j a p an e se c ar d game called ha n a f ud a mean s f l ow er c ar d .
My favor ite country is I N D I A .
I read a b ook name d ' a j o ur ne y to s k y - la ke ' ( ? ) by k or e an write r .
A my s ter y of k im on o
I us ed a w or d `` my s ter y `` in the ti t le , but it ' s ex age r at ed .
It ' s just a question about k im on o .
I had k im on o put on s ever al time s as a kid and now I put it on for my job every day as well as every on e else work ing to g e ther .
So I thought I was so f a m il i ar with k im on o that I w o n ' t have any more question about it unti l a f e w days a g o .
However , I was asked an interest ing question at work the other day , so I ' ll write about it here to day .
Then a guy stop p ed me and asked me a question : `` Why do you guy s have that round - sha pe thing behind your s el ve s ? ``
That day I had made my O b i p i ll ow - like sha pe if it was see n from my back straight , and it looked like a round sha pe if it ' s see n from my side .
On the con t r ar ies , I was just con v in c ed like no wonder he had a question like that .
There f or e , feel ing mi s er able , I re p l i ed `` S or ry , I just do n ' t know the reason .
I ' ll c he c k it out la ter , but we us e this sha pe O b i to put me m o p ad s and to w el s inside . `` This is a b it off - the - mar k re p ly !
I know I in t ro d u c ed how to us e O b i f un ction ally in or d er to co ver my mi se ry at the end of re p ly ing . ( I s this ma k ing sen se ? )
It was after a while when I dis c o ver ed a re p ly for his question .
S in ce I felt too mi s er able , I kept think ing about the answer , and f in ally I got to a simple answer : O b i is for hi d ing str ing s under the O b i and if you ti e both end s of O b i on your front , it ' ll get in your way .
Besides , if you leave O b i just ti ed , it ' ll be l o o se because the c l o th of O b i is b ro ad and th ic k , so it need s to be de l t with so that it ' ll be kept for a long time .
There should be some p at ter n s of finish ing O b i , but I think the e as ies t one is us ed now a day s .
The b a b y b ir d s have gr ow n to be you ng er one s in the past four month s .
The last one is just f l o at ing with it s ne c k on the back .
Yes ter day I went to the p on d in the even ing .
But the strong hot s um m er s un was sh in n ing in the s k y .
As soon as I ar ri v ed there , I started con f ir m ing whether they were living s a f e and sound or not , d u e to their in a b il it ies to f ly with their own w ing s as they like .
It was possible that they might be at ta c k ed by big g er b ir d s or s n a ke s as they were play ing without care .
This is probab ly the time when the reason able side of my bra in expect s to he ar something like ( I will never dr in k again bu h u u ) , but I l o ve v o d k a and I know that I ' ll find myself in ex a c t ly the same sit u ation a co up le of days / week s from now .
To day , the so c c er game ( J a p an v s J or d an , As i an C up ) was he l d .
J a p an made many ch ance to go al s , but could n ' t w in .
He is very good play er , so he j o in ed D or tm un d , G er man y tea m , last year .
However , his perform ance was not good to day ' s game .
I expect him to get go al next game !
Some of them are bu s y and some prefer stay ing at home at their free time .
In addition , some of them are sh y .
It would ' t be ex a g g er ate to say that this become s a v it al reason why they are s ing le since they have b or n .
As we get old er and old er , I think that it is ur g ent to find B F by at ten d ing such kind of act i v it ies .
One bo y is my class m ate of the un ive r s ity .
A no ther bo y is hand s ome and s an g quite well .
The un i qu e short c o m ing of this bo y is his he i g h t , honest ly , not too ta ll .
So on , I re al i z e one r ul e from M an k i w ' s ten p r in c i p le s of e c on o m ic s which I re v i e w ed this after no on , that is people face tra d e - off s .
I also want to have a friend who se n at ive is speak ing - e ng l ish .
U n f or t un ate ly , I can feel coming of sp r ing with ha y
I want to go to the country where is no ha y f ever !
How to sp en d on my week en d .
I did n ' t go out ex ept for when I went f o o d sh op p ing .
I w o ke up a little la ter than week day s .
I c le an ed my room because it was me s s .
I did ir on ing some c l o th es .
I c ook ed a J a p an e se style ha m b ur g s te a k which con tain s k at s u o b us h i ( small piece s of s l ic ed dr i ed bo n it o ) and da i k on gra ter .
U s u ally when you eat hu m b ur g s te a k , you may us e de m i - g la ce and so on .
But in this case , I us e so y s a us e .
I st ud i ed a l ot of things .
But , I think that it is ne ce es s ar y to re la x o c c as ion ally .
play ing g u it ar
the se days I ' ve us ed to p r a c t ic e play ing g u it ar on one hour in a day .
high co d e is so hard to me but my g u it ar play ing s k i ll get better in c re as ing ly .
al th ough I play only one so ng that is very easy .
I ' m ha p p y when I play a g u it ar .
I ho pe play ing g u it ar with so ng that is so m b o l of k or e an ' s de m o c r at i z ation mo ve ment es pe c i ally ' morning de w ' , ' ever g re en '

I re m e m b er r h o - m u - h y un ' s play ing g u it ar and I had impress ed his free and easy
may be I gue s s that why am I start le an ing g u it ar .
it ' s reason why I p r a c t ic e play ing g u it ar .
Even though a lack of sleep , I did n ' t feel sleep y at work , but I ' ve been sleep y since I ar ri v ed home .
P er ha p s I would have good to p ic to po st tomorrow .
They are s c at ter ed in C A .
There are a l ot s M and ar in sh op s en c o m p as s the p la z a .
They se ll c he a p er f o o d s than other A m er ic an s up er m ar ke t s or gr o c er ies even who le s al es .
This is my second there since I want ed to be more as s im il at ed with A m er ic an s .
She work ed part time to be a f o o d pro m o ter .
She had a stand to provide c l i ent s try o ut for free .
L i ke s up er m ar ke t in T a i w an , there are always c r ow ed , hu st le and bu st le .
I ho pe this week en d s un n y come s up .
S or ry , I for g ot to w ite the re s ul t of the game that is very im p or t ant for us .
I was b ro k en my hu r t by st or on g tea m which is the ch amp ion tea m in my town .
I did do my be st for tea m .
but I could n t stand the dis c o m f or t of my le g s .
my le g had b ro k en before the game started .
I had thought about that for two week s which I should ch o ic e for me and tea m .
f in ar ry , I de c id ed to keep going to do b a se b a ll .
my tea m ma te told me that you are a b n or m al and you sh o ul see a do c t or .
un f or t un e t ur y , I los t the game that is respon s i ble for me .
I m very s ad
We made our mo d el de b ut ! ?
My so n and I visit ed my hu s b and ' s work p la ce yesterday to take our picture s .
The other day , my hu s b and asked me to take my and our so n ' s picture s for the home p age of his comp an y .
( In c id ent ally , my hu s b and works at an in ter n ation al hotel . ) E s pe c i ally , the p l an is for family , a ccord ing to him .
I did n ' t know why they and my hu s b and asked us to take our picture s , but I was rather interest ed in the request because I us ed to work there when I was a s ing le .
A fter all , I want ed to re m in is ce about those days .
When we ar ri v ed the place , which was a re st a ur ant , I was a little b it surprise d because all the s ta f f s were new to me and the c a f e in ter i or was a little change d .
I felt a l ot of time pass ed . . .
While the p h ot o g r a p h er tak ing our picture s , my so n was n er v ous all the time .
But the p re s s office r s , who were in their 2 0 ' s , un w in d his ten se ness .
A fter that , I felt re la x ed over co f f e e and my so n at e a piece of c a ke with re l ish .
No w a day s there are a l ot of kind s of mo v ies , for ex amp le , come d y , a ction and other s .
E ver y on e has sp e c i al and different s c ri p t and ex c it ing story .
I ' m not ex ce p tion and have f a v o ur ite f il m .
I have see n a mo v i e not long a g o , which as t on ish ed me .
It is called `` T w i light `` .
I have heard a l ot of about this mo v i e , but I had never see n it before this time .
It like s me because the story in this f il m is very ro man t ic .
This mo v i e tell s about re al l o ve , which as p i re all girl s .
And when 2 part this f il m appear in my country , I ' ll de f in ite ly go to the p re m i er e because know , that this part of f il m will not dis a p po in t me .
I of ten read them , but because J a p an e se like to c or re c t , almost all j o ur n al s have been already c or r re c ted !
R e c ent ly , I ( act u ally my mother ) found a new stuff which is as us e ful as an um b re ll a in a ra in y day .
I ' ve heard that S U G I is j a p an e se tree from some on e .
So , I j o in ted one of them .
The le c ture has 4 s er ies , and yesterday was the first day .
A n A m er ic an e m p l o y e e explain ed about their c ul ture only in English for one and a half hour s with his original s l id e show .
A ll a ud i ence s were J a p an e se .
A l th ough it was my first time to j o in the le c ture , it was very f un !
I could understand what he said more than 9 0 % .
H is spoke n English was very understand able for me .
S in ce the le c ture was very f r an k , while we were listen ing to the J e f f ' s le c ture , I some time s could as k some question s in English .
S in ce my T e x an friend is very good at speak ing about A m er ic an history , po l it ic s and re l i g ion s , I ' ve already heard about them from him .
So , my question s were always good question s , and J e f f seemed like str u g g le to find good answer s .
I thought it is still difficult for J a p an e se English le ar n er s to hand le English to co m m un ic ate with for e i g n er s .
S in ce one of 5 could speak English , but his spoke n English sound ed with a very strong J a p an e se a c c ent .
In addition to that , since he us ed so many big w or d s in his con ver s ation s , I could n ' t understand what he want ed to say most of all .
I re ally think it is kind of our pro ble m .
A l th ough to ex p and v o c a b ul ar y is one of im p or t ant things for language le ar n er s , it is more im p or t ant to speak understand able for every body .
P re se re v ed f l ow er less on
I went to le ar n a p re s er v ed f l ow er less on in F ri day .
It was so tired thing for me .
It took about 3 h o ur s .
A c t u ally this class was second time for me .
This class ' s them e was ' V al ent in e ' s day ' .
And sub co l o ur was I could se le c ted any co l o ur f l ow er s .
I se le c ted a i v or y co l o ur ro se .
It ' s very ch ic co l o ur ! !
This p re s er v ed f l ow er will not be g if t for some on e .
One ra b it we ar ing gr e en c l o th ing is a easy guy .
They do n ' t speak at all but we can understand what they do !
I ' m going to write just a little b it because it ' s l ate ( for a school week day ) , and I ' ve a ma th t est to re v is e for tomorrow .
I accept any on e , but I think it would be n ic e if we c or re c t each other .
so if you are an English speak er who le ar n s F re n ch , you can a d d me , and I ' ll try to c or re c t your ent ri es as possible .
But per ha p s the people who will read this ent ry do n ' t want to a d d me no r to c or re c t me . . .
I saw a S K Y L I N E
I saw a mo v i e y est e t day , because I felt like to see a mo v i e .
My room m ate re c ome n d ed s k y line .
I expect ed and I was read y to see a mo v i e .
It did ' t go a head a hour la ter .
It was very short time and very dis a p po in t ment .
M a y b e s k y line 2 will come .
I never see that .
When I bu y something to eat in a s up er st or e , usual ly it has d ate for us e - by .
But in some other co un t ri es , this d ate see m s to mean S ept e m b er 1 0 th 2 0 1 1 .
How do you think about this , or are there any way to dis ting u ish when 0 9 . 1 0 . 1 1 is ?
I ' d like to in t ro d u ce j a p an e se c ul ture and how j a p an e se people think about to p ic s with which people in your country are conc er n .
It would help you know J a p an .
H a p p y new year .
H a ve a good D a y for every on e !
I l o ve mo n day s the be st !
I am bu s y at week en d s on business and the ch il d re n are ha ng ing around .
But to day , on mo n day they are back to school and I am here to write this just wait ing for te le p h on e call s .
V er y quiet and pe a ce ful after no on .
And some time s I am speak ed i ll of one of my co - work er s in front of me .
He p is s ed me off .
But I like another guy s .
B y the way this year I am going to be an a d ul t !
My c ur r ent o c c up ation is an e le ment ar y school teacher .
Some people say , `` T e a ch er s are l u c k y to have such a long va c ation . `` D o you think it ' s tru e ?
It ten d s to be got ten wrong for teachers in J a p an to take long va c ation s because J a p an e se school is suppose d to have three long va c ation s : a s um m er va c ation , a w in ter va c ation , and a sp r ing va c ation .
However , it ' s certain ly tru e that we can take pai d va c ation s more easily this time of the year , where as we have difficult y tak ing days off normal ly .
M o st teachers have even l ot s of work to have nothing to do with students and some h ow str ive to make time to get everything done .
That ' s why I think the se va c ation s are im p or t ant and ne ce s s ar y for teachers to do the se things and have a re st to re fresh our s el ve s .
R e c ent ly , I of ten listen to bo s s an o v a .
There are a l ot of different ch or d .
but I c a n ' t f i g ur e out what is the di f f er ence s .
P la y ing bo s s an o v a m us ic in my room ,
the at m o s p he re is dr a m at ic ally change d ! !
L i ke w is e c as u al b ar ' s at m o s p he re .
S t ud y ing and work ing is go well .
The a p p l ic ation which surprise d me the most was G o o g le sea r ch ing s y s te m .
It even can re c o g n i z e the w or d s `` M a x w e ll B o l t z man dis t ri b u tion `` , which is a j ar g on in the f i el d of c he m is t ry .
( O f course , it s month ly co st is a little b it high er than other s , but it re ally de s er ve s it . )
O ur comp an y is C o f f e e be an s ro s ter .
I ' m s up er v is or of the s al es de p ar t ment .
I like B a se b a ll , My favor ite is S e at t le mar in er s .
I us e s k y pe English con ver s ation and T O E I C ma ter i al .
I had a p r a c t ic e for v o c al en se m ble comp e t i tion to day .
I p r a c t ic ed it four hour s .
There is a la un d ry a d d dr ive through near my house .
It ' s a name of the s c re en s a ver and b l o g access or ies , de ve l op ed by U N I Q L O , f a m ous and one of the big g est bra n d of c l o th ing in J a p an . U N I Q L O C k a im s to sp re ad the bra n d name of the comp an y around the world .
U N I Q L O is a bra n d name , and it s re al c or p or ation name is The F A S T R E T A I L I N G , est a b l ish ed in U b e s ity , Ya m a g u ch i p re f e c ture , we s ter n are a of J a p an .
And the U N I Q L O C K w on the G r and P ri x p ri z es in the C an n ne s C y b er L ion s .
U N I Q L O C K was p u b l ish ed about a year before , and among g e e k s and people who are fashion conc i ous , it is know n as very fashion able and te ch in ical s c re en s a ver .
I have us ed this s c re en s a ver about a half year .
And this B G M is comp o s ed by F ant a st ic P la st ic M a ch in e .
He is one of my favor ite D J , and that is another reason that I like this s c re en s a ver .
If you are interest ed in this pro d u c t s , please down l o ad and us e them .
I gue s s you will be s up ri s ed by m us ic and da n c ing .
If you want to know more about U N I Q L O C K in can ne s C y b er L ion s , please see be l ow ;
Even though some on e said to me `` I will call you la ter . `` , they never call me .
it make s me so s ad and it ro b s me my mo t i v ation ! !
M or e o ver , time go es by it ' s get ting difficult to find an ar t ic le about hi r ing on the we b s ite .
If I c a n ' t find a job , I have nothing to do every day .
I want to do something like volunteer or free English co m m un ity , but to co ll e c t some i nformation is also difficult for me as well .
T w o days a g o , I cha ll e ng ed to get ting the L an g - 8 ra n k ing , `` M o st C or re ction P o in t s `` in a day , and I got 3 0 c or re ction s .
The reason why I ga ve up at 3 0 point s , because in one before the day ( 3 days a g o ) , the one who got `` M o st C or re ction P o in t s `` in a day had 2 1 point .
T h us , I thought `` 3 0 point s are well enough ! `` .
In next day , I c he c k ed the ra n k ing and re al i z e my ra n k ing is 2 n d .
F ur ther m or e , the person who got `` M o st C or re ction P o in t s `` in a day had 3 1 point !
On ly one point ? ? ?
so , `` W ri te your ent ry , please `` .
We have a meeting at 9 : 0 0 and we talk about what we should do to day .
We have a tea b re a k before l un ch time and it ' s about 1 1 : 0 0 .
It is about 1 7 : 0 0 after put ting away the too l s and tak ing a show er .
So we have enough time to enjoy do ing what we want to do such as c he c k ing in ter ne t , watch ing T V , read ing , sleep ing unti l dinner time !
F o ll ow ing j o ur n al is my e - ma il to my friend live in F l or id a .

However , even if I have p r a c t ic ed English pro n un c i ation every day , I re al i z ed that I have n ' t become us ed to ble n d each w or d s in sen t ence s .
There f or e , my co ll o qu i al English sound s very strong J a p an e se a c c ent ed English .
There f or e , I also f o c us on sha d ow ing hard er .

The mar ke ting job as me n tion ed was off er ed by a U A E comp an y .

We can cha t with the S k y pe .
If you live in B e i j ing c ity of C h in a , we can have a cha t in a c a f e .
When I try to say about something . . . .
Some time s it is not because I try to say in English .
I ' m a J a p an e se , but I ' m not good at in t ro d u c ing myself in J a p an e se .

Yes ter d y I dr an k with my old friend at K o b e .
But he had the over w or k yesterday so that I had to wait for him .
A he t r that I could me e t him at around 7 : 0 0 p m .
It was the first time in al o st 2 y e ar s .
I was very ex cited and talk ed with him over dr in k ing much be er !
I was comp le te ly dr un k and act u ally I do n ' t re m en b er what I did talk and how I went home .
I have a l ot of this bad sit u ation s .
E ver y time I dr in k be er or some al ch o l , I always feel like going to Ka ro ke !
No I mean I could n ' t I could n ' t go there .
I should be care ful for not dr i k ing too much be er . . .
If some on e become s my friend , I am glad .
F or p r a c t ic e , I want ed to write f e w sen t ence s .
So I try to make the story now .
I went out for bu y some s n a c k s in the mi d night .
I turn ed the corner .
There was E la in there .
`` He y , what do you do here ? ``
E la in looked like s up ri s ed .
I am hu r ry .
H aving no time for explain . ``
M ar l ow e , you must be on the way of bu y ing many of j un k f o o d s . ``
And made hard face , p re ten d ing a ng ri ly .
`` I said you should keep your me al small er , M ar l ow e ! ``
But at the mi d night street , I could not take long time for con v ar s ation .
The se days , de ng er ous l ud s was s ne e k ing around every where .
And at this time , a guy who took on strange co l or ed c l o th came close us .
And look over there , some on e look s strange come .
`` D on ' t to u ch me with this way ! ``
I hi d E la in back of the she l ve s , and took out a co s h from inside my j a c ke t .
`` L ook , the guy ' s face ! ``
W i ll you help me im p ro v ing this ?
I found your pro g r a m in i T un e st or e last year .
E ver y time I he ar you talk ing about the im p or t ance of good f o o d es pe c i ally for ch il d re n , I re m e m b er my j un i or high school teacher and what he said to our p ar ent s .
K id s need ed to b r ing b ent o ( p or t able me al in a con tain er ) themselves for l un ch .
A l ot of people made b ent o home , but there were also read y made b ent o so l d in va ri ous est a b l ish ment s .
I went to a public j un i or high school in a r ough are a of a big c ity , where had many st or es s el ling b ent o .
There were a l ot of con ve n i ence , but at the same time , a l ot of so ur ce s of an x i e ty for p ar ent s with te en age ch il d re n .
A t the or i ent ation for the new students and their p ar ent s , a middle a g ed teacher who has ri ch ex pe ri ence of help ing students with pro ble m s said to the p ar ent s ;
A ccord ing to him , he has never see n a kid who had home m ad e b ent o on a re g ul ar b as is going into the wrong direction .
If kid s get money to bu y b ent o in s te ad , it can le ad them to the wrong direction .
But on sp e c i al o c c as ion s like school ' s sp or t s day and f i el d tri p , kid s need to b r ing their own b ent o .
C on t ent s of b ent o are of ten the left o ver s from a previous day .
As a mother of two bo y s with work , it ! s not an easy ta s k to make b ent o e ar ly in the morning , But re c al ling how my mother who was a way bu s i er than I am , made b ent o for me on every school days , I am try ing my be st to do the same to my ch il d re n .
It was so b or ing in the morning that my family went to the G w an g y an g c ity to bu y some k or e an hot pe p p er past es .
We had b ough t it this A p ri l but it had already been eat en at all .
It was ra in y to day but we felt ex cited think ing to bu y the k or e an hot pe p p er past e .
F in ally we me t the me r ch ant of it and b ough t as many as four t u b s .
I gue s s it will be eat en for about six month s .
I asked a re c o m m en d ed t un e in the di ar y the day before yesterday .
I listen ed to the se t un es from which the se were re c o m m en d ed on You T u b e after work end s .
I will sleep after bath ing .
I ant ic i p ate they are be a ten .
I should think my future !
When I was high school st ud ent , I w or e school un if or m .
But now I am co ll e g e st ud ent .
So , I must think fashion sen se .
It was D o ll ' s F est i v al , which is for girl , yesterday .
P e op le display a set of do ll s and p r a y for gr ow th of girl s in family .
M or e o ver , display ing and put ting away take a l ot of time .
He ll o , some time ' s I as k myself , what can I write here ?
To day I had a he a v y day , and I ' m very tired .
But I be l ive that G o d help s me all time .
I had s te a m ve g e t able s and or g an ic w in e .
I usual ly do n ' t eat much ve g e t able s , but I could eat s te a m one .
T h o se are very he al ty .
I of ten sen d e m a il s to a for e i g n co ll e a gue in the head office in S ing a po re .
To day , I sen t an e m a il to her and give a suggest ion to im p ro ve ri s k as se s s ment act i v ity .
She re p l i ed to me very quick ly as always and a p p re c i at ed me very much .
To my surprise , she us ed e m ot ic on s in the end of her e m a il .
It may be difficult for you to j ud g e by only the i nformation a b o ve , is it a sign that she has tru st in me or feel something f a m il i ar to me as a co ll e a gue ?
If so , I am glad that I have a little close for e i g n co ll e a gue for the first time .
The make - up will be original ly a thing do ing in a place hi d d en from the eyes of person s .
How do you think about this ?
In this after no on , a we a ther new s on a ra d i o said , `` It ' s going to be ra in ing tomorrow after ty p h o on has go ne . `` It ' s turn ed out we can put out our la un d ry tomorrow .
I ' ve just came back home from T a i w an .
T a i w an is for me the be st place to visit .
A n y way day after tomorrow I ' m going to leave for B an g k o k .

S um m er va c ation started !
I at e a sha v ed ic e , a b an an a ch o c o l ate , and a `` k ar a age `` .
I want s um m er va c ation to con t in u e for ever !
The se day s , the b ir th ra te of J a p an is dr op p ing and it is said that it ' ll re a ch to under 1 . 0 in the future .
However , at the same time , J a p an e se e c on o m y is under a s ever e sit u ation .
F ur ther more , the to t al p op ul ation in J a p an , es pe c i ally the work ing p op ul ation ra te is dr op p ing , which f u el s re ce s s ion .
T h us , w ome n play an im p or t ant ro le as a la b or for ce .
U n d er such circumstance s , we can not i g no re the work ing en v ir on ment of mother s now .
A ccord ing to a s ur ve y , more than 7 0 % J a p an e se w ome n ga ve b ir th to a ch il d and end up le aving a job .
To de al with this pro ble m , I ' d like to suggest one so l u tion .
That is that the comp an y has to show more understand ing for the ch il d care and work s up p or ting mother pro g r a m in to p r a c t ic e im m ed i ate ly .
The pro g r a m is like set ting a day n ur se ry room at the office , which en able mother s to take a ch il d to the office .
I w ro te this ent ry p re p ar ing for the w ri t n i g part of the I E L T S .
So , If there ' s any w or d that is not us ed in the B ri t ish English country , let me know please .
I ' ll give it my c l u b me m b er .
B e c a us e I do n ' t have bo y f ri en d , I ' m not going to give to my bo y f ri en d ; ;

As usual , tell me whether it ' s proper or in c or re c t .
I was so ha p p y , I was so tired that I had n ' t any thought s in my mind , it ' s re ally re st ful , I felt as though things could n ' t be better .
No ne th e less , I was very ex ha ust ed , and I was on the ed g e to pass out / I was sub j e c t to pass out .
It seemed I am l un at ic , do n ' t you think ?
Even t u ally , I comp el led myself to wall ow at 1 0 am in my be d for an hour or so .
And other sen t ence s which have nothing to de al with my story , just to f it some v o c a b ul ar y ( of which ? ) I ' m not sure I m aster yet
P ri or to when he mo v ed out to A m er ic a , he was always re ly ing on his pe er s , now he is much more in depend ent .

My job is s ta f f in con ve n i ence st or e .
T h an k you for coming my di ar y .

The tra ve l was very ex c it ing because .

I want to co ll e c t like it from all over the world .
It ' s the one of my dr e a m s .
C an you j o in us ?
I was n ' t write anything for a long time , there was something wrong with me .
Some time s , I said something between me , it was all about my mind ; but not every on e could have the same feel ing at all .
There were so many things happen ed around the world , and every on e ho pe they will be al ri g h t , G o d b less .
My W a c o m G r a p h i re 3 t able t ( comp ut er dr ow ing too l .

I did everything I can but it never work again .
Well , I b ough t it 5 y e ar s a g o . . .

I ' ve got a ma il about something like co s p la y even t from you .
My English less on will start tomorrow at new school
D ur ing when I stay ed in U K last month , I not ic ed that I have to study English more .
There f or e , I de c id ed to change the English school for im p l o ve my English ability .
There are close to my comp an y and also having a good en v i ro ment .
I ` m look ing for w ar d to le ar n ing the English .
The a im of s al es man is that they de l ive r ha p p i ness to c ust ome r s .
They need to think what c ust ome r s re ally want .
They can re al i z e c ust ome r s me t by look ing them care ful ly .
They get more money by g i v ing c re at ive and va l u able idea s to pro d u c t s .
They need to think more de e p ly about something from different point of view other people are un able to see .
The se are one of im p or t ant fact or s for a good s al es man .
A fter I write di ar y , I do tell me more .
B a se b a ll c l u b is off sea s on .
I study e ng l ish hard .
In the end of the last year , my bo y friend ga ve me a present .
It was the b a g which I had want ed , so I became very ha p p y .
When I open ed it , my bo y friend said `` please mar ry me ! ``
O f course , I accept ed it : )
To day is sp or t s day .
I was s c r at ch near my left e y e .
I write a first di ar y .
I in t ro d u ce myself first .
The age 2 3 year s old .
I like an over se as mo v i e very much .
So it ' s because I ' d like to a mo v i e without sub ut it le s .
B e c a us e I did study English .
but English is being st ud i ed str en u ous ly by s el f - education .
I want you to tell me a s la ng .
sp or t s and co g n it ive a b il it ies
A c t u ally she was the one propos ing that we should do that e ar ly in the morning .
M o st of the people who he ar about that agreement think that we ' re c r a z y .
The pe a ce ful and quite time even in the heart of a big g er c ity when every on e is still sleep ing and the b ir d s w a k ing up start ing to s ing their beautiful me l o d y is an en ri ch ment to the qu al ity of my life .
A t first I did n ' t see it that way d u e to the fact that I was dis t r a c ted by keep ing up run n ing but now , after the run n ing became second nature ( ? ) I ' m able to look around .
The reason why I want ed to start this little pro j e c t of mi ne was a short es s a y in one of the b ook s I read .
To s um m ar ies the con t ent I would have to point out the s c i ent if ic as pe c t of im p ro v ing one s co g n it ive a b il it ies by in c re as ing the b l o o d c ir c ul ation and there b y p um p ing more b l o o d to the bra in it s el f .
A l th ough you have to be care ful with this s y m b o l I just c re at ed but it is no ne th e less a very co l or ful way to put it .
I had nothing to do to day ex c ept a f e w home w or k and no a p po in t ment either , so I could feel re fresh ed to day .
I came to set t le down here and got over j e t la g , so I re al i z ed that I got tired since I came to L on d on .
I did n ' t feel tired may because I had kept n er v ous .
My ho st s is ter did n ' t have work to day so that she took me to H um p st ed , where there were sh op s and c a f es and I felt that a so f is t ic at ed are a .
We did girl t al k in a c a f e over a c up p ut in o and small c a ke s , which made me so ha p p y .
I write a di ar y at L an g 8 for the 1 st time .
I finish ed a read ing se ction more than 2 0 minute s left at the t est .
A ty p h o on will get close r to O s a k a my home t ow n to m m or ow morning .
I ' m afraid that a st or m w ar n ing is is s u ed in my home t ow n .
I thought it would be a n ic e idea to write how do I act u ally le ar n English , so you can us e my me th o d , too .
How am I im m er s ed into English ?
U s u ally , for as much time as I can , I am try ing to s ur r ound myself with English .
It can be everything : po d c a st s , something to read ( b ook s , ar t ic le s e t c . ) , mo v ies , even m us ic or something else .
When I do n ' t know some w or d and I ' m not at home , I c he c k it in di ction ar y and put it on t o re g ul ar paper - w or d l is t .
If I ' m le ar n ing at home , I put new w or d s with their translation s direct ly into A n k i ( paper - w or d l is t is n ' t require d then ) .
If le ar n ing give s me no f un and it ' s b or ing , there must be something wrong with it .
J ust as k me them in commen t s .
I have to w a ke up e ar ly tomorrow morning .
M a y b e pro f es s er say im p or t ant thing about ex a m in the class .
P le a se tell me how to go to sleep when you are not sleep y .
T O E F L speak ing se ction has 6 question s .
Q u es tion 1 and 2 are in depend ent speak ing question s .
F or ex amp le one ' s l i k ing or ex pe ri ence s .
The ex a m in e es have to say their opinion s and a d d the conc re te reason s for them .
We have 1 5 second s p re p ar ation time after the question s are read .
And after that , we have to answer them in 4 5 second s .
H a ll o .
I write in di ar y here for the first time .
I have st ud i ed English for 8 year s and a b o ve .
I ra n 6 0 mi le the long est course .
It includ ed very long hi ll c l im b and down hi ll .
It ' s hard er than I expect ed .
It ' s very fine day , and I could see very n ic e view !
To day again I re c or d ed a v id e o .
I can may b e say `` How are you being as a ch i e f in a new di v is ion ? `` , but here it does not make any sen se .
- > L o g ic has a very strong p ow er that per s u ad es any hu man being s , but after all they c a n ' t live only with that .
The se picture s are n ut s of s il ver v in e .
We us e those for c r ud e dr u g s .
The se works on people who have poor c ir c ul ation .
I p ic k led them in a co l or less l i qu or and made f r u it l i qu e ur .
In a half year or a year this l i qu e ur will be read y to dr in k .
It ' s not quite ta s ty , good for your he al th .
The we a ther is even bad .
No w a day , I do n ' t know what I am .
It is too tired to me
H is f ri st impress ion was not bad .
When I can me e t a my re al bo y friend ?
V o y a ir a ho n d ur as en s ept i e m b re o o c t u b re .
I can re c or d what I speak in English , up l o ad on You T u b e and l in k it here .
I did n ' t want to say a p es s im is t ic thing because I believe the p ow er of w or d s , but I can not help saying that .
I know the re s ul t that I could n ' t get even a job in ter v i e w cause d by my poor care er for the position .
I know it ' s not good idea to a p p ly for a job that does n ' t f it my care er .
I still do n ' t want to work for the money , but how can I be so n a ive ?
I want ed to as k some on e to help me , but my be st friend transfer r ed to O s a k a and other friend s work as usual , so I could n ' t depend on .
In addition , my P C s ud d en ly be e p ed at the time of bo ot - up and could n ' t run .
If I could say something through the In ter ne t , I might feel not so l on e ly .
F or now , it keep s run n ing .
I ' m so re l i e v ed because I can not a f f or d to bu y new P C now .
My favor ite f i g ur e s k at er M a o As ad a mi s s ed all j um p s at both her S P and L P .
We , all of her f an s know she is try ing to f i x all her j um p s this sea s on because she a im s to get the go l d me d al at next w in ter O ly m p ic s , So ch i .
So her j um p s can not be st able for the moment .
M a o go es through the hard est sea s on .
I have take n my school ' s ex a m since yesterday .
I am try ing them to day .
To day ' s ex a m is English ! !
I l o v r ock ' n ro ll : )
but I l o v bo s s a no v a too : D
so I p r a c t ic ing a so ng `` ga ro ta de i p an e m a `` now !
To day , I and my p ar ent s went to M at s us h im a which is the most f a m ous s c en ic sp ot s in J a p an .
I went to b ook st or e .
So I went to b ook st or e .
I ch o o se `` s no op `` .
`` s no op `` is b ook name .
I want that this b ook is interest ing .
I like m us ic , but I have c a n ' t s ing on ke y .
M a y b e it ' s cause for why my e ng l ish is poor .
( * _ * I s is a beautiful ex c us e ? )
I of ten her ad that many girl s have no sen se of direction .
But it ' s un l u c k y no body say that many girl s have no sen se of m us ic .
O ther w is e I will have a beautiful ex c us e about language .
P er ha p s a sen se of good m us ic indeed it e as i er for for e i g n language , but I do n ' t think the qu al ity of for e i g n language is l in k ed to m us ic sen se what is good or bad .
O ther w is e , the m us ic i an s are language s ch o l ar s .
D o c , and D o c show s that he in v ent ed a time machi ne .
The en er g y of the time machi ne is p l ut on i um and he c a j o led it out of a ter ro ri st gr o up .
There f or e , he was re ve ng ed and k il led by them .
It happen s that M ar ty is there , so they also tri es to k i ll him .
He tri es to es c a pe get ting in the time machi ne and he tra ve l s time to the past in 1 8 5 5 by ch ance .
But , In the per i o d , it is almost im po s s i ble to get p l ut on i um , so he can not go back to his per i o d and he tri es to go back some h ow .
F o x who play ed M ar ty is so co o l and I like M ar ty ' s father much .
I watch it more than 1 0 time s .
I ho pe that I can me e t a mo v i e that is great er than `` B a c k to the future `` some day : )
This is my first time to try writing di ar y in English !
2 w e e k s have p s s ed since I came to L on d on .
I ' m a c c ust ome d new life here a little .
No w I live in an in ter n ation al dormitory , but I can not make any in ter n ation al friend s here because my room m ate is l s o J a p an e se . . .
How can I make my life full . . . ? ! ! !
In those days , there was no good English - J a p an e se di ction ar y in J a p an .
W h i ch do you feel better and c or re c t , or what di f f er ence do you tell between the two ?
It was the world di a b e te s day .
When I was ar ri v ing at the K y ot o st ation , I found a b l u e to w er .
It is usual ly w h ite , because it was made through J a p an e se can d le im age .
On that day a l ot of bu il d ing s in the world were b l u e !
I like J o h n , and he ' s my be st friend .
We had been talk ing almost every day for more than one and a half year s .
We have s im il er p es pe c t ive about many things , and I found that he ' s so funny and s m ar t .
B e c a us e both of us were bu s y last week , we ' ve not talk ed for a week .
I saw my bo y f ri en d in the week .
O f c or se I l o ve my bo y f ri en d , but I mi s s ed J o h n some time s .
J ust before we talk ed , he put his ma s s age for me in the cha t bo x , and it said `` I mi s s ed you . `` I was ha p p y about that he had th o g h t in s im il er way I had .
That was only a week , but I felt like that was so H is ash i b ur i .
I re ally ho pe he would find the one for him very soon .
My idea l ha us e
My hu s b and and I went to part y of my teacher ' s so n .
She b ough e t a new co t t age re s ent ly so she invite d it to gue st s .
It was a so w on d ar ful la ke side co t t age !
L a ke is big and clear , and there is con ve n i en e are a .
It ' s a close to down t ow n so I think this are a people live s co m f or t able .
A l ot of gue st enjoy ed to ri d e a boat on the la ke .
It ' s a us idea l life !
so we find a la ke side re n ted house now .
M a y b e it ' s difficult but I want to find idea l house be c ous e we will not live it
R e c ent ly , I c a n ' t make a time to write a di ar y on L an g - 8 .
I ' m keep ing on study ing English .
Yes ter day , I de c id ed to a p p ly for t est of T O E I C .
The t est is done at j u ly 2 5 .
I think that t est is n ' t c er t if i ed `` speak ing English `` .
But I ho pe the s c or e give me a con f id ence for study ing English .
I have about 2 month by t est of T O E I C .
I ' ll study more a l ot of English !
I study English now .
L a st week I b ough t i po d to u ch .
I listen `` A l ic e in wonder l and `` by this through a p p that is A ud i o b ook .
A ud i o b ook is read ing very f a st .
So it is difficult for me to understand the matter .
R e c ent ly , at work , my tea m is p re p ar ing a n ation w id e even t .
But , as you know , H 1 N 1 is all around every where , and it is get ting w or se and w or se , so we were in c ance ling pro ce s s .
I ' m worry ing that C o ul d this even t end with out any pro ble m ?
B e c a us e I go l i b r ar y to st ud ing e ng l ish at 9 : 0 0 a . m .
but I have not re st .
I have to at ten d an English a c ad e m y on week day s .
To day is ho l i day ~ ~ ^ ^ ! so I ' m ha p p y .
I over s le e p at to day .
A fter , I pass ed the day with my M o m .
My mo m is funny , and she make ha p p y to me .
I was bu y sh o es at H ome p ul s .
A fter , we go sh op p ing c ent er for my s ne a k er s .

my s ne a k er s is co l or p in k .
I like p in k co l or .
So my s ne a k er s very light .
A fter , we go c l im b ing at H a m J i mo un tain .
The c l im b ing was hard me .
To day my feel is good .
M o st im p or t ant ly , I pass ed the day with my M o m .
In K or e a , there are ma m y ho l i day s .
In A p ri l , K or e an p l ant many tree s es pe c i ally on A r b or day to me m or y this day .
This no ve l is a kind of an a ut o b i o g r a p h y of the a u th or , who is in her mi d - th ir t ies , just after a di v or ce ment , and sea r ch ing for a new way of living pe a ce ful ly .
She go es to I ta ly first to ex p l or e pleasure , then go es to In d i a to ex p l or e di v in ity , and f in ally go es to In d on es i a to find a tru e l o ve .
He r tri p was for a year , four month s for each country .
to l o o se my we i g h t
I would like to my we i g h t about 5 k g .
I s w a m 1 k m , so tired .
T ri p To The C o un t ry s id e
I have to study in the co ll e g e and I go back home s ever al time s .
But I s el d o m go back to the v i ll age , which hold my who le ch il d h o o d .
I can still see the gra pe t re l is of the ne i g h b o ur .
But we are now in the different way .
I ' m st ud ing in the co ll e g e .
I ho pe , what ever time change s , it will never change my heart .
E ver y girl s all think that themselves are so f at .
So every girl s always say that I ' m los ing we i g h t re c ent ly .
A c t u ally , my we i g h t had ga in ed twenty p ound s in the last year , I ' m so s ad about this fact .
No w I make a big de c is ion that los ing we i g h t .
I will on a di e t which have n ' t dinner .
And I will take ex er c is e that y o g a and dance three time s a week .
S un m er soon coming , I need los ing we i g h t in a short time .
S un m er , I l o ve it , but I did not l o ve f at ! ! !
My ho b b y is read ing a my s ter y b ook .
I like the b ook of E ll er y Q u e en .
I think he is the No 1 my s ter y a u th or .
Some day I want to be able to read ing English my s ter y .
D o I re ally become able to read ?
U s u ally I think I am ha p p y to b ir th in J a p an .
But when I read a my s ter y b ook I wish I were A m er ic an .
It come s the ra in y sea s on .
In H y o u g o this week has been ra in y , and we a ther for e c a st say s it will have been ra in y unti ll this week en d .
E ver y th ing have hu m id ity and are st ic k y .
But from this sea s on ri ce and other p l ant s gr ow to w ar d to a ut um n ha r ve st time .
F or this gr ow th it is ne ce s s ar y to ra in .
So people who are in J a p an feel un c o m f or t able but wish to ra in .
When this sea s on will pass , it will be s um m er that will be too hot to go to school , and ch il d re n will be in s um m er va c ation .
F in ish ed after , I l ent C D s at the T S U T A Y A .
A n e ar th qu a ke had happen ed just before again .
I had become e ar th qu a ke - sick .
I always feel like to be di z z y x (
I gue s s a big e ar th qu a ke will happen to J a p an near day .
I take a s n a p l o l
It take s 1 0 minute s for me to read one p age .
In addition , how long will it take for me to be able to read those j o ur n al s f a st ?
In my opinion , in or d er to p re v ent from ex a m watch ing , to in c re a ce the number of watch man is im p or t ant .
I had dinner now .
It was de ri c i as !
It is ve s it able in so up .
I like N a g as a k i C h an n p on .
On ce un ive r s ity ex a m in ation is over , you do n ' t have to study English .
M an y students ten d ed to stop study ing English when they got into un ive r s ity .
They did n ' t ne ce s s ar i ly ha te English , but I think there were ma in ly two reason s .
It is first time to write my di ar y on this sit e .
My name is Y u k i and am living in A ust r al i a with A ust r al i an hu s b and and to w kid s .
I am going to have L un ch time P ar ty with my J a p an e se w ive s friend s .
No w , I have to go to w a ke up my kid s and hu s b and to get read y for school and work .
No w , I tri ed We b s er v ic e us ing S k y pe .
F ir st of all , I need to re m o ve f e ar of speak ing in English .
I an no y ed for the guy s at t it ud e .
The guy must be a per ver t , I was sure about it .
This time , E x - p re s id ent ' s mouth was t re m b ling .
He would say something ?
My m us c le s str a in ed a b it for expect .
But also he could just s ing st up id so ng s or ro ar like w il d an im al s .
I did n ' t know what this so r t of person want to do , so I had to keep E la in and the sh op ke e p er away from him .
I watch ed the guy care ful ly , and felt E la in watch ed me from behind my back .
A fter a w h i le E x - p re s id ent open d his mouth .
It was very s l ow .
I could catch the w or d `` G er d n er `` but his voice was quite hard to he ar .
I s `` G er d n er `` a some on e ' s name ?
I felt little con f us ed .
A fter set t ling down in T a i w an for a while , I came to J a p an for job hu n ting and J a p an e se study .
This is my second month in J a p an and almost everything is no the tra c k now .
My 9 0 day l and ing per m it quite an no y s me as not being all ow ed to work here however hard I do job hu n ting .
L u c k i ly I ' d get the one - year st ud ent v is a by the end of this M ar ch per m it ting me to work with in 2 8 h r s per week .
I w an n a start my care er in J a p an so bad ly but what I had le ar n t for my M aster does n t re ally work out here co z comp an ies here see m to sp on s or n at ive teachers only and what I ' ve got so far is just some te m p or ar y teaching job s .
T h ough better than nothing @ @
I ' d like to make more and more friend , so from now on I ' m go n n a write as many di ar ies as possible and make c or re ction s .
A n y way , I have only one more week before I ' m le aving to N e w Z e al and .
As some on e ' s already know n , I ' m going to stay in N Z for a half year .
And I ' m p l an ing to le ar n English , work there , of course have a va c ation .
I ' m not sure what I need there and what I can t get there .
F ri day , I took the t est at school .
This t est was last one for up p er in ter m ed i ate le ve l .
I of ten con f us e between `` The future per f e c t `` , `` The future per f e c t con t in u ous `` and `` The future con t in u ous `` .
I made many ex amp le sen t ence and tri ed to understand .
In the t est , I was wrong one sen t ence , but almost all were c or re c t .
But the first , understand ing is very im p or t ant .
I pass ed the t est with very good s c or e ! ! !
( A c t u ally , the t est would not have so difficult , if I had been in the class every day . )
A fter the t est , we went to the p u b as a ce re b r ate !
He had t aught me when I started the school about 7 month a g o .
In that time , I could n ' t speak English well .
He had t aught me just t w ic e .
We did n ' t speak long time and in No r ve m b er he became a my teacher again .
He said my English was im p ro ve than before .
It ' s difficult to comp ar e my English for myself .
He know me quite long and before and now .
I think we talk ed a l ot but I do n ' t re m e m b er so much .
To m or r ow I ' m going to start a d v ance le ve l class .
I ' m look ing for w ar d it ! ! !
T w o month es has already pass ed since I came here .
I ' ll stay here only 3 m or e month es .
I c a n ' t feel that my English is im p ro v ing yet .
I have to study my s el .
I wish I could speak English more f l u ent ly , we could co m m un ic ate each other ! !
That ' s why I study hard much more ! ! !
The name is `` D es er t R o se `` .
D es er t R o se is a name of the ma ter i al .
( I s this sen t ence heard strange ? )
( D o it he ar like de s er t is ri s ing ? )
( R o se mean s name of the f l ow er . )
That he ar y um m y : - )
Yes ter day , I b ough t a G o d i e g o ' s C D .
Then , I heard it .
P le a se listen this so ng !
To day an idea hi t upon in my mind . `` Why do the people read b ook s ? ``
I have never thought about it , because that question look s p h il o s op h ical .
But to night I try to think !
My op p in ion : The reason people read b ook s
To get know led g e
To consider a b st r a c t things , p h il o s op h ical things or mathematics and so on .
J ust enjoy it s el f like read ing a f ant as y no ve l .
I w an n a know a l ot of thing about the world .
That ' a a serious pro ble m , I think .
The character is t ic of hu man being is that hu man can consider a b st r a c t ly .
M a y b e too many read ing los e ability of think ing , S ch op en ha u er ( the f a m ous p h il o s op h er ) also said that .
A fter all , we have to us e my bra in and think through read ing .
I can read b ook s ra p id ly , but I c a n ' t think de e p ly in the mi d st of read ing .
D o es any body have idea about read ing b ook s ? ?
If you have something , please commen t : )
I ' ve finish ed read ing all J a p an e se b ook s I ' ve got at home the other day .
So I ' ve de c id ed to read English b ook s which is e as i er to get .
It ' s k il ling two b ir d s with one stone ; I can study English and it take s much long er time to read than J a p an e se , which mean s I can s a ve money .
This is my very first time to visit this home p age .
My friend said that there is re ally good home p age to ex er c is ing English and ma k ing friend s .
There is some beautiful c l er k s .
What should I write ? ? ?
My ma j or at my un ive r s ity was English , but I ' d like to ma j or mar ke ting at E ng l and .
I conc er n about my English s k i ll when I go to U K .
I ' m not good at speak ing and W ri ting .
So please c or re c t my J o ur n al and become a good friend with me ! !
This sit e is help ful for me because I do n ' t have op po t un ity to w t ite in English .
My e ng l ish is still poor , but I ' d l o ve to im p ro ve .
I will go to the b ook st or e and b ro se some b ook s .
My town has a big b ook st or e so it ' s con ve n i ent for me .
So the sit u ation will probab ly get w or se tomorrow and new s re p or t s say that the ty p h o on will hi t my are a direct ly and have more ra in f a ll .
The go ver n ment has already de c id ed to dis p at ch some un it s of S el f D e f en se F or ce .
We had a re s er v ation for the hotel , so we c he c k ed in , then went the re st a ur ant name d B u c a M ar i o .
It seemed that they were f a m ous re st a ur ant , about 1 0 people were in the qu e u e .
I thought this ra re in I ta ly to make qu e u e for re st a ur ant .
U n c r ed ably , we had to take about 5 0 0 s ta ir s to go there .
There were no l if t s .
It was w or h t c l im b ing all the way up there , we had beautiful view .
In this con ne ction , F ir en z e is f a m ous for J a p an e se mo v i e `` R e is e i T O J o un e t s u No A id a ``
A fter that , when we were head ed to P on te V e c ch i o , a you ng guy asked me to take a p h ot o for them .
I receiv ed th i er favor with pleasure .
But the came r a does n ' t work even though my 3 time s tri al .
While that , my w if e took a p h ot o of them next to me with s m il ing .
You ng g u ies are always in no c ence .
B o y s be am b t i ous !
We went to P i a z z al e M ic he la ng el o , you can see ent i re c ity from there .
M o st of them were co up le and to ur is t .
When we were in the n ic e mo o d with this beautiful view , we could he ar a m us ic in a p p ro p ri ate to the place .
A street perform er dr e w a picture with the m us ic .
I wish ed he would have draw n at another place .
This T u es day , I had l un ch with my co ll e a gue in a Y un N an ' s re st a ur ant , which ma in ly s al es ri se - noodle .
S ud d en ly , an el d er man appeared in front of us , tak ing a bu c ke t of re d eggs .
He put two eggs on our t able , and said to us that his w if e ga ve b ir th to a b a b y some days before and he would like to treat us the f est i v al eggs .
We con g r at ul at ed him and a p p re c i at ed for his eggs .
In some are as of C h in a , if a family get a girl , the hu s b and treat s his f ri e and s re d eggs and if it is a bo y , the hu s b and treat s his friend s the re d eggs with one black point on each of the eggs .
This kind of eggs name d F est i v al E g g s .
My le c ture r is a str ic t people .
I think it would be a quite hard paper for me to s c or e high mar k s .
W ish me have a good l u c k .
I ' m not re ally know how to p ar a p h r a se an ar t ic le . . .
It ' s quite hard for me because I know less v o c a b ul ar y . . .
A c t u ally , English is not a sub j e c t that can do re v is ion . . .
so that , I do n ' t know what am I s up p or t to do now . . . .
D o you know how pai n ful it is ?
To have your dr e a m r u in ed by 2 c m ?
T h an k you for let ting me sha re about my mi se ry .
I will go to a conc er t of L U N A S E A in C h ri st m as .
They will hold a conc er t which re qu ir us to come we ar ing black c l o th es .
We have to we ar black c l o th es a b s o l ut e ly .
I went to the b ook st or e to bu y his no ve l s .
So I b ough t `` The B la c k D a h l i a `` at A m a z on .
However , my p ar ent s does n ' t play in water p ar k so our family receiv e ed it L u c k i ly .
We of ten go this kind of water p ar k and hot s p r ing s but we enjoy ed at water p ar k two straight days after so long .
I put on s un s c re en but the s un was so strong , I got s un b ur n ed .
I feel pai n of my back and should er s es pe c i ally .
I do n ' t want to c ar ry my kid s on my back and I felt pai n on my should er when I put sea t be l t on a c ar in this morning .
What is the D if f er ence ?
D o you know a we b s ite C or e t o ? ?
It provide s a kind of a u ction p l at f or m like y a h o o a u ction and e B a y , but it is a little different from the other s like those two .
The ma in di f f er ence is that you do n ' t need to sp en d money to get any good s in this sit e , because the ma in idea of the sit e is b as ed on b ar ter ing .
C or e t o can be effect ive for the ga r b age pro ble m s if more people us e the s y s te m .
No more c ry for a ch o c o l ate .
No shout for sea r ch of a w h ite be ad she was play ing with .
We are in a room on the second floor of my w if e ' s p ar ant s ' house .
It is a pe a ce ful , quiet and w ar m even ing of the n ation al ho l i day .
I just want to p r a c t ic e English in a big s il ence , which has s ud d en ly visit ed me since she f e ll as le e p .
Y e a h - ! !
I came home now !
V er y in t re st ed !
I tri ed that .
And , I was dr in k and stand ing a so ng . . . . .
I enjoy ed very m us h !
I ' m so sleep y now !
However I write yesterday ' s di ar y in English .
Yes ter day , I made In st ant R ame n for l un ch .
To p p ing was e g g and sp ro ut .
T as te was M is o .
It ' s my favor ite ta s te .
yesterday ' s R ame n was very de l ic i ous ! !
E s pe c i ally I l o ve R ame n , ic e c re a m , T en p ur a , and so on .
So , I eat ic e c re a m every day .
I l o ve S up er C up made in M e i j i fact or y .
And feel so ha p p y e b er y day than k s for eat ing ic e c re a m .
What f o o d is do you like ?
But then it is di c on ne c ted , and con ne c ted again .
That sit u ation is con t in u ing many time s !
In ter ne t is also dis c on ne c ted some time s .
R e c ent ly , I am so bu s y .
When you are bu s y , how do you keep your mo t i v ation and study ing ?
I need sleep more to keep my he al th , but I also need study English more .
I am p l an n ing to go to English sh o o l to study business English for my job .
I thought I can get good life s ty le in S ing a po re , but in fact I am work ing hard very hard every day .
I did not want to watch such a dis g ust ing mo v ies , but I am very honest and since r ity person , so I o b e id his or d er .
I watch ed that for around 2 hour s .
But tra g ed y s ud d en ly str u c k me .
dis g ust ing se x p op s ud d en ly came up on the P C ' s back g r ound .
But I thought that is a or d in ar y p op .
S e x p op seemed to dis a p pe ar ed , but 1 5 second s la ter , it came up again .
I made a big mistake , I p ic k ed up a dis g ust ing sp y w ar e on J a p an e se p or n sit es .
If I c a n ' t find way of de le te this sp y w ar e by this morning , my l and la d y are going to find it .
If so , she would k ic k me out from this house .
So , I de s p er ate ly sea r ch ed how to de le te that .
My l and la d y c a n ' t understand J a p an e se , but her nephew is in ter m ed i ate J a p an e se speak er , may b e he can understand what this p op say .
One of them could give me some hi n t s how to de le te that .
M o st S ing a po e an friend s laugh ed me like `` You per ver ted , How c he e k y you are , This is not your P C but your l and la d y , Why did you do that ? `` .
M or e o ver , my l and la d y ' s P C c a n ' t ty pe J a p an e se , I could not sea r ch i nformation about that .
I like the He ll o K it ty very much ,
I just like that she do n ' t have mouth . . . .
B e c a us e of her us e heart to co m m un ic ation , and need not through any kind of language s .
A n y way I start s to us e this sit e though in a w ful sit u ation
It happen ed l ot s of pro ble m s one after another since a f e w days a g o .
So J a p an e se go ver ment made a di c is ion to stop pro v id ing e le c t ri c ity in Ka n t o dis t in c t , even includ ing c a p it al c ity , since tomorrow .
The e ar th qu a ke happen d f re qu ent ly even now .
I tri ed im a g ing our life in J a p an after tomorrow , We will be in de f in e t ly different world with ever .
We must also be strong er than ti ll now and We need s l ot s of help .
H o pe to know many people here .
If some body interest ed , just j o in me !
To m or r ow , I am going to No r th C ar o l in a for the business meeting which is he l d in ter n ation ally every two month s b a se from the last year .
The meeting s re c ent ly have been he l d in E ur o pe , and I mi s s ed the last one in U S A .
So , it ' s act u ally the first time to go to U S A for this meeting .
It has been almost five year s since the last time I went to U S A .
It ' s ex c it ing , and I want to shout `` we are the un it ed state s of A m er ic a `` , though I am not .
F or a g en er ation as mi ne , U S A was sp e c i al when we were ch il d re n .
R i ch , a d v ance d , great , de m o c r at ic , free , it was de s c ri b ed something we J a p an e se a d m ir ed .
I have been to N Y , N J , F l or id a , and H a w a i i , all of which are the f a m ous c it ies for tra ve ling ex c ept N J .
My el d er s is ter once live d in N J , that ' s why I went there .
A n y way , I am look ing for w ar d to going to the c ity where I have not been .
I like sp or t s ( es pe c i ally k ar ate , t able ten n is ) . , tra ve ling , f il m s , p h ot o g r a p h .
I receiv ed c en s us en ve l o pe re c ent ly .
B ri t ish one is much more sp e c if ic than J a p an e se one .
I ch o o se to do it on line because I thought it would be much more e as i er and quick er .
It took me more than a half hour .
And I could n ' t finish it up because my P C was free z ing up at the last se ction .
I was al o m o st done .
She did it by hand writing .
I would like to do so .
I want qu it s m o k ing .
To day is so pretty day in K or e a .
good sh in e and good w in d made me ha p p y enough .
It ' s about c i g ar e t te .
I know c i g ar e t te make s me un he al th y though .
But It ' s hard for me to qu it it .
A n y way , for get ting i nformation about good effect s of qu it ting s m o k ing , I go o g led .
On the In ter ne t , There are a l ot of st or ies about c i g ar e t te .
F or ex amp le , In U S , F e m al e s m o k er is about 2 1 % , but In K or e a , about 4 5 % .
I gue s s it ' s im p or t ant in d ic at or .
As you know , there are many reason s of that big ga p .
S u ch as the p ri ce of it , str es s of each n ation ' s p op ul ation , education , e t c .
Even though , sit u ation in f l u ence s hu man ' s be ha v i or , we ( K or e an ) have to over c ome it any m or e .
( I ' m writing this te x t right ?
I want you to c or re c t my poor te x t right then I ' ll try to do anything as a le ar n er you could us e .
The se picture s was us p h ot o s .
Yes ter day we had a big show to all the students in our school that it has about 3 0 0 0 people ^ ^
In my me m or y , he was always great pro m in ent le ad er who never give in to .
He is always bu s y in his job , but he face s each me m b er of his family like other or d in ar y f a m il ies while he is home .
He has to per s u ad e to his d aught er that they c a n ' t play in the am us e ment p ar k ex c l us ive to w h ite people , or to explain to his w if e why he make s a de c is ion not to p re s s charge s against the ra c is t ' s at ta c k .
I gue s s his f le x i ble str e ng th is s te ad i ly ro ot ed in his family .
P le a se do n ' t mi s s to visit this p h ot o es s a y .
As there is nothing to do , I went to sit down before my person al comp ut er , p ow er ed it and l in k ed it to the in ter ne t ne t w or k .
When I was look ing up my G M A I L bo x , I found my friend P e ter . co ll ing ri d g e was on line , so I said he ll o to him and he re p l i ed back to me soon .
D ur ing the con ver s ation , I found he is much interest ed in C h in e se and C h in e se c ul ture .
He felt it was very difficult to id ent if y so many new C h in e se w or d s and to understand so much C h in e se c ul ture , but he change d his old mind a l ot about C h in e se country .
He said it was very interest ing and was e age r to tra ve l to C h in a in his free time .
O h , now I do n ' t have nothing to do unti l tomorrow .
So I would like to write my impress ion s of English , A ust r al i a and something .
P e op le who have t at t o o s were regard ed `` Y A K U Z A `` ( J a p an e se ma f i a ) by other people in J a p an .
The t at t o o s most A ust r al i an s have old English pro ver b s or w is e saying s , I do n ' t know why but most of them are b l u e .
M o st A ust r al i an s are not living in the c ity .
They do n ' t like c r ow d of people , so they are living in the sub ur b s .
On ly for e ing er s As i an people in p at ic ul ar are living in the c ity .
And There are pretty big C h in a town in the c ity , and I was be able to only he ar M and ar in there .
If there were not C h in a town in the c ity , S d ne y would los t act i v ity .
O f course this kind of town s are in J a p an and A m er ic a .
If you are in J a p an now , I re c o m m en d to go to `` Y o k o ha m a `` .
You will be able to see hu g e and be a ut ic ul C h in a town .
T h o se dis c ri c t s are not J a p an but C h in a as well .
You can eat ta s ty C h in e se f o o d as much as you want , but co st s are pretty ex p en s ive .
P ri ce is pretty ex p en s ive in s y d ne y .
I had thought p ri ce of J a p an is the most ex p en s ive in the world before I came here .
But A ust r al i an p ri ce is almost the same as J a p an e se ' .
I ha te the English a ir t c le s y s te m s .
So when a ver age J a p an e se students study English , we are al way s u f f er ing from the se di v il s l o l .
If English speak er s study J a p an e se , do n ' t us e the a ir t c le s y s te m s at all are difficult for English speak er s ?
C a n ' t English speak er s re al i z e J a p an e se no un ' s own er ?
C a n ' t they understand which J a p an e se no un talk ing about in each J a p an e se sen t ence s ?
I write a di ar y for the first time .
He ll o , I ' m s ant ar o u living in J a p an .
I write a di ar y for the first time at la ng - 8 .
I c or re c ted some people ' s di ar y a little while a g o .
I understand that a c or re c ting di ar ies was so interest ing for me .
No w in t ro d u ce myself .
I ' m a n at ive j a p an e se .
I ' m study English re c ent ly , p re p ar ing for To e ic / To f le t est s .
T h an k you for your read ing .
I like a b ro ad .
fond me m or y in P o l and
I at ten d ed an a c ad e m ic I T con f er ence , which is called I F I P , in P o l and when I was an un ive r s ity st ud ent .
W ar s z a w a in P o l and is very f a m ous as ho st ing the In ter n ation al F ry d er y k C h op in P i an o C o m pe t i tion .
We went to the re st a ur ant for dinner with four people and in ten d ed to or d er a s ing le p i z z a which would be sh ar ed .
To our surprise , however , four p i z z as were serve d !
P o l and ' s p i z z as were too large for us to clear our p l ate s .
This ex pe ri ence have me take the co m m un ic ation difficult y to my heart .
This is my first day and first po st at L an g - 8 , so I ' d like to explain about where my n ic k n ame came from .
I ' m called S u e C ha ng by my p ar ent s and friend s because `` C ha ng `` is wide ly us ed as a s u f f i x for you ng girl ' s name s in J a p an .
You can us e it for both any on e ' s s ur n ame and first name .
I think `` S an `` is a c k n ow led g ed as a English w or d in business scene s .
H a ve you heard ' F r a p p u ch in o effect ' ?
How of ten do you like co f f e e in a day ?
D o you think that co f f e e can di m in ish sleep ing ?
The reason is that B r a z il is ma x im um co f f e e co un t ri es of or i g in from the world .
In fact E th i op i a is the home of the co f f e e p l ant .
I do n ' t know the kind s of co f f e e .
No I have n ' t heard ' F r a p p u ch in o effect '
Some time s I dr an k co f f e e when a ter m of ex a m in ation .
Yes I think that co f f e e can di m in ish sleep ing .
I know it by my ex pe ri ence .
W o ul d you please c or re c t a comp o s i tion ?

O k , I ' ve had e ng l ish class es at school , and it help ed me a l ot , but it was most ly f o c us ed in writing and ma k ing t est s , nothing much like `` re al life `` .
My e ng l ish education was be s ed ma in ly in m us ic and v id e o game s .

To day ' s even ing , ra in was f al ling f a st in my town .

I had f e w mi n u it s black o ut , because of my house was p ow er off .
A fter a while , the ra in was stop p ed .
I saw mo on through the c l o ud .
My ho st family was so kind , I have never for g ot ten them .
H o st mother was the w ome n who mi g r at ed from N e ther l and s and got mar ri ed to K i w i man and had three ch il d re n .
However when I stay ed with her , she had di v or c ed and was with one of her d aught er and two c at s .
I had a one be d ro o m with desk for study and close t .
We usual ly had me al s with them .
He r English was very clear and also she se le c ted easy English w or d s which I understand , so I was r ally ex cited to understand what they say and to us e English .
H o st mother some time help ed me to read English b ook s , I read al o ud the b ook , if my pro n un c i ation was wrong , she c or re c ted them and there were w or d s which I did n ' t know , she explain ed them in easy w or d s .
I felt my English got better than when I were in A u c k l and .
To day , I watch ed do c u ment a ly pro ble m on T V .
I do n ' t know whether the mean of it is different or not in a b ro ad .
I also have such im age .
I th o g h t we must not look at them with p re j ud ic ed eyes .
H i ll
Yes ter day , I went mo un tain c l im b ing with my da d d y .

In fact , T a i pe i is a b as in so there are great number s of hi ll s we can c l im b .
This time , we ch o o se a mo un tain called `` B i - S an ``
It is not very high and the walk ing p a th s are not long so it s u ite s the sen i or c it i z en to c l im b very much .
There were two p a th s c ir c ling around the mo un tain .

It was w or th y .
To day , I have a less on of H a w a i i an H ul a .

As we can see for B ri tain the t re n d d ur ing the fifty year s is up w ar d , the f i g ur e of p ri s on er s in c re as ed from about thirty th ous and people to just a b o ve six ty th ous and .
This is the only sit u ation with s te ad y ri se .

F or in st ance , in A ust r al i a first ly the f i g ur e of im p ri s on ment d ropped by 1 94 0 to about fifty th ous and people .
However , after this there was an in c re a se unti l 1 97 0 and then again de c re a se to about the same f i g ur e as in 1 94 0 .

To day , I enjoy ed b ow ling with my family .

And I could n ' t say what I want to say in English .
I went to dr in k with some fellow work er s yesterday .

One of them said that you have a very kind heart .

There f or e we need to change our ve h ic le s to us e no n - o il - b as ed f u el .
L a st s un day , I went to my friend ' s house to do a B B Q .
watch ing a b a b y gr ow ing up
One of the most be at ful things in the world is watch ing a b a b y gr ow ing up .
I am at home the se days , on the ho l i day of N ation al D a y .
he ll o guy s ,
`` K y le and n is me n were able to take a great many p h ot o g r a p h s of the mo un tain s be l ow . ``
so c c er is around the w ro l d .
I p a ly so c c er with my friend s .
I can t speak English but make friend who another country people .
I think the mind is con ve y ed if language not be con ve y ed .
I enjoy ed p a ly ing so c c er .
is it the te ch no l o g y le ad ed to the ga p between the poor and the ri ch ?
now , in the new mi ll en n i um , with s c i ent if ic te ch no l o g y in c re as ing ly a d v ance d and the dis p ar ity between the we al th y and the need y great ly en h ance d , some in d i v id u al s l in k the ga p to those a d v ance d te ch no l o g y ies .
however , from an e m p ir ical sight , I re ally hard - p re s s ed to im a g in e how the sp e c t r um of te ch no l o g y le ad to the we al th ga p since it go se without saying that s c i ent if ic te ch no l o g y re n d er s de c re a se of dis p ar ity between the we al th y and the need y .
to begin with , pro l if er ation of i nformation high way have take n po s s i b il ity to the poor to op er ate a ho st of things which are im a g in ed un re al i able two de c ad es a g o .
take to ur ing for ex amp le , before the in ter ne t in v ent ed , the only no r m for an in d i v id u al qu al if i ed to tra ve l is money , while at present day we can a p p re c i ate the l and s c a pe any where on the p la ne t or even on the mar s just v i a the in ter n ne t .
more o ver , it is w il d a c k n ow led g ed that the mo b il p h on e , as on of the most sign if ic ant in ve n tion s in twenty c ent ur y , is also tra n s f or m ed in d i v id u al s ' living into high ly e f f ic i ent and con v i ent , es pe c i ally for the poor .
p re s s ing a bo t t o m , we can con ne c t with any on e in any where , which in turn en ri ch pe e p le ' s life va ri ous and en able hu man ra ce enjoy ing living at different e c on o m ic st at us es .
I ' m listen ing the m us ic again .
The m us ic always keep my bra in act ive .
The answer is that I find English pass age s on sit es , I try to understand the mean ing and re m e m b er the new w or d s .
They in t ro d u c ed me to S k p y e and t aught me how to us e it p at i ent ly .
The f e ar of speak ing J a p an e se dis a p pe ar ed , this made me so ha p p y .
I want to be better .
But I c a n ' t almost listen to it .
it is very difficult for me .
S t ar ting new B l o g part 2
and w ow that ' s a great b l o g I think !
I re ally like her writing about how she st ud i ed and what did she feel d ur ing the pro ce s s .
through her writing I got a new mo t i v ation to start write my study b l o g .

' I need more time to study b as ic things ' that ' s what I always said to my s el f .
but the fact I done it .
The number was C h op in `` e t ud e op . 1 0 no . 3 ``
A bout 1 0 year s a g o , I p r a c t ic ed every day .
So , I c a n ' t mo ve my f ing er s s m o o th ly .
every day night , I went out .
It ' s so b or ing and my time is p it i ful .
I ' m not so bad now , but not f l u ent enough .
The pro ble m is the co st and the effect .
I can read easy English like this ar t ic le f a st , but more difficult ar t ic le s , like new s p a p er s , make me di z z y and dis c o ur age d .
I gue s s I need much more v o c a b ul ar y and a large am on t of read ing .
I have been study ing for all after no on
and then I went to a l i b r ar y to return b ook s
be c a ous e I run out strange things
I have to walk ed around . . . . what my l u c k 1
I re m en b er that I ha v n ' t been con t at ing to my bo y f ri en d since long long a g o
I wonder if he has n ' t feel for me
I always believe that one day we ' ll be to g e ther
I so mi s s him . . . . .
I feel like to alone . . .
I have had a pai n in the c al f for a long time .
It ' s for t un ate that ra in y sea s on has already come .
A fter all , if I did n ' t have a pai n , I could not run outside because of ra in .
I have to k en charge of all ar an g e ment s of an in - comp an y train ing .
I felt the difficult ies as a mo d er at or because the meeting was got compli c at ed !
R e la x in my house
To day , I en j o i ed much time in my house unti l my work start s at 5 p m .
I l o ve my house because it get s a l ot of s un s h in e , so I can be re la x ing with a c up of co f f e e there very well .
E ver y day , my works start e ar y morning such as , at 6 : 3 0 a m , so I go out before da w n .
A fter eat ing l un ch .
I went to the m us ical in st r u ment s sh op to re p a ir my u ku le le .
When I went to H on o l ul u in H a w a i i more than 2 0 year s a g o , I happen to find this one .
I was consider ing whether to p ur ch a se this one or not d ur ing H on o l ul u .
B e c a us e this u ku le le was so ex p en s ive .
But , however I f in ally made up my mind to p ur ch a se this one .
This can express a va ri e ty of sound from L o ve B al la d ' s t un e to per c us s ive t un e .
I l o ve play ing this one and I was sat is f i ed with this to ne .
As my u ku le le is easily out of t un e re c ent ly , I asked a c r a f t man to change pe g s .
A t present my favor ite u ku le le is under re p a ir .
I am im p at i ent for return ing one .
Yes ter day it was ha il ed in S ha ng ha i .
O b v i ous ly the we a ther has being s um m er .
A fter ha il st on e it was very co o l ness outside .
but not long after the s k y was becom ing dark . . .
like d the night .
A t that time was at p m 4 o ' clock .
L a st it was ra in ing .
So big ra in !
And at 1 8 o ' clock I had the J a p an e se class .
And there was a tra f f ic j a m s when I was going to school on the ro ad .
L u c k i ly I we t a little .
B e c a us e it was ra in ing so he a v i ly when I was on the bu s .
And as I get old er , there is an in c re as ed re s k .
My hu s b and suggest ed for me to mo ve .
It is in te le st ing .
J a p an e se is not understood by almost all people in the world .
But mathematics is understood by all people in the world .
We first me t in U n ive r s ity when I was fresh man .
we could be easily close to each other because we had many things in co m m on .
S in ce we f ri st me t , we have sp ent a l ot of time to g e ther because we are at the same un ive r s ity and we have always take n the same course s .
He always smile and it make s me smile too .
But , One day , I heard that he b ro ke up with his girl f ri en d s ud d en ly .
I could n ' t believe it at first because they have had a very good re l ation s h i p since I me t them first .
On the day I heard this new s , I sp ent all night with him to co m f or t to him .
My favor ite sub j e c t is J a p an e se , es pe c i ally mo d er n J a p an e se writing for follow ing reason s .
N e x t , I like read ing and and writing a ha i ku po e m .
T h ough a ha i ku po e m is very short , it has a pro f ound mean ing s .
That ' s why study ing J a p an e se writing make s me interest ing .
I have been having a con st ant head a ch e the se days , es pe c i a ll h y when I he ar loud voice s .
I s it because I am have a co l d or something wrong with my body ?
On my way to home
To day im going to see b a se b a ll game at J ing u st ad i um with my s is ter .
As I w ro te on a previous day , we are C h un i ch i D r a g on s f un .
This is second time s that we go to see to g e ther .
I l o ve to p l an b ir th day part ies for my ch il d en !
Even if it is a l ot of s n ow outside !
sp r ing time ; )
A a a h h h I c a n ' t believe it , but sp r ing is coming here : D O f c it ' s still s n ow , w in d y and - 3 de g re es . . but the b ir d s are s ing ing , s un is sh in ing and every on e ' s s m il ing .
I like sp r ing . . .
It ' s time of l o ve & ro m ance , do n ' t you think so ? ^ ^
E ar l i er , sp r ing came here just after M ar ch ( even on my sp r ing va c ation I went s k i ing and it was nature s n ow there ! ) And now just on 1 st of M ar ch the we a ther has change d : after such a co l d and dark days came sp r ing days : D
But they say this we a ther w o n ' t be long , and already on 1 0 th of M ar ch again will be co l d and not p le as ant outside = (
A a a h h , on 8 th of M ar ch is our in ter n ation al f e m al e ' s day .
H o pe the we a ther will be good !
I have been le ar n ing v o c a b ul ar ies with this sit e ' s m ar t .
So I will write a something here .
B e c a us e she w on a co st um e con t est and got a new T V then she did not need old one .
However the old one is not so old , and we had not have a T V .
They want ed to go to M e ta ll ic a ' s live though did n ' t have ti c ke t s , so they attempt ed to b re a k into a ha ll .
I could n ' t help laugh ing when I saw this new s , because it was ri d ic ul ous .
The other day , I tri ed to bu y a live ti c ke t of a r ock b and , but I f a il ed though I re ally want ed to go .
A f e w days la ter , I found the ti c ke t on the in ter ne t a u ction .
It s p ri ce ro se qu ad r up le .
I was at a los s whether to bu y it or not , and then , I de c id ed to do n ' t bu y it .
I think that my de c is ion was right as a re s ul t , because I did n ' t only to s a ve money but also to op po se an over ch ar g e .
S in ce I came back from C an ad a , I got a j e t la g .
I mean , I did n ' t me e t any on e to day ( even my room ma te ! ) so I ten d to be la z y .
If I want to still a w a ke , I can be .
It mean s , take s long time to re c o ver y to be a natural condition .
F in ally , I ' ve been l o o s ing a natural r h y th m as usual .
I have to re c o ver y because I will go to work on M on day !
L a st week , I me t a str an g th man .
I f le w on the ro ad , when I ar ri v ed home I did n ' t see that man .
We have sleep less days in this s um m er .
This was my ex c us e of to day .
I started read ing new s p a p er in English .
I sub s c ri b ed As a h i We e k ly for 3 month s as tri al .
It has many kind s of is s u es and or g an i g ed by the le ve l of difficult y .
I have not had enough v o c a b ul ar y to read it though without di ction ar y yet , but I will try to keep read ing for 3 month s .
I feel of ten ho pe s and f e ar s .
E s pe c i ally , I am un e as y about the future .
No w a day s , it have difficult y find ing a job .
So , I do n ' t know my f ut r ur e . . .
I would like to work such a big comp an y ! ! !
I b or r ow ed a b ook from the l i b r ar y at my un ive r s ity who se ti t le is `` Why the J a p an e se people c a n ' t speak English ? `` .
The a u th or show ed some reason s why they are poor at speak ing j a p an e se .
I would like to show 1 reason s of them .
The first one is they did ' t need to speak English for the past .
The reason why P h il i p p in and In d i an is they us ed to be a co l on y of A m er ic a of E ng l and and they have to us e English to live a s m o o th life .
M or e o ver , he state s the J a p an e se people has no clear go al to le ar n it .
I ho pe we have de f in ite go al and keep the mo t i v ation to study it .
A l P a c in o str o ke me as his as t on ish ing act ing in the mo v i e `` In s o m n i a `` .
A fter finish ing this mo v i e , I de e p ly felt p ar ad o x ical and could not draw a line between just ic e and bad .
On A l ' s ar ri v ing at this town , he be g un to come down in s o m n i a .
No t only did he has to co pe with in t ri c ate case but also face his un te ll able se c re t .
R o b in W i ll i a m s un e x pe c ted ly s w it ch ed a come d i an to a co l d - b l o o d k i ll er in this mo v i e .
So we have to tea ch them next S un day to get good s c or e .
I do n ' t like to work on ho l i day . , even if I get ex t r a money .
F ir t of your question s , I think most of p op ul ar sea s on s for w ed d ing is sp r ing .
I think it re ally a good idea for people look for a part n er .
My brother came with f l u two days a g o because he did n ' t want to tra n s m it f l u to his p re g n ant w if e and 2 - year - old d aught er .
So , my mo m took care of him for two days and she got f l u this morning . . .

In any case , it ' s a good new s for my business , because my start up is n ' t S N S .

I have le ar n ed this sub j e c t three year s .
I re ally respect two person , And re w k r ame r and C as s id y B ish er .
A re they p op ul ar in the U .
I s there more p op ul ar than them .
B y the way , The world is a wide place .
No limit t al ent .
To day , I took my w if e and her mother by c ar to a conc er t of a l o c al ch or us gr o up .
I like ma k ing a l ot of no is e with m us ical in st r u ment s , but I am not good at s ing ing and can not understand the people who start s ing ing regard less of where they are .
However , my w if e and d aught er s be l on g to ch or us c l u b s , and I have been o b l i g ed to sp en d my free time for them .
L ad y G a g a is one of my favor ite ar t is t .
I was surprise d when I saw her picture ar ri v ing in Tokyo .
It is we ir d : ) M a y b e she asked c a b in at ten d ant s to write J a p an e se me s s age on her ex p en s ive b a g in the p la in l o l She also said when her f un s saw her in J a p an , please write me s s age on her b a g .
To day , I am going to go to p h o te sh op to be take n my family ' s picture .
I may dress on a s u it .
My do g includ es in my family .
My do g ent er s the p h ot o to g e ther .
I write in English since 4 year s , so may have many
I ' m a me d ical st ud ent , and I ' ll get do c t or ' s l ic en se on F e b r u ar y / 2 0 1 2 .
It ' s very reason for le ar n ing English .
M ed ical ex a m in ation
I had a bad re s ul t last year so I regard ed about my body .
I ho pe I want to get the good re s ul t this year .
A ch ance for le ar n ing English ! !
But after gradua tion , I almost did n , t see it .
So I for g ot l ot s of w or d s and id i o m s .
R e c ent ly I have started teaching of English for my d aught er .
She go to English less on by n at ive speak er a day for a week .
And at home , I let her le ar n ing English too .
F or ex amp le , read ing her picture b ook s , watch ing D V D s , play ing C D s d ur ing her play ing .
Some time s she talk s a English w or d .
However I can listen English a little , can not speak .
B e c a us e I st ud i ed English only for the entrance ex a m in ation for un ive r s ity .
I think now is the time for start ing to le ar n English again !
When I was gr ow ing up , I strong ly a d or ed little c re a ture s such as in se c t s and fish .
P er t ic ul ar ly , I was in f at u at ed with be e t le s .
A fter we got them , we would of ten put them in case s to hold in our house .
I like d to see them s u c k s a p s we f ed and o c c ation a ly fight head to head over s a p s or f e m al es in the p la st ic case at night as they are usual ly no c t ur n al .
It was as if they had show ed me a mi n i a ture world that made me th ri ll ed in the small p la st ic case .
F ish ing was also my f a b or it act i v ity when I was in e le ment ar y school .
No w I ' ve gr ow n out of that kind of things .
I ' m do ing my house h o l d account s .
But I c a n ' t s a ve money .
E d u c ation , f o o d and incident al co st . . . .
I have no know n cause .
I do n ' t want to was te money any m or e .
It ' s my a im for coming year .
I am the first gra d er of the gradua te school now .
A ll become in e v it able .
On the other hand , I ' ve heard that a l ot of students ex c ept J a p an look for the ent er p ri se after their commen ce ment ce re m on y , and some people act s by the volunteer for one year , or other s tra ve l around the world .
I s this sen t ence for business letter O K ?
We receiv ed your letter regard ing the p ot at o ch i p s you p ur ch as ed had mi l d e w in the k i b ble and then you receiv ed poor c ust ome r s er v ic e from us .
F or ex amp le , in J a p an , where I c ur r ent ly live , there are dis t in c t four sea s on s .
On the other hand , I am sure I would get b or ed with the mo no t on y of having the same we a ther year around .
I think it is better to have a c ity life than to have an ur b an life .
A l th ough some people insist that an ur b an life is s a f er , heart w ar m ing , and friend ly with nature , there are more de m er it s comp ar ed with a c ity life .
That is why the people who want to live in a c ity has in c re as ed more and more , and that of ur b an has de c re as ed ra p id ly .
I have both ex pe ri ence of living in c ity and ur b an .
E ver y time I re m in d of the days of living in the country s id e , I can not help but feel i ll .
S e c on d , the mo d er n ar t ex h i b i tion or conc er t would never be he l d in a small town that I live d so that there were little op p or t un it ies for a country girl to enjoy ar t .
C on t r ar y to my s is ter , who was living in a c ity , I had to take a long dis t ance bu s to watch the show s and conc er t s I l o v ed .
T h us I had to sp en d much money and time to follow my ar t is t ic ho b b y .
That may be the be st reason I mo v ed to c ity after w ar d .
F in ally , d u e to the close d en v ir on ment , there were f e w people who mo ve into or mo ve out from my little v i ll age .
F or that reason , all the me m b er s of my e le ment ar y school , j un i or high school and high school were comp le te ly same .
There f or e no hu man st im ul ation ex is ted there .
To comp ar ed with such a ter ri ble life in ur b an .
I am enjoy ing my un ive r s ity life in c ity very much .
W al k ing and ri d ing a b ic y c le would take me any where I want , and the ex h i b i tion s and conc er t s will be he l d almost every week end .
It is p ar ad is e for such ar t is t ic person as me .
M or e o ver I made many new friend s who have different thought s and ro ot s then we can st im ul ate each other .
F or those reason s , I de f in ite ly prefer a c ity life to a ur b an life .
S ur e ly this was one of the most st up id thing I did in the past 3 year s .
I like to read before going to sleep , so there is a p i le of b ook s at the head of the be d right be s id es my p i ll ow .
I rolled the she e t and other she e t s and p i ll ow case s to g e ther and took them down st a ir s to put into the was h ing machi ne .
I open ed the l id , took one she e t out and f o l d ed it r ough ly and put it in the b as ke t .
There was something that never go es with a la un d ry machi ne .
I was h ed my ce ll p h on e in it !
As you may know , the last thing you want to do when you dr op your ce ll p h on e in water is to try to turn it on .
B e c a us e there ' s water in the c ir c u it , it will short out at the moment it turn ed on .
In s te ad , you should take out the b at ter y and S I M c ar d im m ed i ate ly , un c a p all the c a p s for the p or t s , and w r a p it with a to w el and sha ke well to re m o ve water .
A fter that you can f in ally b r ing it to the re ta il sh op you b ough t it .
I knew it , but the know led g e did n ' t come in hand y .
A fter all , my poor ce ll p h on e had been so a k ed in so a p water for more than 3 0 minute s .
But wait , I thought , `` As it ' s under g on e the sp in dr y c y c le , it may dr y quick ly and I could at least s al v age the da ta on it ! ``
Well , I ' m not sure that ' s tru e .
No w I ' ve wait ed for three days so it can be comp le te ly dr i ed , I ' ll b r ing it to a near b y A U sh op .
I ' ve us ed it for two and half year s now and particular ly like d the di g it al came r a like appear ance and f e a ture s .
I ' m a house w if e now so I do n ' t have a job but I do have a house h o l d ch or es .
Some time s they are both er to do but most of all I like them .
This morning , a in s ur e ance lady visit ed at my house and off er ed me a same job she does .
I have a b a b y bo y and a 3 y e ar s girl and I do n ' t want to have a job yet .
That was very an no ing .
B e c a us e I think house h o l d ch or es are hard job , too .
This p h on e has a sp e c if ic character : came r a is made by S O N Y with high qu al ity .
I will go to No v a S c ot i a in C an ad a this we a k , so , if I would have some ch ance s , I would us e it .
E s pe c i ally , l o b s ter s !
I ' m la y ing in my be d and ty p ing it on my ce ll p h on e .
F or now it ' s more like a middle of O c t o b er rather end of A u g ust .
I I even had to put on a ha t ( which I w is e ly keep in my j a c ke t ' s in n er pocket ) this even ing when I was return ing l ate from my girl f ri en d .
My e ar s would free z e to he ll had n ' t I done it .
It is first time `` T an g o no S e k ku `` for him .
It ' s put up c ar p str e ame r s or display im it at ed J a p an e se ar m o ur and sword , we call it `` K o d o m o no hi `` .
The first time , It ' s old even t at the N ar a per i o d , To day is the turn of the sea s on , It ' s have distribute d the me d ical ha r b to a v o id sick ness and mi s f or t un e .
And G en er al ' s ch il d is con g r at ul at ed at the To ku g a w a sh o g un ate , The me d ical her b is p ic k ed of dis pe l e v il spirit s that T an g o ' s even t is thought , It re la ted to the ce le b r ation of the bo y ' s b ir th .
I will eat A ri ce c a ke s w r a p p ed in o a k leave s and A ri ce d um p ling w r a p p ed in bamboo leave s .
I think he w an n a eat .
W h i ch is the c or re c t sen t ence ?
I write a letter by my p en c il .
as u know , or not : )
I started this pro g r a m to day
and im writing second di ar y already ! !
I thought this pro g r a m help p p l who w an n a im p ro ve their la g u age s k i ll z
most e ng l ish di ar y is b r us h off ! !
no one take care of us ha ha ha
I mean , us , y e a us
gr ow man , not a girl
E N G L I S H guy s only care girl s l o l
da m . .
may b e , im not b l ame that kind of guy s x D
just w an n a make f un with this tired of st ud ing la g u age
y e a I know this l on e ly di ar y also can help my st ud ing
it s o k if no body watch and f i x my di ar y
i ll keep work ing on
first thing is im p or t ant for education is know le g e .
E d u c ation give s us the know le g e of the world around e ar th and a ro ud us .
It help us to bu il d ch o ic e of view for e v ry things in our life .
E d u c ation is not about less on s , po e m s , and te x t b o x es .
It is about less o s of life .
L ate ly , I have comp le te ly los t interest in study English .
I c a n ' t conc ent r ation and I am im p at i ent about myself .
But I do n ' t want give up to study English .
So , I thought the reason why I have los t interest in study English .
One of the cause is tired of ro ut in e works .
I need new ro ut in e .
M a y b e It will be good p r a c t ic e for me .
But , I ' m not sure about that I can keep on it or not .
What do you do when are you tired of ro ut in e works and what is your favor ite way to study English ?
If it is possible , my who le le c ture would di e .
A g a in A ul er , this guy would never stop p ed .
This is a ma t ri x s c re w ed up .
Besides , I think he still speak s very hu m b ly .
He always speak s like , `` Let me bra b r a b ar a , `` or `` P le a se all ow me to bra b r a b r a . `` I can le ar n many things about both English and mathematics from him .
He was e i g h ty year s old and mar ri ed her when they were 3 0 and 3 2 .
He was a st ud ent at his age and , de s p ite that , she de c id ed to get mar ri ed to him because she thought `` in st in c t ive ly `` that he was the right man .
I just thought that would be my per f e c t de a th .
I ' ve just re m e m b er ed that now .
And now I am a very l u c k y man after all .
I ' m sit ting under the k ot at s u , and I at e or an g e .
It ' s very ha p p y time for me , es pe c i ally in w in ter !
There are a l ot of s n ow in w in ter .
I need friend s being around me , g i v ing me w ar m care to dr ive f e ar away . . .
I need l o ve that can mo t i v ate end less str e ng th from de e p inside my heart . . .
after 5 . 1 2 e ar th qu a ke she was sen t to this school by her p ar ent s - - my s is ter and brother - in - law , because they have not enough time to take care of her .
The eat th qu a ke made them c r a z y : the te m p or ar y p la st ic house is ve y hot in s um m er and very f ri g id in w in ter , and they are so bu s y with their works that no one can watch the kid .
A t first they want to find a b a b y s it ter to take care of the kid , however , no one want s to take that job because of bu s y with their own business .
F in ally they have to sen t her to a boarding school which is almost 2 0 0 k il ome t re away from their town , and this is the near est school from the town .
Yes ter day I called my n i e ce , and she told me she will sen t me a new year c ar d .
I a k s ed her what she most want in the new year .
she is only 7 y e ar s old and she have to be ar many things which be y on d her age .
I know her wish will not come tru e in the next year , because they still have no new house .
I ho pe there will no such wish any m or e and every ch il d can stay to g e ther with his / her p a p and m um every day .
As the B e i j in O ly m p ic s started a f e w days a g o , and I think many people are interest ed in this to p ic !
I watch ed the ra ce , it was very ex cited , I want him to got a another me d al in 2 0 0 me ter s b re a st st ro ke !
But R y o k o T an i co ud n ' t got a go l d me d al , but she got b ro n z e me d al .
`` D ad d y , you have to co un t 1 0 before you get out of the bath t u b `` she said .
I went to N as & D a m i an M ar le y J a p en To ur yesterday .
they perform ance d about 2 h o ur s .
it was so c r a z y night ! ! !
in the end of L ive , D a m i an s an g `` C o ul d you be l o v ed `` .
all c r ow d very ex cited ! !
Yes ter day I went to a b ook st or e with my A m er ic an friend and b ough t three paper b a c k s of `` The ch ro n ic le s of N ar n i a `` and other b ook with 2 0 per c ent off .
A fter I came home , I or d er ed what of left of `` The ch ro n ic le s of N ar n i a `` and who le C D a ud i o b ook s of them from A m a z on .
A l th ough that we b s ite is J a p an e se sit e , I think I can ma in tain mo t i v ation to read paper b a c k s in English .
There f or e , I up d at ed it on my b l o g .
A fter I read paper b a c k s , I can put them on my b ook s he l f on line .
When I look at the number of b ook s on my b ook s he l f , I would be ha p p y because I can make sure the number of b ook s he l ve s .
I will write re v i e w in English after I read paper b a c k s in English .
I ' m sure that writing re v i e w in English is de f in ite ly good for me to p r a c t ic e to express my feel ing s or thought s in English .
A l th ough I put se ve n paper b a c k s on my b ook s he l f on line , from now on I want to in c re a se the number of b ook s .
You can ch o se de ta il of sit u ation : you already finish read ing , from now on you will read and right now you are read ing .
In my case I have n ' t settled up my b ook s he l f thought .
A fter la ter I will set t le my b ook s he l f .
If you are interest ed in the we b s ite , I suggest you us e it .
They se ll it e m s like s n a c k , al c o h o l , and b ent o bo x .
O ri g in ally , a conc ept of con ve n i ence st or es came from the U .
S . , a con ve n i ence st or e was such a success ful business .
S in ce I came back to J a p an , I stop by a con ve n i ence st or e more than three a day .
A c t u ally , many friend s I had do se n ' t keep con ta c t with me .
I will do e ng l ish study ~ on this year

It did n ' t ra in ed in the morning after all , so we pack ed our b a g .
we will going to go to the mo v i e the at er the day after tomorrow .
It ' s we ir d but I was look ing for such w or d s for a long time and b e ing close to them .
And f in ally I can say I p u z z le it out !
T h an k you for down l o ad ing this ma g ic w or d s .
S e as on 1 and sea s on 2 .
I had watch ed it last year by D V D , but by ch ance it was a ir ed on te le v is ion .
It was very ex c it ing , so I watch ed it 1 5 e p is o d es in one st ting .
I like almost his m us ic , and there is a piece of m us ic of him `` s m o o th c ri m in al `` .
It is f a m ous and a j a un ty r h y th m m us ic .
I live it , but I wonder that n at ive s who speak English like the so ng because I think the w or d s of it is not so en ri ch ed .
I want to pass second gra d e of a i k id o in A p ri l .
No , it sound s like difficult .
So I W I L L get it in th is year because
I want to put ha k a m a .
So much paper work to do .
I sp en d the who le day to face the comp ut er .
I think I hu r t my should er .
The year end part y .
We at e S p an ish dis he s , it was so de l ic i ous ! !
And I sp ent about 4 0 0 0 y en for the c a b ! !
I ' ll be care ful not to dr in k too much . . . .
C o ll e g e dr in k ing with j un i or year s
I am a second year of m aster course st ud ent .
To day we he l d the co ll e g e dr in k ing .
T h ir d year students have to de c id e the la b to j o in .
But they do n ' t know about each la b much .
It is a ch ance of he ar ing about la b s which may do m in ate their live s after gradua te .
A st ud ent think much of free time .
A st ud ent think much of what he / she can study .
A st ud ent take co un t of p rofessor ' s person al ity .
I brought back the past when I was in this sit u ation .
he ll o !
I w an n a speak English !
L it er ally no mo t i v ation to do anything , so I w an n a have some m us ic and mo v ies in s p ir ing me and ma k ing me c al m !
D o you have any re c o m m en d ed stuff ?
The J a p an e se tax ter ur n s te p s are very simple .
In J a p an , most of the s al ar i ed people do not need to do their tax re p or t s by themselves because the comp an ies do on be h al f of the e m p l o y e es .
The comp an ies f i ll in their e m p l o y e es ' s tax do c u ment s , and the e m p l o y e es c he c k and sign , act u ally write their name and st amp their sign e t s , on their tax do c u ment s to con s ent the do c u ment s are c or re c t .
The e m p l o y e es do not need ma th or hi re account ant s to get their tax return .
However , the people who are s el f - e m p l o y ed , l and l o ad ( l and la d y ) , or have certain ty pe s of ex p en se s , which must be over $ 1 0 0 0 , have to re p or t for their f in al in c ome tax return .
But s un n y day .
O ur c ity has been ra in n ing for s ever al days .
I felt so bad , e v ry th ing bad .
B e c a us e the se days was my last ho l i day s , I will go for work after a f e w days .
If it did n ' t ra in , I can go sh op p ing with my friend s , I can go to the p ar k for a f un day , I as l o can go to the c in e m a with my friend s .
B e c a us e the ra in , I only can stay at home . . . .
I cha ll e ng ed it many time s , but f a il so far .
I started L an g - 8 b l o g s er v ic e from 3 r d S e p .
I want to keep di ar y even if a short story .
The bu s k er
We have take n one and a half month s to co ll e c t i nformation about bu s k er s and to look for s u it able in ter v i e w e e of the de p th in ter v i e w .
Then we found M U s , a F re n ch man , who has live d in T a i w an for three year s .
He is a bu d k er play ing well a c ro b at ic s , usual ly perform ing in the square of X in y i V ies h ow .
This do c u ment ar y f il m we want to find the story behind s bu s k er s , like their past im es , another work ty pe or something be s id e street p re f or m s .
It ' s ex c it ing to di g a un k n ow story .
And it is also a ch ance for you to know how much you are l o v ed by the people round ing you .
In this point of view , b ir th day is a day to feel w ar m and l o ve , for both you and your family and friend s .
This is my first writing on this sit e !
I think this sit e is re ally us e ful for the people who study for e ing language s .
You know , D a ve M at th e w s who is le ad v o c al and g u it ar is t of D a ve ma t th e w s b and .
Yes ter day , I heard that he appear s on H ous e M .
e p is o d e on 2 0 0 7 from my friend .
I had watch ed this e p is o d e .
however , when I watch this e p is o d e at first , I do n ' t know him .
He r ul es an a ut is t ic s a v ant p i an is t in this e p is o d e .
his act ing is a w es ome ! !
If you like da ve ma t th e w s , you should watch this e p is o d e , H ous e M .
I like put e g g in s and w i ch , and I us e this too l when I make s and w i ch .
I call it `` E g g - G u i ll ot in e `` but he call it `` E g g - S l ic er `` , and also he insist ed that the name is s c ar y and I am the only person who call it `` E g g - G u i ll ot in e `` .
On this week en d , I ' m going to j o in the mar a th on ra ce w h ic e is first time for me to run 4 2 . 1 9 5 k m .
Even if I ra n half mar a th on five time s , I am an x i ous for the re s ul t of full mar a th on .
My t ar g e t is to finish the go al with in four - hour which is called S U B F O U R R U N N ER .
No w , I ' m a tea m le ad er of e k id en w h ch i is a re la y ra ce play ing by four person and run n ing five k il ome ter s every person .
I want to le ad to tea m the tri m p th , and so that , I want to have s up er i or re c or d .
want to make friend s from all kind of country
I come from C h in a and want to make friend s from all kind of country to le ar n language from each other .
If you also have the co m m on interest , you can a d d my m s n s and y _ j u ly @ live .
co m or s k y pe smile - smile - smile .
There ' re some a d v ant age and dis ad v ant age to c ar ry it .
In my opinion , I do n ' t think it ' s good idea because of some reason s de s c ri b ed in follow ing paragraph s .
B e f or e think ing about it , I ' d like to me n tion about a condition of id ent if ic ation s c ar d in J a p an .
A l th ough we have no comp ul s or y id ent if ic ation c ar d , there ' s two ma j or id ent if ic ation c ar d s .
M o st of the people in J a p an have a id ent if ic ation number of the re s id ent re g is t ry ne t w or k .
M o st of them are people who does n ' t have a dr ive r ' s l ic en se c ar d .
In follow ing paragraph s , I ' ll think ing about this to p ic with the two id ent if ic ation c ar d s .
F ir st of all , an id ent if ic ation c ar d can be the f t .
A c t u ally , many people are c ar ry ing an id ent if ic ation c ar d in their wall e t .
A l ter n at ive ly , it can be the f t by p ic k p ock e t .
Even if the id ent if ic ation c ar d it s el f are n ' t the f t , piece s of person al i nformation in the c ar d can be st o le n such as a d ate of b ir th day or an id ent if ic ation number .
To a v o id them , some say `` you should be care ful ! `` But , it ' s no us e for s k im m ing case .
In the re s ul t , your id ent if ic ation c ar d might be co un ter f e it ed and you can be in v o l v ed into c ri m es .
If it was a dr ive r ' s l ic en se c ar d , you c a n ' t dr ive any m or e unti l your l ic en se c ar d be re is s u ed .
So , the style of those id ent if ic ation c ar d is a le g a c y thing .
With those id ent if ic ation , we do n ' t need a c ar d any m or e so you can go any where without the c ar d and a u th ent ic ate by your s el f if you need .
A l th ough you c a n ' t take so much a d v ant age of the c ar d , it could have a da ng er ous p ot ent i al to your life .
H o pe ful ly , many people would a c k n ow led g ed an a d v ant age of an a d v ance d te ch no l o g y like b i ome t ri c s and we could have a me ri t of them in the near future - - - s a f er and s m ar ter life .
He is going to study a b ro ad to Tokyo in this a ut um n to next sp r ing .
He and I some time s try to talk through S k y pe .
We are n ' t well so much to us e for e i g n language each other .
Some time s we must stop our con ver s ation and I should say like `` u u u a a a `` .
However , I ' m feel ing his e age r ho pe to le ar n J a p an e se .
T h ough he is you ng almost like my so n ,
I re ally respect him and his p ar ent s who sen d their l o ve ly kid to
un k n ow n my s ter i ous country that people l o ve to eat the e el .
I am look ing for w ar d that he ' ll ar r ive to J a p an and to talk direct ly
though I ' ll say `` u u u a a a `` .
O f course we must go to the J a p an e se re st a ur ant to eat the e el .
P le a se take care of the long tri p , and I say we l c ome again .
We did water m el on b re a k ing after l un ch to day .
So it was so hot to stay outside around 1 p m , and I was s w e at ing a l ot .
but more than that , the water m el on was re ally sweet and it ' s good to see ch il d re n ' s big smile ! !
Some of them could n ' t eat water m el on before , or never tri ed before , but now they know that water m el on ta s te good ! ! !
I me t an ent re p re ne ur who run n ing the comp an y in same in d ust ry .
We saw e y e to e y e on that the mo b i le a p p s like i P h on e a p p l ic ation will im p or t ant for us .
I think that it will be more ri ch as us ing 3 D comp ut er gra p h ic s .
One of my co - work er is going to transfer to other bra n ch ,
and we ga ve a farewell part y to night .
So I was very dis a p po in ted to he ar the not if ic ation at first .
A t the part y , I was too s ad to part from him , and we c ri ed each other .
I went to the night mar ke t , which open every S at ur day at the c ity I c ur r ent ly live in .
The night of T a i w an is very bu st ling as day time .
The night mar ke t in my home t ow n end about p . m . 1 1 : 0 0 .
Some f a m ous night mar ke t s are con t in u ed unti l mi d night even more l ate .
The night mar ke t con s is t of many ve n d or s .
There are always c r ow d ed in the mar ke t .
There is a v id e o on the you t u b e for N i g h t M ar ke t s in T a i w an .
B y the way , I never see any f a c il m aster in the night mar ke t I have visit .
The most of number s of our gr o up had al t o g e ther at the we st of ga te in our school in the morning .
We we ar same c l o th what is de s i g n ed by us , so it is beautiful .
We went to a interest ing place where have a l ot of hi ll and tree by bu s .
The va ri ous act i v it ies can be play , such as hi ll - c l im b ing or fish ing and s w im m ing and so on .
A l th ough , the hi ll is n ' t high , we felt very tired as ar ri v ed hi ll to p .
We cha t what we to g e ther like and ho b b y and help with each other .
A ll of us is ha p p y when see beautiful scene ry .
There are I not only visit ed a temple where have a B ud d ha who lie into hi ll to p but also took p h ot o with my friend s .
We had a p ic n ic near b y ri ver in after no on .
Some people b ough t f o o d and some people p re p ar ed to f i re and other s play ed game s .
One of friend s and I c ook them , and it is very de l ic i ous for us to eat them .
We felt smile to sp re ad all of world , so it is a very ha p p y day !
When I a p p l i ed for it , I got a s er v ic e which new s p a p er is de l ive r ed for a month on free .
Then , The D a ir y Y o m i ur i is de l ive r ed every day from J un e 1 st .
However , I had n ' t read them because I had n ' t want ed to read them .
This even ing , I read it a little .
I have some good friend s , we have different ex pe ri ence and care er .
of life .
But we have same ho b b y - s ing a so ng .
W h o some on e was an no y ed in something , we were s an g so ng s at Ka la O k place in f re q ne c c y .
We us ed to a v o id r us h hour .
R e as on not only that co st is great , but also that time we can get good s er v ic e .
We tra s h ed away de c en c y , we s an g and dance d with a b and on .
We tea s ed each other , made j o ke and en c o ur age one another
A t that time , we c l o ud not be ro le of so c i ally any m or e , same like s mother and w if e and care er woman , and so on
We s an g so ng s again and again , all pass things had come in to our mind .
Some time , re g re t w on t con s o led in w or d s .
But can re la x into m us ic
I j o in in my class m ate s wish all of teachers in the world to ha p p y in T e a ch er ' s D a y .
The teacher give n me some a d v ic e to le ar n speak English when I was a middle school st ud ent .
She to u ch me to pro no un ce each w or d and some da i ly con ver s ation .
A l th ough , I was n ' t good at English , my teacher still speak each w or d and sen t ence to me and p at i ent tell me to pro n un c i ation s k i ll .
I will not for g e t everything about her help in my life .
In the future , I will be p ri d e of my teacher .
I respect T h o m as E d is on who is a great in v ent or in the U .
He was b or n in the middle of 1 9 th c ent ur y .
I ma j or ed in me ch an ical e ng in e er ing and I st ud i ed about the mo tion of hu man o id ro b ot .
When I felt difficult ies in my study , E d is on ' s f a m ous w or d s c he er ed me up .
That is `` G en i us is one per c ent in s p ir ation and 99 per c ent per s p ir ation . ``
He in v ent ed im p or t ant things such as p h on o g r a p h .
He also had a great ability to im p ro ve other s ' in ve n tion and make the in ve n tion wide us ing like e le c t ri c light bu l b .
In my un ive r s ity , there were very f e w people who have a t al ent of in ve n tion and man age ment .
I will hold my w ed d ing ce re m on y a week la ter .
I think J a p an e se w ed d ing ce re m on y co st high ly .
Why J a p an e se people us e so much money for the w ed d ing ce re m on y ?
O f course , at ten d e es for the ce re m on y will pay mean ing ful money .
I pai d 3 0 0 0 0 yen when I at ten d ed a w ed d ing ce re m on y of my friend .
R e c ent ly , people who do n ' t hold a w ed d ing ce re m on y has in c re as ed d u e to the re ce s s ion .
It co st l ow er than hold ing a ce re m on y .
But many J a p an e se think that they are re l u c t ant to de v or ce if they hold a w ed d ing ce re m on y with much money ! !
I had too th a ch e last night , so I go to d ent is t there is close to my office .
I surprise d at dis c o ver ing good look ing guy !
He is a d ent is t , too .
I a no y ed too th a ch e , but I 7 m look ing f ow ar d to going d ent is t next .
I ' m office work er .
I feel b l u e now .
This is my first te x t on this interest ing sit e .
My e ng l ish is ter ri ble .
A c t u ally s ever al year s a g o , when ex - girl f ri en d left me , she took it home .
I f a il ed it for the first s ever al time s though I was do ing better .
I ' m still s ing le , I ho pe some body to eat dis he s I would c ook .
A bout R and o m N um b er
A t the moment , It can make p se ud or and o m number s by comp ut er pro g r a m .
But in a re al sen se , it can not make comp le te r and o m number s .
If there are r and o m number s , I think it mean s that comp ut er will be con s c i ous comp ut er .
In J a p an , There are some l ot ter ies and p r ed ic ting l ot ter y number machi ne s .
A l m o st p r ed ic ting machi ne s is de ve l op ed by only easy r and o m pro g r a m and it is very ex p en s ive and sp ur i ous p r ed i ction .
The more some on e know s about r and o m , No one will bu y .
I some time s want to eat J un k f o o d .
F in ish ed school , I went s up er mar ke t and I b ough t p ot at o ch i p s and ch o c o l ate a l ot .
I at e it without eat a dinner .
I did n ' t have a l ot of money . . . ( I eat the good f o o d for my heart h rather than eat the J un k f o o d . )
B U T , I c a n ' t stop eat ing !
I dr an k and at e gr il led s l ic ed me at with my friend s yesterday .
I at e that too much , and dr an k , too .
I understood that w ome n are very compli c at ed .
I have to do many things for ma k ing my girl friend ha p p y .
I should p re p ar e my b a g g age s for study ing a b ro ad by now .
A ll my class m ate are better than I .
has more p at i ent for me .
B e c a us e of my S p an ish is too bad , so she did n ' t think she can p r a c t ic e
I think I should sh if t to another class , even I should pay ex t r a fee .
There in my un ive r s ity does n ' t have the course I need , so I might find a p ri v ate class which is n ' t in the un ive r s ity .
That ' all .
H i g h salary make s people to conc ent r ate their job .
A ccord ing to the new s p a p er I read re c ent ly , get ting high salary person pro d u ce high qu il ity good s than get ting l ow salary person .
F ur ther m or e , in my case , when I had work ed with l ow salary , I could n ` t get a interest to my job
S it u ation : E m a il to the first tra d ing part n er .
D e ar Sir s ,

But , it is n ' t va c ation .
The c amp of I ce ho c ke y tea m will take place there .
I ' ll have no time , but I want to eat sp e c i al l o c al pro d u c t s .

I will run Tokyo M ar a th on to day .

But I was got ten a question , while I watch the dr a m a .
A act or said `` what the he ll did the da m n d u c k do now ? ``
I got up at 9 a m to day , because I s l ept very l ate yesterday night .

T O K Y O is very far from here so I have ' n t see n him about for 1 0 y e ar s .
I answer d y es . . .
And he said he was in front of my house now ! !
I was very s ur p ri z ed to he ar that !
I just got up and still w or e p a j y a m as . . ( ^ ^ ;
I did not even have a b re a k f a st .
I thought he should call me e ar l i er than this .
He said he tra ve led around here and s ud d en ly thought th a if we were in the house , he want ed to me e t us .
A n y way he is very ch er r ful person , so we had a very good time .
O h , we had S U S H I again . . .
two time s a week !
This is my first time to write a di ar y in E ng l s h .
This is my first time to study a b ro ad , so I am very n er v ous ! !
I want to be able to us e English s m o o th ly , and I want to study English more and more .
So I begin to write a di ar y on this home p age , and I want you guy s to c he c k mi ne .
I am now stay ing in my a un t ' s house in O a h u is l and , but my un ive r s ity is in the B i g is l and , so I ' ll mo ve there on A u g ust 1 5 th .
I will live in d ome with a room m ate who I do n ' t know to t ally .
The reason why I ' ll go to H a w a i i to study is I want to study in H a w a i i : - )
I have been here , H a w a i i more than ten time s , since I was two year s old , because my a un t and un c le live there .
Then , I ' m to t ally f as c in at ed by H a w a i i and became to want to live here and study here .
This is the time that my dr e a m will come tru e .

I went to n a il s al on last week en d .
It was my first time to go n a il s al on .
I have done my n a il s , and I re al i z ed that it is hard for me to do everything . . . .
F or ex amp le , I ' m work ing at office , so I am require d a l ot of ty p ing .
However , because of the n a il s , it is re ally hard to ty pe . . .
B e c a us e there is writing part in the ex a m , so I need to ty pe first and c or re c t ly .
I am wonder ing why a l ot of girl s like to do their n a il s even through it is hard to do everything .
To day , I ma il ed to same comp an y ' s s ta f f that de ta il is under follow .
`` C o ul d you tell me , How to change my business tri p s ch ed ul e that is pe t i tion ed to comp an y ? ``
Then s ta f f said :
`` You must get a u th or i z ation from your bo s s previous ly . ``
B as ic ally agree that respon se .
But It has no de ta il .
Then I think `` I do n ' t know future thing .
b as ic ally I want to do along to s ch ed ul e .
But That is future thing .
S O W E D O N O T K N O W T H E S C H E D U L E W I L L CHA N G E O R N O T ! ! ! ! ``
I sen t a me s s age a b o ve .
We feel the re g re t after sen d a me s s age . . . .
A little strong sen t ence .
So S ta f f receiv e my S T R O N G feel and they will get a ng ry or s ad .
This is to day ' s re g re t .
I need to think one more time at sen d ing a me s s age . . . . . . .
R e c ent ly I of ten got de p re s s ed .
But when I le ar n something to for e i g n language s ,
I can change of mo o d .
When I was st ud ent ,
Besides I can change my think ing when I us e for e i g n language .
Yes ter day , I knew some we b sit es for le ar n ing language and I was impress ed .
F o ll ow s are them .
We can le ar n ing language for free .
I think need take some g if t to him this f ir day , do you think a bo t t le of al c o h o l is a good idea ?
B y the way , I have s up p ri s ed since when I come to here .
It is about n an n y .
So there is many n an n y in the U S , but they are only little b it in J a p an .
B e c a us e you know , A m er ic an p ar ent s have work both of them .
And almost all J a p an e se w if e would stay at home .
A t least , I think J a p an e se still have di f f ic ul ly accept ing to come in the house e c c ept them s el f family .
So I have me t many most ly so u th A m er ic an n an n y .
I like them , and then I can study S p an ish : P he he
I am going to take to e ic at the end of the next month .
It is not possible to become a re g ul ar me m b er under the c ur r ent my s k i ll .
A l th ough very hard , but also very ha p p y .
I have an an x i e ty and a little s ad re c ent ly , because I am p re p ar ing my a p p ly do c u ment .
I p l an to go study a b ro ad next year , and U K is my first ch o ic e .
E ver y day , I stay in front of comp ut er to write down idea , but it is hard to me to express my thought clear ly .
B y the way , I have an English question : I want to de s c ri b e a j i g s a w p u z z le comp e t i tion , and it was con t in u ing 2 4 hour s .
How could I write a p p ro p ri ate .
We n t to S e o ul
I went to S e o ul to see My girl f ri en d .
We me t each other at G an g - by un st ation .
F in ally , We went to the B e ll o c a f e on the corner of G an g - by un S t .
My girl f ri en d ch o se G re en l at te and I ch o se H ot ch o c o .
A fter we finish ed our cha t ter ing , We went to eat dinner .
We had to say good by e to each other .
In front of the entrance of S u b way ' s do or , We were se p er at ed .
On my way home I could n ' t be as le e p because of get ting hot on my f o ot .
There was entrance of hi t ter be s id e of my f o ot .
A r ri v ed at home , There was no body at home .
I called my mother as soon as I c he c k ed that my mother was a b s ent .
My mother had go ne to in qu i re after my gr and m o ther ' s he al th .
I feel so sorry for that .
I wish My gr and m o ther ' s he al th y .
He ll o every body
This is my first not e in la ng - 8 , also is my f ri st time , im le ar n ing e ng l ish now , but I feel a little s ad , it s hard to what ' s I want to say day by day , and I do n ' t know how can I do better .
I ho pe I can give some on e help each other , and to be good friend s .
I want to in t ro d u ce an ar t ic le which was written about J a p an after a dis aster .
No w we are in the ra in y sea s on in J a p an on c al en d ar .
However , we had no ra in after that .
Some on e are glad to have less ra in , but other s are not glad .
I am afraid if water short age may be serious in this s um m er .
E s pe c i ally we will have to s a ve e le c t ri c ity in this s um m er .
L es s e le c t ri c ity , less water , and he at in s um m er will at ta c k us .

I went to my gr e and m o ther house with may da d .
To day I play ed j ud o game .
The game was started from 2 p m and play ed 2 5 play er .
I am small body but are con f id ent s ta m in a .
R es ul t s , I could take the b ro n z e me d al .
J ud o is very hard sp or t s but I ' ll try hard .
H in d i come s in the th ir d place in the p op ul ation of the n at ive speak er s , for ex amp le .
Well , I try ma k ing some sen t ence s and the them e is `` b ir th day part y `` .
- He is going to b r ing a y um m y c a ke at our office .
Yes ter day was my b ir th day and to day I brought pe t ite c a ke s and some dis he s at my office .
We at e to g he ther ( without our bo s s ) and my co ll e a gue s like d my dis he s .
The p h ot o of a c a ke is the last year .
hi .
n ic e to me e t you .
my name is s u j un g and I ' m 2 2 .
I live in se o ul .
I want to make for e i g n friend s .
I was b or n in the year of a s n a ke .
S n a ke character is t ic is straight f or w ar d .
E s pe c i ally money is im p or t ant thing .
But they are a ro man t ic is t .
They de v o te for their family .
They can dis c o ver about pro d u c t es s ence .
My favor ite an im al is ra b b it s , do g s , c at s and so on .
A c t u ally I like c ut e an im al .
I ha te a s n a ke .
E ver y time when I pro m is e other s to ful f i ll an as s i g n ment , I can a c c o m p l ish it very well even though the ta s k see m s un c on q er able .
M or e o ver , I am afraid to dis s a po in te other s rather than I myself .
If I not dr in k s her in the morning I feel myself tired and sleep y for a day .
I like di f f er ant co f f e e .
It is depend from my mo o d .
When I ' m s ad I dr in k c a p p u c c in o , when I ' m de p p re s s ed I prefer e black co f f e e .
I made up my mind that I sp ar e time writing ent ri es here for 1 0 mi n s every time .
If I sp ent time for 3 0 mi n s , my ent ry is always get ting long .
I know you do n ' t want to c or re c t such a long ent ry because when I read a long ent ry in J a p an e se , it is so hard that I do n ' t w an n a c or re c t .
I us ed to limit the time to sp ar e for ent ri es for 3 0 mi n s , but 1 0 mi n s is more in ten s ive and need s to conc ent r ate more than when 3 0 mi n s .
R e c ent ly , I ' m get ting us ed to this life style too much , thus , I ' n get ting la z y .
When I read a new s p a p er , I c a n ' t read well still now .
My listen ing s k i ll s are also still poor .
I heard that one of my friend s st ud ies for 1 0 hour s in a day .
O ther w is e , his English is not per f e c t .
To be like a n at ive speak er , of course p r a c t ic ing speak ing English is im p or t ant , but read ing s k i ll is also gra v ity .
It ' s time and I have to go to the class .
F ro m now on I will da re to speak English .
I ' ll us e on line a u ction .
I want to a game which is `` T H E i D O L M @ S T ER `` .
The play er ch o o se a girl and train to be a p op id o l .
I have never us e on line a u ction so I ' m n er v ous .
T h an k you for help of any of you in L an g - 8 .
W o ul d you tea ch me the mean ing of the sen t ence be l ow .
I c a n ' t understand it at all .
`` It k i ll s you to see them gr ow up .
But I gue s s it would k i ll you quick er if they did n ' t .
B ar b ar a k ing s o l ver , A n im al D re a m s ``
if possible , please change this sen t ence to another express ion .
T h an k you .
R e c or d ed `` M r . C l ock W as L e f t on the W a ll ``
I ' ve re c or d ed one of my ent ri es on You T u b e and I ' d re ally a p p re c i ate it if you could tell me direct ly what you could n ' t understand regard ing what I say .
There f or e , she has to c he c k the time every time she finish es watch ing her favor ite ch il d re n ' s pro g r a m `` A n p an man `` .
As I expect ed , she became interest ed in it and came to me in a hu r ry as soon as she found it on the wall .
C l ock , who want s to show you how to read the time , `` I re p l i ed , try ing to person if y it so that she could easily make friend s with him .
I did n ' t know why so bad de st in y s i z ed me last month .
One thing which I have said in my ent ry that I was found out when was help ing my friend to c he at in the ex a m .
I will return home t ow n in the l ate of this month and back to high school once again .
A no ther bad thing is about my second - hand b i ke , which I written an ent ry ( `` ch ance `` written on 1 5 th , S ept e m b er last year ) in which I explain ed how I b ough t it last year .
The st ud ent who se ll the b i ke to me st o le n the b i ke in a p ri l last year .
My class m ate L i u H a o and I b ough t the b i ke straight ly without ver if y ing the st ud ent ' s id ent if ic ation and re qu ir ing any con ta c t way s or re c or d s .
D a y s a g o , my class m ate D a i B o ri d e the b i ke outside and me t the re al own er who p ic k ed out the b i ke im m ed i ate ly when he saw it .
Then they went to the police st ation and L i u H a o and I went to there la ter to make a re c or d .
This is the first time I come to L an g - 8
I was said that this place friend will help each language
I want to im p ro ve my English , so I ho pe to receiv e your s help ^ ^
F ro m this moment I have been ? l is t
My dr e a m s came tru e ? we cause of you
There is nothing ? I will do give
It ' s time when many people make th i er pro v is ion s for the who le year .
I do n ' t like ma k ing pro v is ion s for the long per i o d so I will write one for this month only :
I ' m going to write al least 2 0 new po st s here by the one of J an u ar y .
K e e p your f ing er s c re s s ed ; )
I b ough t the new j e an s yesterday .
A c t u ally , I want ed to bu y the new train er s so I went to a sh op p ing c ent er .
There are a l ot of kind of n ic e sh op there .
A t this day , for t un ate ly , the b ar g a in s al e was hold ing there .
The mean ing is c he er H an s h in .
H an s h in is J a p an e se b a se b a ll tea m .
A n y way , I was look ing for the new train er s there .
However , I happen ed to find the n ic e j e an s when I ha ng ing around there .
The ir b l u e co l or was re ally n ic e , be s id es the p ri ce was reason able .
It was about 6 0 per c ent c ut .
I c he c k ed out the train er s too , but their p ri ce was n ' t c ut ting , so I b ough t the new j e an s .
I make sure not to ir ri t ate no r shout her .
However , it is difficult to keep my ten tion c al m when she see m s not to he ar me , or does the same mistake s .
I thought that I had to give her the reason able explanation to per s u ad e her why her a ction or w or d s are wrong in s te ad of just de n y ing her a ction .
M o st of J a p an e se usual ly do n ' t much take care of their re l i g ion .
However I think we depend on something with a a b s o l ut e p ow er in our in n er heart .
This re l i e f is our mo t ive p ow er to do the good a ction to other s if no body see s us .
I thought that ch il d re n also need s this kind of un d e f in ed but a b s o l ut e e th ic s .
So I took her to the ch ur ch where the s is ter s told ch il d re n the b i ble story interest ing easily .
Yes ter day , the s is ter told ch il d re n the story of a str a y she e p that run away from the gr o up , and got los t .
The she e p was f in ally found by the she e p h er d and felt re l i e v ed .
My d aught er of ten run away from me , so it is re ally good story for us !
I am B o o d d h is t , but un f or t un ate l ly the temple s g en er ally do n ' t give this kind of s er v ic e per i o d ic ally for small ch il d re n .
I wonder why they do n ' t make more effort for ch il d re n ' s education .
It must le ad to in c re as ing of the ent h us i a st ic B o o d d h is t s in the future .
hi ! all la ng - 8 me m b er S
I start to la ng - 8 to day
I ho pe English very well

P le a se call me `` ta ne `` .
I ' m we b de s i g n er , and con st r u c t we b sit es .
I ' m le ar n ing every day to be it .
L i ke a l ot of people are gr ate ful to those who want to be a we b de s i g n er .
de f f er ent world
I over s l pe t myself this morning .
I should have w a k en up at 7 : 3 0 a m , I w a ke up at 8 : 2 0 a m .
I put on g my c l o th es hu r ri ed ly and went out .
F o ur t un ate ly I am not l ate for work .
I had the de v il ' s my l u c k !
B e c a us e to day is the day I would going to the g u it ar sh op to bu y a new g u it ar .
I ' ve already de c id ed which one to bu y and asked the sh op man age r keep it .
It did n ' t took time for me to de c id e bu y ing it .
However , I did n ' t feel much pai n s on my f ing er s after play ing .
I comp ar ed my new g u it ar with old b ro k en one ( I w ro te about it previous ly .
It is light b r ow n co l or with n y l on str ing s . ) .
To my surprise , new one has a n ic e p ic k up s y s te m and I can do t un ing s quite easily !
When you p it ch the open str ing s , a light will turn to re d or gr e en and tell you the c or re c t position of t un er .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to my first g u it ar and voice less on on J un e !
And It would s c or ed . . .
A n s w er some question s about picture .
`` What Q u al it ies does person have to have to work in this place ``
And there was little talk about my ho b b ies ( L an g u age le ar n ing )
I do n ' t know how it ' s would be I will know at 1 9 J un e .
keep f ing er s cross ed : D
I j o in ed a la ng - 8 to day .
But , I do n ' t have writing a l ot .
I of ten s l ept to day .
But , I ' m sleep y now .
So , I study English every day .
I want to study a b ro ad .
I study hard .
I s this da ir y strange ?
B e c ous e I made a mistake .
A s a f e ty ti p for mo t or c y c le ri d er s about ra in y day
The per c ent age of mo t or c y c le ri d er s in T a i w an is un b el i e v able high .
A l m o st every my for e i g n er friend s were impress ive for the am o un t s of mo t or c y c le s f le e ting on the ro ad .
B e c a us e of the in s u f f ic i en c y for do m est ic bu s - ne t s y s te m , many people in ta i w an ch o o s ed mo t or c y c le s for middle dis t ance mo v ing .
But when you ri d ing a mo t or c y c le in a ra in y day , do not just only pay
your at ten tion to front side , but also be a w ar e of gr ound s .
Some pai n ted tra f f ic sign s written on gr ound s make it s l i p p y .
F l at pai n ted s ur f a ce without any f ri ction between ti re s and gr ound s is very da ng er ous .
If you turn a corner just on the pai n ted gr ound , you might los e your con t ro l of mo t or c y c le and f a ll down .
N e i ther mo t or c y c le s or c ar s , should not over s pe ed in a ra in y day .
The ma s s me d i a re p or ted that Y o k o ha m a B a y S t ar s so l d for an another comp an y last month .
However the is s u e of take o ver was b ro k en .
The other c ity was includ ed S h i z u o k a c ity .
When I heard the new s , if the is s u e was success , I think that I ' ll be able to watch the b a se b a ll game s near my house .
P le a se tell me W a k an a .
I want to speak English well .
When I speak English , I do n ' t know what I say .
So please tell me how to study S pe e k ing English .
The comp an y which I want to ent er regard English as im p or t ant , so I try to do that I can do everything .
There are two kind of people .
F is t part y of the people are afraid of give his / her l o ve for other people , because they think the one who give s more their l o ve always is hu r t at the last time .
A no ther case part y are just g i v ing their l o ve with no idea and c al c ul at ing .
They just believe more l o v ing can make more beautiful world .
Some people p re ten d it ' s O K with f a ke smile , when they are in front of some on e who do n ' t like them and i g no re them .
B e ing co o l ness is not good with f a ke smile .
B e ing ar d ent is not good with we a k heart .
J ust let ' s think G o d ( this un ive r se or what ever ) will pro te c t every on e includ ing me and everything is good . ( something is better , f e w is sp e c i al )
Then we can be co o l ness and ar d ent at the same time with a strong be l i e f .
there are no more hu r t just more l o ve .
1 ) You believe you need a l ot even more than you re ally need but if you got all that you ' ll los e your free d o m .
I return ed to the house , and at e the c a ke .
I come to want to eat sweet f o o d when becom ing tired .

And I present ed her with p u z z le s .

The do c t or said that the sick might be just `` he at str o ke `` , so that it was not serious for the c at .
I felt easy by he ar ing that new s from my you ng er s is ter .
My c at play ed outside my p ar ent ' s house around no on two days a g o and it was very hot then .
There f or e , I think he was he at str o ke .

The de s i g n is like a co in of re ver se .
O ut side is black and inside is w h ite .
It has w h ite ver t ical line s at h ing es .
It ' s s ty l ish , is n ' t it ?
I put it on yesterday .
My co ll e a gue saw my face and said `` You r g la s se s is c ut e !
It ' s look s like a p and a ! ``
I like p and a though I do n ' t want to become a p and a . . .
We can not live without water , but now we are now in da ng er of `` W at er C ri s is `` .
In the 2 0 th c ent ur y , the p op ul ation of the e ar th gr e w much big g er than it was in the 1 9 th c ent ur y .
A bout 7 0 % of the e ar th is co ver ed with o ce an s and about 3 0 % is con t in ent s and is l and s .
F a c t or ies need much fresh water to make pro d u c t s , and so much was te water come s out from them .
But that is still not enough to s up p ly the need s of all the people around the world .
The be st way to make a di f f er ence is to change our mind s and life s ty le s .
To day is a ti r ing day .
W as too b or ed to study also looked at the t est .
The we a ther is very hot .
A little b it an no y ed .
But how much t est ing left .
and h m m m I en v y that girl !
( I c a n ' t re m e m b er even though I just finish ed watch ing it ! )
when I us ed I - po d n an o , the better y of that would be re ally f a st go ne
but now when I us e i P h on e , the better y is long er than it !
so I could watch that even 1 0 e p is o d e !
without better y los t !
h m m with this I can cha t with many people who us e i P h on e with P ing a p p l ic ation , so I wish I could find more friend s who us e it . . . . . . . .
but I do n ' t know how I could : (
any way it was f un to day : P ha ha
I made a ro ut e ma p in my c amp us for my home w or k .
B e c a us e the s un set on the way , I c a n ' t finish my home w or k .
So I ' m finish ing the re st of my home w or k tomorrow .
D un no if I should say something to them . . .
2 of my co ll e gue s s m o ke inside the office .
But they never close the do or , so I can s m e ll it from where I sit .
What ' s w or se , my bo s s even s m o ke s right in front of me when ever we have dis c us s ion s , and I just do n ' t have the co ur age to as k him not to s m o ke . . . . .
I will study English hard er in or d er to go H an ku k U n ive r s ity of F or e i g n S t ud ies .
so I me m or i z e many w or d s , watch English dr a m a and English mo v i e without sub t it le .
also , I put in p op so ng s my M P 3 play er and I always c ar ry my M P 3 play er to listen to m us ic any time , any where .
The va c ation will end , I do n ' t have much time to study English .
so I study hard er d ur ing va c ation .
And we l un ch ed at M A C .
It was so f an : )
But , class is going to start at tomorrow !

I tri ed to return the C D play er in the sh op , where it had been b ough t , in or d er to re p la ce it for a new one .
However , a s al es man age r re f us ed me to ex change it and explain ed me that they did not provide a g u ar ant y , because it is respon s i b il ity of the man u f a c ture r .
I de f in ite ly need this sit u ation to be so l v ed and I want to get a new C D play er or the old one being f i x ed .

( R e ally , though I have re g is ter ed , I did n ' t us e the one b c a us e I thought my P C do n ' t have a mi ke .
But I found a mi ke with my P C yesterday ! )
The sit e is like the t w it ter .
D if f er ence point is only one .
It is at con t ri b ut e a voice .
It s name is `` c in ch `` !
I will p r a c t ic e those , listen ing and speak ing without a dr a f t , every time s l ow ly .
I was very ha p p y , because a l ot of people said me `` H a p p y b ir th day ! ! `` .
R e c ent ly , I was asked which train he should take by a middle - a g ed tra ve ll er on p l at f or m 1 5 at S in a g a w a st ation .
It ' s one of the big g est st ation in Tokyo and it ' s visit ed by more than 5 0 0 0 0 0 pass e ng er s a day .

I tell him that , and he said than k s to me , g i v ing a b it ter smile .
He had to w and er the big st ation a little long er with his s u it c a se looked he a v y .
The most impress ive place I went was A y ut th a y a .
It ' s such a p ity that I lack of p h ot o g r a p h ic s k i ll !
I w or ri ed about me that I ` ll take a to e ic b ri g e t est to m r r ow .
B e c a us e , I don ` t read y anything .
A n y way , I ` m read ing some b ook s now .

To day I ' ve thought that a ut um n had f in ally come .
It became co l d er out on the street and I ' ve re al i z ed that I have a b s o l ut e ly no will to go out .

No w I look a l ot better with my bang up on my for e head .
It will take a long time to make my bang down .
To day this was my work day .
This is a per f um e .
I told him `` No no I do n ' t need `` , but he seemed to take off en se and I took the g if t .
This is of course p le as ant ly , but I do n ' t understand why he did it . .

How to clear up a co l d
I stay ed my home all day because I had a little f ever .
My way to clear up a co l d is dr in k ing a en er g y dr in k before go to be d and take some me d ic in es .
I will also do it to night .
And I was ex cited to the s es s ion , as I never had ex pe ri ence d it before .
P e op le came in and two A m er ic an teachers did too .
One A m er ic an lady seemed to have many ex pe ri ence s of teaching , while the other A m er ic an man , who was very you ng , seemed just a gradua te of un ive r s ity .
O f course , the lady was good J a p an e se s k i ll s and manner , as she live d in J a p an for long time .
The s es s ion was started .
F ir st , J a p an e se ch il d re n show ed he s it ation and they were ant s y .
But soon all of them were c a p ture d by the voice from the A m er ic an lady , that she read a b ook of H a ll ow e en p um p k in s .
I did n ' t think the small kid s be able to conc ent r ate on for a while .
S ur p ri s ing ly , al th ough it was the same language and two teachers ' read ing were not so different , the ch il d re n be ha v ed different ly .
( it should be done ! ) . `` while , The re st was listen ing quiet ly .
I b ook ed T i o man B er j a y a re s or t in M al a y s i a for ho l i day s .
A ll of my S ing a po re friend s stop p ed my family from going there because of M on s o on .
M on s o on start s in No ve m b er and our tra ve l is from 9 th of No ve m b er to 1 1 th .
But we need some re fresh ment and are read y to enjoy M on s o on full y .
One of my p l an in this year is run n ing full mar a th on in four hour s .
I run to work almost every day , and also run to home from work .
It is ra in ing sea s on now .
I do n ' t run on ra in y day , so I feel s ad without run n ing .
We have only one month left to enjoy watch ing f ant a st ic so c c er game s .
ti ll now , K or e an play er s have been do ing their be st for ma k ing a mi r a c le again like the 2 0 0 2 K or e a & J a p an world c up .
A l ot of f an s of so c c er in the world do n ' t try to accept our re s ul t in 2 0 0 2 .
I can understand why they do like that .
However , we should enjoy world c up as just in ter n ation al f est i v al .
I also believe that K or e an play er s will show all for e i g n er s K or e an ' s p ri d e and they will make a mi r a c le again .
Red de v il s ?
P ar k j is un g ?
or else ?
As soon as the world ic up start s , all K or e an s will we ar re d - shirt s and they are ga ther ed in front of c ity ha ll , k w an g h w a m o on and so on their s el ve s .
If you are interest ed in Red de v il s , sea r ch it on you t u b e right now .
also , If you are in Red de v il s d ur ing the world c up per i o d s , you can feel K or e an ' s pass ion .
Let ' s enjoy the world c up ^ ^

In fact , it will come s to be de light after a while .
The more old er we become , the f e w people s c o l d other s with an open heart .
When I have no expect ation about a man , I will tell him nothing even though I have some comp la in t s about his work .
In most case s , the man s c o l d ed and the man s c o l d ing are sh ar ing the pai n s to a ch i e ve future go al .
D e c 8 th : It was co l d . . . .
S le e p ing U G L Y
To day , I over s l ept again when I take a n a p .
F or t un ate ly , to day ' s over s le e p ing was about three hour s , not more than 1 2 hour s like previous ly .
But it ' s not a good ten d en c y to sleep ing in day time .
If I find a job , there is no time to take a n a p .

I think I am f a c ing the care er ch o ic e now .
On one hand , it ' s not a go l d en time of the job mar ke t for a c he m is t .
On the other hand , is it w or th to in ve st a l ot of money to get a m aster de g re e in A c c o un ting ?
To be or not to be , it ' s always a question .
The se days , we le ar n hot is s u e about E a st S e a .

M an y people like it , though , for me it did n ' t at t r a c t me .
Even so , I want ed to see her smile so that going there did n ' t make me he s it ate .
D ur ing that time , we enjoy ed va ri ous at t r a ction s like a sp e c i al p ar ad e which take place at night .
A ccord ing to my girl f ri en d , she ' d re ally want ed to visit either of Tokyo D is ne y L and or Tokyo dis ne y S e a with a bo y f ri en d .
N e x t day , we head ed to As a ku s a , one of the p op ul ar sight se e ing sp ot s in Tokyo .
A l th ough it was morning , there were a l ot of people , es pe c i ally for e in visit or s .
A c t u ally , I did n ' t expect such the c r ow d so it took me long to go through the As a ku s a ro ad .
we b ough t some so u ve n i or s for our family and friend s and after w ar d s we went to Tokyo st ation to take a bu ll e t ra il with a l ot of stuff .
I ' m not f a m il i ar with the big c ity , Tokyo and I can dis c o ver more at t r a c t ive place s if ha i v ng a ch ance to tra ve l to the out st and ing c ity .
my ne m e is a y a .

This is a J a p an e se co m m on idea : `` S or M ? `` which mean s `` S e m er u or M a m or u ( off en d er or de f en d er ) `` or i g in at ed from `` S ad is t or M as o ch is t ``
My idea is if you are either a v ic t im always affect ed by ur ex ter n al en v ir on ment includ ing people or . . .
T h o se are en able d by in depend ent mind , there f or e I name d it `` le ad er `` .
I strong ly feel the ten d en c y is wide s p re ad ing es pe c i ally for you ng J a p an e se mind .
How easy to see people want to be c ate g or i z ed .
B a c k then , S a m ur a is who change d J a p an at the time of M e i j i R est or ation were ut ter ly different from to day ' s J a p an e se mind .
I went to `` R y u i ch i S k a m ot o ' s P i an o So l o To ur 2 0 0 9 `` at A p l il 2 .
The live he l d at A i ch i P re f e c t ur al A r t The at er .
I ar ri v ed there at 1 8 : 3 0 .
The live would start since 1 9 : 0 0 .
The perform ance was done for two and a half hour s .
I started L an g - 8 .
but I do n ' t know well about how to us e this .
I want to study e ng l ish .
and I want to be able to speak e ng l ish f l u ent ly .
to day , I have the t est for dr i v ing a c ar . . . .
I am worry ing about that .
I ' ll try to do my be st ! : )

I take the t est every month for ho b b y .
I know the t est ' s not well know n for n at ive English country because it ' s kind of simple for them .
I pro m is ed to myself that I write a story here one c a week at least .
The dr e a m was that I ro d e on a e le p h ant with an ex - girl f ri en d on a mo un tain .
Then the e le p h ant f l i ed the s k y .
The s k y was very co l or ful and I felt get ting co m f or t able .
When the e le p h ant s ud d en ly di v ed down , I w o ke up .
B y the way it is a picture of e le p h ant that I took in A ng k or W at about five year s a g o .
A ng k or W at is W or l d He ri t age S ite .
I was very impress ed to see many temple s and many re m a in s .
I ro d e on a e le p h ant and looked around some re m a in s .
M a y b e this im age made me such a strange dr e a m .
H i ! It ` s been for a while !
long time no see
But I know only a f e w p h r as es and that were not c or re c t .
I ` d a p p re c i at ed if you write about this .
It ` s been for a while .
And I ` ll write some sen t ence s that I want to p r a c t ic e .

I was look ing for bu s stop , so as to get ting to the be a ch .
I ` ll re g is ter my course s tomorrow morning , but it will be by no mean s what I want to do .
If you should turn in the paper on my desk on the time , you will get a better be ne f it .

I feel that he is very kind ness and a de d ic at ed teacher .
I have four class m e te s . One of them is a C h in e se .
My class is very live ly . I always have a f un .
I have been le ar n ing English for 3 year s at my school .

H o pe ful ly , some on e c or re c t my English .
And I can c or re c t some on e ' s J a p an e se writing .
If A b e or F u k ud a were on the to p , they would go f a in ted .
But many of the a u th or s of the re t re at this time still re m a in s there .
He re is the reason why job - hung ting in J a p an is ter ri b ly compli c at ed .
There f or e it can be a hu g e dis ad v ant e g e in job - hu n ting not to work ing at a comp an y right after gradua tion from un ive r s ity and to be `` K I S O T S U `` .
I was surprise d about L an g - 8 s c al e .

The name is B - 5 2 , a f a m ous c ock ta il in b ar .
The up p er la y er is co in t re a u , it should be co l or less , but I f a il ed in this la y er .
You c a n ' t write when you ' ll write something interest ing
It ' s a long time .
I could n ' t have written a j o ur n al in English re c ent ly .
Why ?
I ' d write something interest ing .
As it ' s the same in my n at ive to n gue , when you ' ll write something interest ing , your ten s ion will l if t too much , so you could write nothing .
- D re a m co la b or ation -
H a ve you ever thought that I would easily read b ook s in a co f f e e sh op ?
I also thought that many time s .
One day , my friend said , `` Why do n ' t you go to a star b u c k s co f f e e in R op po ng i ! ! ( is very far from the place where I live ) And of course , I thought it is c r a z y to go there ( because , you know , it co st s me a l ot of money and time , and there are many star b u c k s co f f e e )
`` Why ? `` I said .
He con t in u ed , `` This s ta b u c k s works co la b or ation with T s ut a y a ! !
We can read b ook s , dr in k ing a c up of co f f e e , before we bu y them ! ! ``
I los t for w ar d s and I was surprise d the idea of that .
Then , I of ten go there .
I think that co f f e e p ri ce it s el f is very ex p en s ive .
I think it is one of the in ve st ment s to me .
V an c o u ver S un R un
To day I part ic i p at ed in S un R un , which was 1 0 k m run even t .
U n t il I started , I was not sure if I could run comp le te ly .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t do run n ing da i ly .
I should have p r a c t ic ed for a f e w month s before the even t , but I am a pro c r a st in at or and I did n ' t do at all .
With o ut any re he ar s al , I tri ed 1 0 k m run to day .
However , when they saw a go al b an n er , they s ud d en ly d ash ed off and I was far left behind .
I did n ' t have any en er g y re m a in ed and I had pai n in my k ne es .
I wonder ed why they kept en er g y so much that they could d ash to go al at last minute s .
A n y way , to day was a very beautiful day and we enjoy ed beautiful view .
I heard a very n ic e new s yesterday !
K ha b ar o v s k is the large c ity in the Russian f ur e a st and it take s almost 2 or 3 hour s to get to there from Tokyo by us ing an a ir p la ne .
S e o ul is great for people who l o ve sh op p ing and have a l ot of money , but not good for the ch il d re n .
But I have three pro ble m s with going to K ha b ar o v s k !
The second is that it is very co l d in K ha b ar o v s k d ur ing the w in ter , so I have to bu y a very th ic k co at to keep myself w ar m .
I have to pro te c t myself from p ic k p ock e ting .
And some people say the police in K ha b ar o v s k are ir re s p on s i ble and dis t r ust , so I ' m w or ri ed about it , but I believe K ha b ar o v s k is a n ic e c ity !
F er r ar i I s a man u f a c ture r of s up er d e p or t ive c ar s with b a se in mar an e ll o .
bu il d ing c ar s of comp e t i tion s and la ter , in 1 947 , also began to make de p or t ive c ar s
I of ten he ar some on e saying `` English is need ed ! `` .
I do ' t think so .
The thing is that he / she has ability to do something .
And , if he / she could speak English , it will be a d v ant age .
English will be a d v ant age only when they can do anything sp e c i al .
How do you think about this ? ?
To day I f le w a k ite with my ch il d re n in ne i g h b or h o o d p ar k .
It was so w in d y that my k ite f le w ve ly high ly .
It ' s the only time in their life that they watch ed a k ite f ly ing .
They enjoy ed to f ly it .
A t begin n ing , there are me re ly 3 different c a f e f r an ch is es .
But now , f a st f o o d sh op s and con ve n i ent st or es p l un g e into this co f f e e w ar respect ive ly .
There are over ten th ous and con ve n i ent st or es here .
E ver y a hu n d r ed s te p s you can hi t 7 - 1 1 and every a hu n d r ed fifty s te p s you may bu m p into F a m i ly M ar t .
In other w or d s , you can bu y a c up off co f f e e every where here .
far m er s only make money under 3 do ll ar s a day .
N ever th e less , in S ar t b u c k s , the p ri ce of a c up of co f f e e is over 5 bu c k s on a ver age .
I re m e b er that my first sh op p ing ex pe ri ence in In ter ne t in 2 0 0 3 .
I b ough t a bo t t le of mo is ture g el from e - b a y .
But I still not get the good s now .
I was c he at ed and los ed the money .
T im e to the 2 0 0 7 , my second time , I b ough t s k in c ar e co s m etic s from T A O B A O .

A l th ough I was c he at ed s ever al time s , I still b ough t the pro d u c t from in ter ne t now .
I read many pass age s about how to dis ting u ish good sh op and bad sh op which im p ro ve my ability to dis ting u ish the pro d u c t .
This year I have b ough t many pro d u c t from in ter ne t .
they all have good qu al ity and l ow p ri ce .
This is a di ar y the f is t time !
I am not to think of to write something .
In the first game , I ra n back because it was de f en se , then I felt a p u ll in the c al f .
I was hung ry , very hung ry !
I had s c or ed some point s , and al th o u g my co ll e a gue s help ed me , I c a n ' t con t in u e play ing .
I want to ex pe ri ence the th ri ll of whether I make a great pro f it or great los s .
how and where can I make it come tru e .
F a c ing ch o ic es of the future , how many people could be clear ?
Then , they would be la b el led as a sha l ll ow and full of money in mind ed st ud ent .
How C ome ?
Some would just f i ll th i er pass ion s in language s , study ing different language s and ex p l or ing a different country , c ul ture s , history , c us in e , . . . . . .
Some would be play ing s a f e , they do not understand or they have not f i g ur ed it out at this ti n y moment s .
A t least , they may have b as ic know led g e in this str e a m .
M a y be .
I s it a pro ble m of only happen ing in H on g K on g students ?

The b or ing S um m er V a c ation , ,

The c l u b J i ha ad C he er s the A r a b ic de p ar t ment in my U n ive r s ity .
The c l u b J i ha ad have the perform ance s four time s in every year .
The me m b er s of the c l u b p r a c t ic es two hour s ever day .
It ' s quiet hard thing .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t enjoy the ex er c is e , but the reason that I was keep ing on this c l u b is the re l ation s h i p .
D ur ing this c l u b act i v it ies , I can make a great friend s h i p .
L u c k y or B ad day
To make 1 s amp le , it take s about 1 or 2 hour s .
And I got a water m el on by my P rofessor .
And I got 2 to m at o s by my a p p ar t ment ' s own er .
To day is l u c k y day or bad day ? ? ? ?
I can find that I should not have ex pe ri ment s any m or e , to day .
It ' s not look well .
When I sea r ch on the in ter ne t , it is i ll of le a f or the p ot is too small for it to gr ow .
When I am in my be d I heard the voice of some body .
He said that `` I can go to end of sp a ce .
There are The high c i v il i z ation p la ne t , l ow c i v il i z ation p la ne t and p la ne t has w ar .
T h o se living ent it ies are the same as a hu man being .

I asked him .
`` I want to look at them but how do I do for it ? ``
He said `` You have to as t r al pro j e ction but you have to come back to your body unti l s un ri se .
I am still in the sh ock of this un e x pe c ted thing .
This morning I brought my f in al re s ul t s and all the other do c u ment s to my a g en c y in or d er to get my for m al off er from un ive r s ity of s y d ne y .

I down l o ad ed ' e c l i p se ' from in ter ne t , yesterday night .
R o b er t ' s f al e s k in & T a y l o ar ' be l ly m us c le was f ant a st ic . . . .

R o b er t & K ri s ten are re al co up le . . . . .
they look good co up le . .
and they have a r um or that K ri s ten has a b a b y , , ,
may b e the mo v i e ' s pro m o tion str a g y .
any way , , , I impress ed the mo v i e . .
so I will bu y b ook that it s original v ir s o ion .
I expect a next mo v i e .
I gue s s it is different each country .
In K or e a , so many people come to w ed d ing ha ll
in or d er to con g r at ul ate them .
F ri en d s was be as s i g n a ro le by b ri d e g ro o m .
One guy in charge of m aster of ce re m on y ,

and f est i v al so ng , co un ter or so .
A fter ce re m on y , people have to be take n picture all to g e ther .
It is im p or t ant to t ally .
M ar ri ed co up le keep it me m o y all their life .
P e op le who came to w ed d ing ha ll take a good me al .
And once all of s te p is over , co up le go to the ho ne y m o on .
It ' s b ri e f s um m ar y of K or e an w ed d ing ce re m on y .
In the past de c ad e , it has been said that people should try to in c re a se op p or t un it ies of c he w ing things as much as possible .
M an y s ur ve y s have show n that people can me m or i z e things better while they are c he w ing things like g um than while people are n ' t do ing that .
A ccord ing to the new s , va ri ous s c i ent if ic gr ound s for the re le v ance between c he w ing things and bra in act i v ation have been dis c o ver ed .
However , upon try ing re m o v ing the t u b es from them and let ting them eat f o o d with difficult y , they became able to walk and talk .
My father is l o v ing person .
when he dr an k and was in a good mo o d ,
J a p an e se k im on o , house and the e ar th . ``
It is one of express ion s of his l o ve .
F or a co ll e g e or gradua te st ud ent , it ' s heard to live in a he al th y way .
I c a n ' t keep it last for more than a month .
What I can do is eat ing f r u it s and ve g e t able s every day for take enough v it a m in .
I went to the Tokyo D is ne y re s or t with a family .
T h ough there were very co l d , my d aught er s are very de light ed .
I will do my be st to write the di ar y .
R e c ent ly , I study English again .
B e c a us e I work with for e i g n people .
So , I de c id ed to study English every day !
M a y b e , new for e i g n people will come to our comp an y next month .
I want to talk with them in a po s it ive ! ! ! !
It is s an g by T VXQ , which is my favor ite ar t is t s .
There f or e , it is s an g in J a p an e se .
and I got to like it .
U n t il then I did n ' t know how beautiful so ng it was !
I think it has a p ow er to get ri d of my tired ness .
I asked my friend to return ma il s because she did n ' t return ma il es some time s .
I have n ' t up d ate my da ir y here for half a year .
It is because I was bu s y with my class es .
And limit ed by C G s k i ll s , we a d d some sh o ot s from other mo v ies for comp le te the story .
h m m m , It ' s a little con f us ed .
The ma in story is about a girl was going to s a c ri f ic e her s el f for know ing the coming of c at a st ro p he s .
M a ke a long story short , here is the v id e o .
P e op le usual ly think s mar d er is a b s o l ut e ly bad things .
And they get ha p p y when the some on e is k il led .
A l th ough , they got a ng ry when the some on e k il led people .
He was a kind of guy who did n ' t have friend s in re al life .
However , he even los t all of them for I do n ' t the reason s .
A n y way , he k il led people he had never even me t , ' c a us e he got tired to live .
( I do n ' t think it make s s an se , ' c a us e it c a n ' t be the reason to k i ll people .
A n y way , he said so and I do n ' t know any m or e . ) In his co ur t , many people , who se friend s or f a m il ies were k il led by him , ho p ed him to da ce de a th p en al ty .
He was ar re s s ed a f e w days a g o .
He is the man who w an n a k i ll a man .
I not ic e for my English s k i ll s is so fee ble .
I ' ve ever stay ed in other country to study English but it ' s still no good .
I might could im p ro ve only my English speak ing but my gra m m ar is ho ri ble .
So I want to as k every b ad y how do you study other co un t ri es language ?
I want to know which is the be st way to e ar n other co un t ri es language . . . . .
I know the name of it though I have n ' t st ud i ed serious ly .
In the class , we take the w or d `` l un ch `` as a ro ot for the mind m a p at first .
B as ic ally , mind m a p has one ro ot and some bra n ch w or d s re la ted to the ter m , then the de ta il s m ul t i p l ies just like bra n ch es of a tree .
It ' s a us e ful for me to bra in st or m and think about the things de e p ly .
I will study more and m aster it to bo c ome more so p h is te c at ed man .
I want to watch f e m al e ' s f i g ur e s k at ing but it is too l ate .
P ro b ably , I will work l ate at the office tomorrow too .
I re c or d ed a f i g ur e s k at ing pro g r a m .
F or ex amp le , s um m er f est i v al , be a ch , f i re w or k s so on .
I ' m look ing for w ar d everything .
D o you have p l an s on s um m er ?
B e c a us e it co st too much money , I have to work part - time job .
I r ent a d v d .
It ' s `` S e ve n `` .
I watch ed that last night .
The last scene I was impress ed with bra d p it t ' s perform ance of he at ed .
The ha t r ed and con f l ic t .
To m or r ow is the first day of R a m ad an ; which mean s that I must n ' t eat or dr in k anything all day long , from the da w n ti ll the s un se t , and this every day for a month .
A c t u ally , it ' s an am a z ing month , I le ar n a l ot from it , it make s me know how poor people feel when they are too hung ry but c a n ' t eat anything even not a little b re ad , al th ough it ' s very c he a p ! !
A l s o , it help s me to con t ro l myself : I have f o o d , I re ally want it , I need it and I ' m able to take it but I do n ' t , just because I must n ' t and nothing else .
So I wonder , if I can do that and other people too ; that mean s that g i v ing up s m o k ing or dr in k ing is n ' t im po s s i ble .
It be l on g s to the de p ar t ment of the me d i a de s i g n of H o k k a id o In st it ut e of T e ch no l o g y .
The f e a ture of the s ta m m er ing s ta m m er s without being str a in ed .
It s ta m m er s also in front of an in t im ate person .
The cha ir p er s on was done in the home ro o m every morning .
It did not worry about every on e .
A fter it had come home , I c ri ed b it ter ly .
I am too sleep y to mo ve sha pe ly s m o o th ly .
I got home , took b re a k f a st and read new s p a p er s .
So I was l ate for class .
I ' m an no y ed to whether I bu y a be d or not .
It ' s so long time to sleep in our life .

When I had a pro ble m with my ex bo y friend , I sen t an e m a il to him , because his n ation al or i g in was same as my ex - bo y friend .
He ga ve me many suggest ion s and I called him `` D ad d y `` after many e - ma il s .

He is a ment or of my life and off er ed me to s up p or t f in an c i ally , when I di c id ed to study in the N e ther l and s .
But I re f us ed it , because this was my dr e a m .
A fter this , he a d a p ted two girl s .

He is going to re t ir ed .
He said I and you ng people are see d s of ri ce .
He would like to in ve st to me and you ng people as a see d of future .
But for me , I am not sure I am see d or not .
Even I still do n ' t know what I will be or can be .
I just wish he us es his money for his ha p p i ness and can be ha p p y always .
B e c a us e I do n ' t know I can make him ha p p y .
In addition , I have not see n him after 1 5 minute s cha t in the train for se ve n year s a g o , but this is tru e story . . .

z or o is a great sword s man .
I want to go a b ro ad in s um m e e e e er b a c ation ! !
But I do n ' t know where is good for tra ver ing X3
F or ex amp le , in c a p it al is t ic so c i e ty , there are comp e t i tion s by comp an ies so s er v ic es can be better because people comp e te each other and qu al ity of s er v ic es get better .
S e c on d ly , comp ar e with co m m un is m , c a p it al is m is better because people comp e te each other so when they are success ful their salary in c re as es .
On the other hand , in c a p it al is t ic so c i e ty , s al ar ies are the same so people do not try hard because even thought if they try hard , their s al ar ies are the same .
The de m er it s of c a p it al is m would be if you l o o se the comp e t i tion , you may not get bo n us so the s y s te m is good for w in n er s , but may not be f re n d ly for l o o s er s .
So , in c a p it al is t ic so c i e ty , there is a need of s a f e ty ne t so even the l o o s er s can live ha p p i ly as well as w in n er s .
Some of the pro s of c a p it al is m are in c a p it al is t ic so c i e ty , comp e t i tion make s the s er v ic e and pro d u c t better and people try hard to get high er bo n us .
They are when they l o o se comp e t i tion s they may not get bo n us or salary so they might need s a f e ty ne t so they could at least get salary .
As I w ro te my previous ent ry , I got my be st s c or e on the last T O E I C ex a m .
S ur p ri s ing ly , I got 1 0 0 per c ent at one part of listen ing se ction .
To day is e le ction day in j a p an .
My co w or k er , who has been work ing to g e ther for five year s , is qu it ting the job .
I ho pe I w o n ' t ha ng over tomorrow .
I have n ' t st ud i ed English a c c ent so I still do n ' t speak English well .
I still do n ' t like to study English a c c ent .
When I was study ing English a c c ent I see m to stop it at once .
I do n ' t like that I put my to n gue on my te e th .
I heard that J a p an e se people ' s English is we ir d because of English a c c ent .
We do n ' t study a l ot of English a c c ent .
We almost study English is that write and read .
We do n ' t con ver s ation by us ing English .
My teacher said `` We re ally do n ' t need to speak English in J a p an .
It ' s need to live a b ro ad or you work in c amp an y which need to speak English . ``
R e c ent ly N e w s . = by S n ow . . . =
I ' m going to speak the new s on re c ent ly .
P e op le took s u f f er er s by s n ow and it was so hard .
B e c a us e of s n ow , M or e than 3 0 0 c ar s stop p ed on the ro ad .
and they ( on their c ar s ) s l ept that place on the one night .
No w , They re s c u ed by the G r ound S el f D if en se F or ce .
A t f in ally , the s n ow was 1 3 8 c m ( = ma x im a m ) on b it w e en 2 5 th and 2 6 th .
but , to tell you the tru th , I have n ' t see n s n ow in our re g ion in this year yet .
How do you think about it ?
I am bo ar ed . . .
S ame place to go , same people to me e t , same s ch ed ul e to do . .
What the w or se is the we a ther is not good to day . .
I mi s s my friend s , but it is hard to me e t them d u e to some reason s ; mar ri g e , mo v ing . .
R o o m
R e c ent ly I ' m interest ed in co or d in at ing the room .
but unti l now I do n ' t have consider ed co or d in at ing ,
and it ' s difficult to find b al ance because my room is ta ta m i .
D o my be st make n ic e room !
The re st a ur ant I like most
I like to eat at the re st a ur ant near N a g o y a st ation called `` O r ch id G ar d en `` the most .
It ' s a bu f f e t - style re st a ur ant , and serve s me al s b as ed on a certain them e which change s every month .
In addition to it s great me al s , it command s a n ic e view of train s .
There f or e , the re st a ur ant is p op ul ar not only for those who like to have de l ic i ous dis he s , but also for those who like to watch train s like small ch il d re n .
I can not stop !
When I am do ing pleasure things I could n ' t stop them .
When I am watch ing one mo v i e I want to watch it any m or e .
But if I watch it again I would mi s s my study time .
So I should stop it after watch ing a mo v i e .
It ' s bad when I was do ing the in ter ne t .
I ten d to do the in ter ne t unti l I want to sleep .
I should de c id e the time when I should stop the in ter ne t .
But I thought `` If I do n ' t say anything , my part n er c a n ' t tell me anything `` , so I said everything I just had thought with co ur e g e : )
L a st night I had gr il led me at for the dinner at the re st a ur ant with my family .
That re st a ur ant take s the style of v i k ing .
I like `` H A R A M I `` be st of all the part of be e f .
I ' ve take n y um m y `` H A R A M I `` eat i ly and also some f la v or s of ic e c re a m last .
I di c id ed to j o in a English con ver s ation school called `` R ar e J o b `` to day .

B e c a us e I c a n ' t a f f or d to write a j o ur n al ent ry at night to day , I will try to write a j o ur n al ent ry now .

But I think last year is co l d er than this year .

I heard that the la ke which is near the my house free z ed on w in ter before twenty year s a g o .
My mother man e g ed to even play s k at ing .
I was s up ri s ed that I heard this fact .
The la ke has not f ro z en at all for a twenty year s .
I re al i z ed then that the is s u e of en v ir on ment al is re ally serious .
R e c ent ly , I do n ' t listen to m us ic so much .
B e c a us e now I always listen to the E S L P o d c a st that can be down l o ad from the In ter ne t .
I listen to that in or d er to m aster listen ing English .
But I us ed to listen to m us ic before .

D id you know ?
I like listen ing m us ic , but now I de c id ed to listen to English only !
hi there
I was very me l an ch o ly yesterday .
B e c a us e I re m e m b er ed to high t school days .
I got a p h on e be st friend s from high t school .
They are p re c i ous friend s .
As I live far away from home town , I c a n ' t me e t their one or two time in year .
It is rather l on e ly .
But I ' m p l an n ing to return home town this sp r ing !
I ' m finish ed work to day !
I ' m very tired and I have a pai n in my l ow er back .
I ' m d y ing for show er , and I want to go to be d e ar ly to night .
P le a se c or re c t anything I w ro te .
I took English ex a m called G T E C to day .
The sub j e c t is listen ing and writing .
It was difficult for me .
I do n ' t think I will take a good s c or e .
When next ex a m , I want to take a better s c or e !
The last part time job has finish ed to day !
I have work ed only a f e w time s a month in three month , but there are so good people in place of work and it ' s so good : D
I a p p re c i ate meeting with people !
I will live in Tokyo as a new ha b it at , and I think it ' s a op p or t un ity to me e t with many people .
I took an English con ver s ation train ing on last F ri day and S at ur day at my comp an y ' s O s a k a head qu ar ter .
The train ing was perform ed comp le te ly only in English .
There were three different class es a ccord ing to English le ve l .
A l th ough I part ic i p at ed in the high est le ve l , I was surprise d that every on e was re ally able to speak English f l u ent ly .
A t first , we ga ve a present ation in terms of our work in or d er to le ar n how to do effect ive ly in English .
A G o o d present ation in English need s three part s : p re v i e w , body and re v i e w , that is as same as in J a p an e se , I think .
The part of p re v i e w includ es gr e e ting , ti t le , object ive and a g en d a .
My present ation did n ' t includ e even object ive and a g en d a because I ga ve a part of previous present ation I us ed at a meeting .
On second day , we had second ch ance to give our present ation .
That purpose of second present ation was to c he c k our present ation were act u ally im p ro v ed because of f is t day ' s le c ture .
The night of first day , I p re p ar ed my present ation hard and p r a c t ic ed what I would talk again and again .
O w ing to hard s el f - study , I man age d to give my present ation well .
A t second present ation , other four n at ive in st r u c t or s ga ther ed just in or d er to give question s and commen t s after our present ation .
The ir English was quite so easy that it was not so difficult for me to answer their question s .
As another less on , we le ar n ed how to pro ce ed business meeting in English by us ing a ro ll play .
We st ud i ed the im p or t ance of the way of think ing l o g ic ally in English , which was as same as in J a p an e se .
A l s o , the class perform ed to t ally in English .
That circumstance s gradua l ly change my think ing from J a p an e se to English .
I think `` a co up le of `` is an us u ful express ion when you speak English .
I ' m study ing English to p re p ar e for T O E F L t est ( J u ly 1 0 th ) , but I have no n at ive f i en d s so I ' m trouble in writing ta s k .
I p r a c t ic ed some writing es s a y for T O E F L t est , but I c a n ' t know whether the se es s a y are c or re c t or not .
So will you please help for me to ex a m in e my es s a y ?
The se are my es s a y
There are two reason s for this : the ha r m ful ga s and g l o b al w ar m ing .
M or e o ver ga s o line s which are f u el s of a ut o m o b il es is made from the f o s s i le f u el such as co al and o il and the pro ce s s of ma k ing it may also need s the f i re which c as u e C O 2 .
I think that this is the very serious pro ble m not only the e ar th but also our live s .
F or ex amp le , the high er the g l o b al te m p er ture is , the high er the sea le ve l will be and as a re s ul t , some il and s will s in k , of course people who live in the se il and s leave their country .
M or e o ver the g l o b al w ar m ing will do ha r m the a g ri c ul ture .
A ccord ing to the re c ent re se ar ch , the p ri ce of ve g e t able has been in c re as ing for s ever al year s and this is because the
te m p er ture has been in c re as ing .
If the g l o b al w ar m ing will last , our live s will be de st or o y ed some day and the se effect is ma in ly cause d of dr i v ing a ut o m o b il es .
One reason is that appear ance tell us a l ot of things about how he
or she is , and the other reason is that j ud g e ment b as ed on appear ance or the c l o th es is more re l i able than j ud g e ment b as ed on any other things .
A ccord ing to a re c ent re se a ch , we can get more than 8 0 % i nformation about other ' s character is t ic b as ed on the f i g ur e .
This mean s that when we make j u g e ment co un t on appear ance we can know how his or her character is t c
M or e o ver the c l o th es express person ' s id ent ity .
When you gra s p a l ot of ma g a z in es , you can find that people think the c l o th es as a way to express how they are .
There f or e the appear ance and the c l o th es give us a l ot of st able i nformation .
or the c l o th es is better than j ud g e ment b as ed on any other things is that the far m er is more re l i able than l at ter .
To begin with , when you believe what other ' s state ment you can not know which they tell a lie or not .
However , when you believe what they are or what c l o th es they we ar you can .
In addition , when you me e t other s for the first time , you are not be able to make j ud g e ment what their character is t ic are .
F or the se reason s , the j ud g e ment b as ed on appear ance or c l o th es is more re l i able .
To day is the second day of s k i in st r u c t or ex a m .
My first ex a m in er was C o l in who took charge for me .
I could almost catch the w or d that my ex a m in er said in our less on .
I he ar ed the new s on the ra d i o in the morning .
The se people must be he at st ro ke more than good s w e at p op le .
I have just little s w e at if it is very hot day like 34 de g re es .
I ' m going to p r a c t ic e s w e at ing well to do Y o g a .
A re you good s w e at ?
I started school at the age of six , but it is n ' t usual age of a first - for m er s .
U s u ally ch il d re n started school at the age of se ve n .
And my teacher told I read at the le ve l of a six th for m er .
But to day I want to tell you about what I am read ing now , and not in Russian , but in English ; )
As I said , one of my ho b b ies and also a pro f es s ion is se w ing .
P ic ture s in the b ook help me very much to understand it s te x t better .
It ' s very s im le to understand ing and full of o b v i ous case s .
I have n ' t open ed it about a month , because I have n ' t had enough time to .
If I ' ll be able to us e it easily , I w an n a make my own mo us e over English - English di ction ar y for F i re f o x .
Some of my friend s call me P re s id ent O b a m a because I look like him , but I do n ' t think so .
I like to play v id e o game s with X b o x 36 0 and listen i g to m us ic .
I l o ve an im al s , so I have a do g ( f e m al e ) called `` M il k `` I name d this name because she look s like co w , but she is not f at .
In the future , I am going to have p ar ro t because my favor ite an im al s are b ir d s ! !
Besides , my mother do n ' t like an im al s well , so I think that I want to live by myself .
This is my into ro d u ction .
most of the J a p an e se students consider that salary is not ne g le c ted .
So the be st ch o ic e of I m p or t ant thing is end up to sea r ch a job we re ally want to do .
As my re c on s id er ation , It was a difficult for me to con t ro l the pro g re s s of this class .
Besides I could n ' t come to conc l us ion because I could n ' t catch their opinion s a c c ur ate ly .
In any case it was a good time for me to b r us h up English .
A l th ough the G ot th ar d B a se T un n el in S w it z er l w i ll be the long er when it open s tra f f ic in 2 0 1 7 .
F a m ous b as ke t b a ll play er Ya o M ing is re t ir ing from N B A .
But if we get everything , we are ha p p y ?
We should think which we re ally need .
The simple life give s me pe a ce and quite .
As time went on , the sit u ation is get ting w or se , M a in character and his family es c a p ed from the mar t by c ar .
A fter long j o ur ne y , they found there was no ga s left in the c ar and s ur r ound ed by mo n s ter s .
The ma in character de c id ed to k i ll their family by himself with a ri f le and stand ta ll against the mo n s ter s .
A t that moment , he a v i ly ar m ed so l d i er s ar ri v ed and at ta c k ed the mo n s ter s with mi s s il es and mo p p ed up them success ful ly .
How was the feel ing of ma in character , if he wait ed a little more , then his family could go al ive .
This was the mo v i e I enjoy ed .
It was n ic e and w ar m we a ther to day .
I felt w ar m b re e z e when I was wait ing a train on a p l at f or m .
I close my eyes and tri ed to feel it as much as I could with my who le body .
P er ha p s , my te m p er depend s on the we a ther .
I feel please d when it ' s s un n y day , but I do n ' t when it ' s bad day .
I ha te g l o o m y day .
I feel like that I do n ' t want to do anything all day l o m g .
So open i g the w in d ow and c he c k the we a ther is first a ction I do when I w a ke up .
I wish tomorrow were fine we a ther .
It is ra in y in coming and going .
In the morning , I was ma k ing a f o o d and my ar m was b ur n t .
I put on my ar m in str e a m ing water .
I was near ly ter r b i le .
I want my English to be c or re c ted . please help me !
A friend of mi ne of ten as k me to help him with a c ad e m ic es s a y of e ng l ish , but I ' m not sure whether my English is c or re c t , so I heart i ly wish there were any on e who c or re c t my English .
I ' ll write the es s a y which my friend have to hand to teacher by 2 0 j u ly in a week , so I want you to c or re c t it .
We have va ri o u c ul ture , c ust o m and so ul , on our own .
Some time s people in for i g n country do n ' t understand it .
A f e w day a g o , I me t an A m er ic an girl .
T u i g er mean s T i g er W o o d s that is a go l f play er .
When S ant a C la us laugh at , he said `` ho ho ho ``
T i g er W o o d s has for te en girl f ri en d s .
ho mean s f an k y woman .
When I understand it , I could n ' t laugh at .
But when she said it to A m er ic an bo y , he laugh at .
M o b i le p h on e
One month a g o , I b ough t a mo b i le p h on e .

And I want to have many friend s .
He l p me , p le as le ar n English language .
I do n ' t like co l d .
But , when it f e ll s n ow , it make my mind ha i g h t .
No w I ' m living alone .
E s pe c i ally , I am we a k in c ook ing .
B e c a us e I make too much it .
In this case , I over e at myself .
They also said `` the ta p water do n ' t r u in your he al th im m ed i ate ly `` .
Then if I keep to dr in k the ta p water for a long time , it will in j ur e my he al th .
It is my first ent ry of this sit e .
I have no time and money to go to an e ng l ish school ,
I ' m look ing for w ar d to co m m un ic ate with many people .
Y ing T h an k s a l ot .
I can n ' t speak J a p an e se , so I c a n ' t help you .
It ' s so e m b ar r as s ing that my under w e ar is always we t . . .
I mean , there are in h er ent mean ing in every sp e c if ic fact or includ ing your dr e a m a ccord ing to K or e an s up er st i tion s .
If you go for a dr ive with your girl friend in your dr e a m and the ro ad you dr ive down is beautiful like full sp e ed high way , it mean s you will get me r ri ed with your girl friend soon .
If you see a beautiful ga r d en , or if you have a beautiful ga r d en in your house , it mean s l u c k y .
There is a funny but di r ty things includ ing your dr e a m .
H a ve you ever de f e c at ed in you dr e a m ?
In your dr e a m , if you saw it or you have it , it mean s that the pro ble m s you have , it will get so l v ed !
If you had a dr e a m about the di r ty things , I mean . . . . `` P o o `` , you should better bu y a l ot ter y ti c ke t !
It was strange ; I pai d it every month by us ing on line .
A l th ough I told them so by e m a il , they answered that they did not receiv e it .
But the me m b er of s ta f f might set the wrong account number of e le c t ri c fee in my b an k c ar d .
So I pai d it , the money went into the wrong account .
I explain ed the sit u ation and what I want to do at there for five minute s .
I ' m not visit or .
I re g is ter ed for `` face b ook `` re c ent ly .
My friend s t aught me how to us e it and soon I not ic ed that it is a be ne f ic i al we b s ite .
M or e o ver , all f un ction s which we can us e are free !
I want to us e `` face b ook `` effect ive ly , make for e i g n friend s , and im p ro ve my ability of English much better .
I ho pe my English s k i ll become better .
P re p ar ing for P re s ent ation

I pay 3 0 do ll ar s to an English teacher yesterday .
I took a English less on for about 3 hour s .
I le ar n ed a l ot of things which is im p or t ant to talk to a for e i g n er s .
It was f un to le ar n English when she t aught English to me .
She ga ve me some ti p so I can us e the sen t ence that she ga ve me .
I prefer to le ar n English at home but I not ic ed that some time I should le ar n English by an English teacher .
I am very week in e ng l ish language .
I can write e ng l ish almost well .
but when I try to speak , I do n ' t get any w or d s .
A r d ent l o ve was ex po s ur e between M as a m i n a g as a w a and A k ir a of E x i le ' s me m b er .
M as a m i n a g as a w a is J a p an e se act re s s .
A k ir a is one of the me m b er of E x i le which is J a p an e se p op m us ic gr o up e .
They are a ch il d f o o d friend s and A k ir a is four year s old er than M as a m i .

If you would like to know J a p an e se c ul ture , I think O k a m i will be a very good te x t b ook .
O f co ur e se , I have original J a p an e se ver s ion .
I st ud i ed the pro no un ce of `` s i `` and `` sh i `` on Y O U T U B E yesterday .
It ' s difficult for J a p an e se
because they only le ar n the pro no un ce of `` s i `` .
But it is interest ing than that .
So the English study ing c a n ' t stop .
everything is possible
ho pe to make f re n d s with you !
And I will help your C h in e se s k i ll s , too .
It was my th ir d time and quite in te t est ing . : ) And what I not ic ed in the class is that there are many A m er ic an s who ten d to dr ive a g re s s ive ly .
It ' s go n n a be re d ic ul ous ly ex p en s ive .
And I also not ic ed that it is f re a k ing trick y to care about the w or d s I us e is s ing ul ar or p l ur al in con ver s ation . . .
S or ry to say , I also do .
F or e i g n people of ten say , `` I ' m pro ud of you . `` I think they are so f ant a st ic w or d s , while we hard ly say it here in J a p an .
When I am prais ed by some on e , I feel so ha p p y and ga in en er g y .
Besides , I get to like him or her so much ! !
To day is a n ation al ho l i day - C ul ture D a y .

My g la s se s are b l and new and everything is sp ar k ling clear !
I at ta ch ed a p h ot o I took as I was sit ting my co u ch this after no on .
I took this without f l ash , because I need ed to c a p ture the b l u e ness ! !
I talk to my p ar ent s on S k y pe e v ry s un day night .

G r a pe s are pro no un c ed as `` P o d o `` in K or e an .

This year I read b ook s `` J ust ic e by S and el `` , `` The id ent ity of de f l ation `` and so on .
The se b ook s were so great , because the se mean pro f ound opinion .
But the b ook `` T h ing s that I should do at 2 0 ' s age `` mean s ur f a ce opinion .
again write
It ' s more than one year since I write last j o ur n al .
In this year I change d two job s , now I ' m work ing at a comp an y just a like I leave d one year before , I feel I have walk ed a c ir c le , it ' s too de se s p i or s . . .
English in st r a c t or m ur d er case
In J a p an re c ent ly to p c s is who you g man k il led e ng l ish teacher three year s a g o .
He went away some where , yet he was cha se the police .
K il led e ng l ish teacher was you ng g il r l from E ng l and .
That girl ' s family came from J a p an , they appeal ed k i ll er must was c aught .
I ho pe k i ll er must was c aught very very soon .
I think many J a p an e se is friend ly , kind ness .
But there is a bad man in all country .
So every on e who visit ed to j a p an will take care .
If you take care , you enjoy your s el f in j a p an .
We will we l c ome to your visit ing and help your tri p .
As you know , the other day a ma j or e ar th qu a ke at ta c k ed J a p an s ever ly , es pe c i ally k ant o are a and a l ot people there are f a c ing many difficult ies .
F or ex amp le , a c or d ing to the re p or t s , they s u f f er from f o o d short age and c a n ' t get enough sleep .
F or I live in k an se i are a , my family and I are all right natural ly .
He re in k an s a i are a , we le ad the same life as before .
I get up in the morning after I got enough sleep , and have a b re a k f a st .
And after usual b re a k f a st , my father go to the office and work for his family as usual .
To be honest , the e ar th qu a ke have little D I R E C T in f l u ence on our da i ly live s . ( O f course , it has much in d er e c t in f l u ence s on us .
This is show n by the fact that I ' m very very worry about people in k ant o , part ly be c a se many of my f ri ed s live there . )
To tell the tru th , when I watch de v a st at ing scene on T V , I c a n ' t still be l ive such a c at a st ro p he re ally happen ed in J a p an .
A n y way , I ho pe the sit u ation will be all right and people can get back their smile s on their face s as soon as possible .
But I ' m s u f f er ing a kind of set b a k .
A l th ough I can read something in English to some ex t ent , for ex amp le a new s paper such as C N N , B B C , The N e w Y or k T im es and so on , I c a n ' t speak English well . . . ( In fact , I ' m also poor at writing in English .
But I ' m poor er at speak ing . )
I think one of the reason s why I c a n ' t speak English is I do n ' t have many op po t un it ies to talk with no n - j a p an e se people in English .
But at the same time , I also think I man age to b r us h up my speak ing ability to some ex t ent by read ing b ook s or listen i g to many ma ter i al s in English .
So now a day s I ' m re d ing a l ot of new s p a p er s and b ook s and watch ing v id e o s or mo v ies in English and think ing how can I get a ch ance to express in English .
O f course , one of the way s is here L an g - 8 !
And in addition , if I can get a ch ance to talk with no n - j a p an e se in English , it could n ' t be better ! ! !
But the pro ble m is how can I ga t the ch ance .
Then I came a cross an idea that S k y pe is one of the way s .
P u b l ic bath
P u b l ic bath is well know n by J a p an e se .
F or for e i g n er s , it is not so p op ul ar , is n ' t it ?
( A re there public bath other co un t ri es ?
I ' ve see n it only T ur ke y .
It call s `` H a m a m `` . )
You ng people do n ' t us e public bath of ten , I think .
But you ng w ome n were only our s .
A fter tak ing bath ,
We went to `` I z a k a y a `` to have a be er .
How de l ic i ous it was . . . !
( How do you say `` I z a k a y a `` in English . . . ?
I re ally l o ve F ri day .
I live in to k y o .
My b ir th day is no ve m b ar 2 3 th .
I ` m a st ud ent at un ive r s ity .
And I study de s i g n .
My ho b b y is listen i g to m us ic and play ing b as s g u it ar .
I j o in ed r ock m us ic c l u b in sen i or high school .
And my favor ite ho b b y is draw ing picture s .
I made not e b ook s of picture in j un i or high school .
But I will work part - time job .
I like a fine day .
My ho b b y is a c y c ling .
I was sat is f i ed with it , but it was too ex p en s ive to me , about 1 0 0 0 0 yen !
I went to T a m a ri ver to see f i re w or k s to day .
I could n ' t see f i re w or k s last year because I c aught the f l u .
So , I ' m ha p p y to be able to see f i re w or k s this s um m er !
In fact , I f e ll I am lack ing co m m on sen se for anything .
F or ex amp le , I k n w o the w or d `` L e h man sh ock `` , but I do n ' t under st n ad how it effect ed to W or l d e c on o m y and c a n ' t explain about it well .
No w I am n ' t a st ud ent any long er , so I think I need to have know le g e about the se things .
There f or e , I b or r ow ed a b ook called `` To the people who became work ing pe o le without understand ing e c on o m y `` written by A k ir a I ke g a m i at l i b r ar y .
I ho pe it he l s me get more know led g e to understand e c on o m y .
I ex a c t l ly dis like read ing b ook s , but I try to do it little by little .
O f course , I have to study sub j e c t con ne c ted with comp an y life like honor if ic w or d s , so I need to have more time to study !
I watch A m er ic an come d y dr a m a .
I watch it when I have free time , for ex amp le a f er work , ho l i day s .
F ri en d s is very funny , so my feel ing c al m down when I watch it .
