And he took in my favor ite sub j e c t like so c c er .
A c t u ally , who let me know about L an g - 8 was him .
H is Ka n j i ' s ability is much better than me .
We ' ve know n each other for only half a year , but his less on was a l ot of f un .
I heard a sen t ence last night when I watch ed T V .
When you go down h i ll , you have to st ic k out your ch est or you will f e ll down .
When you go up h i ll , you h v a e to be n d your back .
It is like when you are con f ro n ted with f r ust r ation , you have to keep your con f id ence .
When you are go s m o o th ly , you have to be more mo d est .
When I was at school , we pai n ted a l ot of w o o d en hand ic r a f t s like small p l ate s and case s .
The ma k ing so u ve n ir is a hard and interest ing work .
Well , f in ally , my mother took me to the c ust o m s w in d ow , she ga ve a pass p or t to man . . .
That ' s two b a ll s : one with a c at inside , other with do g .
You know , you can take them at s l ot machi ne .
The th ir d me m or y is the house we live d .
It was sit u at ed near He l s in k i , big and light house with the small la ke behind it ( it was w in ter , so it was f ro z en ) .
D o n ' t know why .
I like d the w in ter F in l and .
And I ho pe I like the s um m er F in l and .
J ust im p ro v is e already ! `` To tell the tru th , I myself did n ' t expect what I C A N play like that I did .
If only I had black de n se c ur tain s .
A co up le of week s a g o , I heard a new W h it ne y H ous t on ' s t un e on my c ar ra d i o .
I had been wonder ing what she was do ing .
It said that was dis a p po in ting .
O l d and not beautiful . . . . .
I know her t um ul t u ous mar ri age with B o b b y B r ow n and an ar d u ous b at t le with dr u g a d d i ction .
S t i ll she has n ' t re c o ver ed from them ?
M or e dis a p po in ting thing to me is she said the reason of her bad voice was because she talk ed with O p r a h W in f re y too much on her show .
That might be one of the reason s , however , it sound s like just an ex c us e .
I would say after 1 0 year s of wait ing , it has not f a il ed it s ti t le , at least from my first impress ion .
A n y way , I think I ' ll sp ent quite some play ing it in the next f e w week s .
O K , let ' s all for my first ent ry .
B e f or e , I went to a l i b r ar y .
On the way I had a head a ch e .
So , I think if we have to go some where on f o ot , we must put our ha t .
If we did n ' t that and walk for long time , we will co ll a p se or di e .
If my sen t ence s are n ' t p r a c t ical c or re c t them .
This morning I found out that one of my f a v o ur ite b and re le as ed his new al b um .
I already for g ot about R is e A g a in st an it is a great surprise for me , because I did n ' t return to them for 2 year s .
I ho pe this b and did n ' t become w or se yet like many other s big one s and I ' ll enjoy listen ing it .
Well , there re m a in s to get it and c he c k it out .
It ' s because my m um is probab ly the be st c ook I have me t in my life .
C ook ing is not her pro f es s ion , she is a house w if e .
I have at e at hotel s and ex p en s ive me al s but they are nothing like what she c ook s .
I rather be work ing outside than be a house w if e .
I think it ' s about for one and half year .
I should have ex p l o d ed who le this bu il d ing so that I can make them de st ro y ~ ! ! !
I had to write about co un se ling .
This is my first time to write di ar y on the in ter ne t .
I ho pe some on e see my di ar y and c or re c t it .
I watch ed D V D `` G re y ' s an at o m y `` to day .
A c t u ally I keep watch ing it the se days .
So there are a l ot to see .
I do n ' t know me d ical w or d in English very much .
But I can study English through this .
And I think it ' s f un , right ?
And I ' m eat ing a b an an a every day for my he al th .
The b an an a is ga ther in my st o m a ch and give s me en er g y .
I have to make a new s p a p er in English as my s um m er va c ation home w or k and I de c id ed to in t ro d u ce about my do g on the new s paper .
I will in t ro d u ce about my do g , T i ar a .
She is c he er ful and p l um p pretty do g , per ha p s she is the c ut est do g in the world .
She ' s a go l d en re t ri ever and she ' s 8 year s old .
He r f ur is beautiful am b er and so f t .
She is little st up id , but has per c ept ive in s i g h t s about f o o d because she is always f a m ish ed ^ ^ She l o ve s f o o d !
When she is b as k ing she look s very co m f or t able .
however , I ho p ed ra in because it is too hot .
I saw a new s on Ya h o o yesterday .
It re p or ted that C h i en - M ing W an g c ut his ha ir and had a new ha ir style .
He re is the l in k .
It talk ed about there is a big di f f er ence about different va l u es of a hand s ome man between We s ter n co un t ri es and E aster n co un t ri es .
It me n tion ed many ex amp le s of J a p an e se me n , K or e an me n and H on g K on g me n .
They pai d much at te m tion to their face s and also sp ent l ot s of money to sh op .
But in We s ter n co un t ri es , the stand ar d of a hand s ome man depend s not on their face s , but on their ma s c u line s y m b o l s , say , m us c le and be ha v i or .
I started to not ic e the way s of for e i g n c l o th ing and ha ir style s the se past days by watch ing T V pro g r a m s , such as F ri en d s , S r c u b s and e t c .
If they had a long ha ir , it will be re ally long and th ic k .
B y con t r a st , me n in e aster n co un t ri es most dress up .
E x c ept a shirt and a j e an , we usual ly we ar an access or y .
As to ha ir , me n usual ly have a me d i an ha ir , neither very short or long .
If we want to c ut a very short ha ir , we must leave some ha ir on the back of ne c k in or d er to a v o id look ing like a n er d .
It almost co st a who le morning .
I have to watch the N B A f in al game 3 .
I like you give me any co m m e t s and op in o in s too .
I re ally like to dis c us s .
My so n have di ar r he a
When I came back home from work ing to day .
It was like a w ar ter and so n ' s hi p became re d .
To m or r ow I will go to home t ow n .
We are read y to go out .
But we c ance i that .
But a no way .
I am listen ing to m us ic with the co m m ut er train .
To day , I listen the m us ic , it look s like in the c a f e .
I like w ar m sea s on .
so I like sp r ing .
S p r ing is very ex c it ing sea s on .
J a p an e se school , work start s sp r ing .

S in ce to day , I ' m going to try write a di ar y ! !
To day is nothing sp e c al to write ! !
It ' s kind of T a i - w an stay le ma s s age .
I l o v ed the ma s s age sh op where I went because the s ta f f of the sh op explain s what is wrong in my body .
A fter that , I went to a f it t ness c l u b which has be d r ock bath ing .
I feel re la x to take a be d r ock bath ^ ^
I ' m went to S en d a i to business tri p to day .
The sp e c i al pro d u c t in S en d a i is a co w to n gue .
I b ough t it and at e at home .
I want to eat it s co w to n gue again .
The d aught er was w o k en up by my w if e .
The w if e was w o k en up by my s ter t or .
Where to do it and when we should leave is not de c id ed yet !
So , even now I feel n er v ous , wonder ing if It ' re ally going to be he l d .
And I want to live my life on my own p a ce .
B e c a us e when I finish ed my class es , home w or k s or job s e t c . . .
It ' s near ly 1 0 p m when I back home .
It ' s near l ly 1 2 p m .
The se days I s u f f er ed many un ha p p y things .
M a y b e those matter s were not so bad as the fact s , but I re ally could ' t hand le them while they o c c ur ed to g e ther . . . .
I do n ' t know how to m aster this language well . . .
T h ough I sp en d most of my time and en er g y in le ar n ing English , it see m s that I hard ly make any im p ro ve ment has become a tru th . . .
I do n ' t know why I have to le ar n English so hard . . ! ! !
our teacher said a sen t ence to me , which made me heart b ro k en . .
I had never knew my English was poor unti l the teacher told me that my English was sound i ll o g ic ally . . . .
S um m er ho l i day
I had long b re a k time .
I should to study again .
I ' m got up at thirty past 6 a m in J a p an .
He ll o ! N ic e to me e t you ! My name is A il s a .
I ho pe you make many friend s of the la ng - 8 .
than k you every on e !
E le ction will be done A u g st 3 0 .
M a y er is c he er ing H a m ad a mi n is ter of de f ence .
H a m ad a b ir on g to L i b er al D e m o c r at ic P ar ty .
This time they may be los t a d o m in is t r ation .
D e m o c r at ic P ar ty has more many s up p or ter s than them .
M a y er is bu s y with e le ction c amp a i g n and his own work .
I ' m going to do every ting for help him as his se c re ta ry .
I went to Ka n a z a w a un ive r s ity f est i v al with my A m er ic an friend .
I made good friend with V i e t n ame se .
we enjoy ed well .
And we had a dinner with my another friend s .
It ' s a am a z ing day to day .
It is made of sp ng e : ) It is c ut e .
I ' ve receiv ed the accept ance letter and s ch o l ar s h i p de c is ion from the B er k le e C o ll e g e of M us ic .
I ' ll ent er the B er k le e in the f a ll se m est er this year .
But I have two w or ri es .
One of them is that my English is very c l um s y yet .
A no ther is high - p ri c ed t u i tion .
A n y way , I ' m study ing English at the T O E F L In st it ut e the se days .
The B er k le e do n ' t require s a T O E F L s c or e .
M an y as s i g n ment s are give n to me every day .
It ' s very difficult to do all of them , but I always try to make ma x im um effort s .
I ' m la er n ing English , but it ' s re ally difficult for me !
S ever al days a g o , I got an ir re g ul ar heart b e at for the first time in my life !
It was like this ; I s ud d en ly started to feel a kind of dis c o m f or t around my heart .
I was very s c ar y because I had been very he al th y so far .
I ' m still in the 2 0 ' s .
D o I have to get along with it all my life ? ``
The do c t or told me that I did have a ir re g ul ar p ul se o s s a c ion ally but it was not a f at al one .
He a d d ed that it could get w or se d u e to str es s and f at i gue , and he just a d v is ed me to take an enough re st .
I was re le a v ed to he ar the do c t or ' s di a g no s is but I ' m still w or ri ed .
I think that may be a co m m on question for those students want to p ur s u e a high er education .
What C h in e se un ive r s it ies off er for their students are most ly comp o s ed by course w or k b a se c ur ri c ul um .
I ' ve s um up some point s which I think im p or t ant and us e ful .
You can co un t on go o g le as your be st friend , a d v is er and an almost in f in ite re s o ur ce s of a c ad e m ic paper s .
M an y of them you can down l o ad p d f copy , or If you c a n ' t down l o ad paper from the l in k s s ch o l ar . go o g le . co m off er you , go direct ly to the a u th or ' s we b s ite , many a u th or s enjoy their paper to be seemed and cited by p ot ent i al read er s .
A good re v i e w is the be st start point .
And then you can tra ce the a u th or , or the paper cited to do a more in de p th re se ar ch in your interest ed are a .
The b al ance of w id th and de p th of your read ing is es s ent i al .
B o th way have it s me ri t s and dis ad v ant age s .
I no v at ive and original idea is good , but if you can not find them , you should know that most of re se ar ch work is just re f in e ment of other ' s work .
I ' ll sp en d the next week s on board of the `` J ust o S i er r a `` ve s s el ma k ing some g e op h y s ical re se ar ch and le ar n ing .
B ad thing , I have n ' t le ar n ed the ve s s el ' s part s in English yet .
The thing that I want to make in J an u ar y 2 0 0 9 is to in ve st more effort in study ing English and keep on writing sen t ence s in English every day here , L an g - 8 !
However there were not so many people there , so we do not need to wait our turn outside .
I think that M an g a is the great ent er tain ment c ul ture from J a p an .
My favor ite write r s are N a o k i U r as a w a ( The M on s ter , 2 0 st c ent ur y bo y and more ) and H i ro y a O ku ( G ant z ) .
B y the way , I found some we b sit es that there are hu g e am o un t of M an g as that tra n s la ted in English .
( I think no do u b t about il le g al . )
It ' s a new ex pe ri ence and very education al of English .
But , I think that there are a l ot of difficult express ion s in M an g as in English .
D i a g no s ed of being easily impress ed
I re al i z ed that I ' m that kind of people who are easily impress ed .
I ' m mo v ed by very simple things and other people might not even have a second look at .
F or in st ance , I started watch ing In d i an mo v ies about a month a g o .
When I had the time , I brought about six In d i an mo v ies to watch .
The first mo v i e I watch ed , made me c ry for two hour s like a five year old who los t her do ll .
A c t u ally all the In d i an mo v ies have the same b as ic idea .
However , I con t in u ed c ry ing d ur ing the re st five and each one of them impress ed me even more .
In d i an mo v ies are like c la y that you can sha pe into many different sha pe s but they ' re all still made of c la y .
This conc ept might be a b it am b i g u ous for those who have n ' t been in such sit u ation .
I took a me d ic in e , so I feel better for now .
`` 4 5 0 th time s ``
This is my 4 5 0 th time s di ar y .
I started keep ing a di ar y around the 2 0 0 8 .
T h an k s to the people all over the world , I ' m having a f un time and so l id time .
C ha ng ing the sub j e c t , I got my call from my friend yesterday .
I re c ent ly out of sha pe . `` I was somewhat p u z z i ed for an answer .
He ll o ! My name is K en .
I ' m study of English was started .
However , it is ter ri ble and difficult .
The no ve l is about a im p or t ant ro man po l it ic an called C a i us M ar i us .
He is de ma in character , al th ough appear ing other s like C or n el i us S il la , M e t el us , and the C a es ar ' s gr and f a ther .
M ar i us did n ' t come from a im p or t ant family , but he became in con s ul because he was a c l ever and p op ul ar g en er al at ro man ar m y .
So , after he was ch o se con s ul by the ro man s , he went to A f ri k a where he f ough t again t Y u g ur ta who was k ing of N um id i a .
M ar i us w on the w ar in two year s , and when he went back to R ome he was ch o se con s ul again d ur ing five year s .
M ar i us had to f ri g h t other tri b es at no r th of I ta ly , unti l in 1 0 0 B .
he must leave the p ow er because he got sick .
I l o ve study .
B y the way , D o you like study ?
I ' ve just receiv ed a in ter n ation al call by my ce ll p h on e .
I was wonder ing if that was from my friend ' s call .
But that ' s from K or e a ' s qu ar ant in e de po t ,
We do n ' t have this s y m p t o m s now .
If that help s , this picture is the i nformation what ga ve us from J a p an ' s qu ar ant in e de po t when we return ed J a p an .
is every on e free ?
let s ha ng out with me in to k y o ~ ha ha ~ x D
im so o free ti ll next month .
c a z I don have a school unti l it ! !
I don like it .
A l th ough most people think about what ha p p i ness is like , most people never do u b t there are ha p p i ness some where in hu man ' s life .
A f a m ous man , I heard , said in the past that the w or st things for you is to be b or n in the world .
This is my n ic k n ame .
I st ud i ed a p p l i ed p h y s ic s and electronic s at a un ive r s ity in Tokyo .
I took a b a ch el or ' s de g re e of the se sub j e c t s at the un ive r s ity .
I change d job s a f e w time s but the same ty pe of job as an e ng in e er .
I still work for an electronic s make r in J a p an as an e ng in e er .
My p ar ent s and a brother and a s is ter live in Tokyo .
F u ku o k a is l o c at ed the no r ther n part of K y us h u .
K y us he is a part of the J a p an e se A r ch i pe la g o .
C o m p ar ing with Tokyo , F u ku o k a is comp a c t but it is a very co m f or t able c ity .
C o m m o d ity p ri ce s here are l ow er than those in Tokyo and F u ku o k a A ir p or t is very near c ent r al F u ku o k a .
You know , N ar it a A ir p or t is far from c ent r al Tokyo .
M or e o ver Tokyo is a very c r ow d ed c ity .
One thing I un s at is f y to live here is that I ' m se p ar at ed from my family .
It take s much money to go see my p ar ent s from here .
English less on for H a ll ow e en
I ' m an e le ment ar y school teacher as you might know .
In J a p an , start ing next year we ' ll off ic i ally have to tea ch English to students who are in both 5 th gra d e and 6 th gra d e .
I ' ve made some English class es , act u ally .
The less on ' s to p ic was H a ll ow e en .
We provide d some kind s act i v it ies to get the students not only to keep enjoy ing the less on but also to keep some v o c a b ul ar y in mind before they know it .
One of them is `` H a ll ow e en tri v i as and B ing o `` .
The st ud ent need to answer some question s about H a ll ow e en I ' ve p re p ar ed by play ing B ing o .
The more c or re c t ly they answer , the more B ing o they can get .
A fter the class , I asked the students to answer a question n a i re .
I was very glad to find they like d the less on .
One of my ul t im ate go al as an English teacher is that all students look the world b ro ad ly .
I ' m sure you ' ll have p l ent y of op p or t un it ies not only to co m m un ic ate people from other co un t ri es but also to know s ever al c ul t ur al di f f er ence s through the less on .
I believe this will le ad them to accept ing more things .
That ' s why I ' m very ex cited with teaching st ud en s English ! !
It is c l o ud y or ra in y re c ent ly .
A l th ough my school was no le c ture , I got up e ar ly in the morning to day .
It co st six do ll ar s to was h ing and co st six do ll ar s to the dr y er .
When I was h ing end ed , it was even ing .
I went to the c a ke sh op in the c ity my friend in t ro d u c ed to me as n ic e ta s te and f a m ous .
The sh op of in n er de c or at ing was gr e en .
A fter came back home , I c ook ed dinner , and the dinner was p r a w n & a v o c ad o s al ad , ro a st ch ic k en and O T A M A S A N G O H A N .
F ir st , c ut let t u ce , c ut co ar se ly a to m at o and then s ta ir - f ly some p r a w n s .
The O T A M A S A N G O H A N is J a p an e se on ly tra d i tion al f o o d .
It only sp r in k le s the ra w e g g and a p in ch of the so y so ur ce on w ar m ri ce .
They were easy c ook ing but they ta st ed n ic e ! !
A fter that I watch ed two mo v i e , an im ation of g en i us bo y and 0 0 7 , on T V for a p p ro x im ate ly four hour .
I a p p re c i ate to tea ch English to my d aught er .
I was look ing for English class around here .
We thought just tak ing a tri al less on , but she told me that I want to go to the less on again .
I am very surprise d to her pro g re s s .
No w she is very interest ed in speak ing English , writing al p ha b e t s and s ing s W H A T ' S Y O U R N A M E ?
He r pro g re s s ow e to you .
It will be b a se after she will go to new school .
If I did n ' t need to take care of my kid s , I want ed to have your less on s !
It is very easy to come with kid s because it is c le an , s a f e , just a 1 - hour time di f f er ence and a v a il able H an ed a a ir p or t .
A fter class es of un ive r s ity , I went back home direct ly , p re p ar ed pack age s and sea r ch ed what time I should leave home and which train s I should take .
And if the tea m w in 8 game s , the tea m will get first position .
But re m a in d er of it s game s is 9 game s .
There f or e it is so difficult for it to get first position .
The start ing p i th i er was not good , so that the op po s i tion could get 3 point s easily .
We c he er ed very hard , but the mi r a c le was never happen ed .
T h o se are play ing sp or t s , read ing a b ook , l i th en ing to m us ic , tak ing a walk and so on .
My favor it ho b b y is talk ing with my friend s , because I think it is the be st time to be with my friend s .
I ga in ed about 1 0 k il o g r a m s after I qu it ted my c l u b s in high school .
That ' s why I have to los e my we i g h t ! ! !
So , I j o g and ex er c is e always .

She is teacher for walk ing and po s ture .
We had small talk ( short talk ? ) there , and left .
When I started to walk , I thought I want to talk with her more !
So I shout ed her name and stop p ed her .
We ex change our con ta c t in f o and de c id ed to me e t again very soon .
We me t two week s a g o , I felt strange , because we did n ' t me e t each other for many year s , but we have many things to tell each other .
P l ent y of things to talk , but not enough time .
We should n ' t so r t people into le ve l , but I believe we are living in same le ve l ( same c ate g or y , same world ) .
I do n ' t like watch ing a close s c re en so I k il led time read ing something .
To day , I read `` The catch er in the ry e `` as a s um m er home w or k .
To say the tru th , I could not understand why this b ook is thought a m aster p i e ce .
B e c a us e I did n ' t feel b or ed when I was read ing it , but I was not so ex cited or mo v ed .
If you had read the b ook , please tell me which part you think interest ing .

But who want s to go there , he must pass the ex a m and the in ter v i e w .
G o ing a b ro ad is my dr e a m , so I re ally c he ri ch this op p or t un ity .
It is a good ch ance to str e ng th en my know led g e , board en my ho ri z on , and enjoy the for e i g n c ust o m s , and also re al i z e my dr e a m .
With o ut any mean s , what I can do now is to im p ro ve my poor English , speak ing more , listen ing more and read ing more and so on .
In my opinion , it is a difficult pro ce s s to over c ome myself , but I must insist on and keep on ma k ing it , what ever how difficult it is .
On ce you make up your mind , so per s ever e in do ing it .
I was s up ri s ed when I found it . I have been study English for 2 y e ar s . B e c a us e I want to make a l ot of friend s all over the world .

A fter left S e o ul , I did n ' t us e the on - line st or es .

My e le ve n month s old so n could stand by himself for the first time to day !
He started to c ry hard after that , though .
He might be s c ar y that he was stand ing without any help .
My e ng l ish is very be d .
I ' m to know nothing about gra m m ar , and I ' m afraid to speak e ng l ish .
In fact , I want to say much something , but write e ng l ish very tired .

Why I still up l ate , because I watch ed l ad ies so c c er game ! The game was J a p an called `` N ad es h i k o J a p an `` v s A m er ic a .

Yes , it is my bo s s ' s one .
I than k my e ar for my s ur v i v al unti l now .
So many M M A fight er s thought I want to be more strong er than I thought .
This is the most ne ce s s ity thing for them but my opinion is de f f r ent from them .
Even if they are strong but they some time s co un l d n ' t w in .
B e c a us e M M A is sp or t s but they should n ' t think M M A is sp or t s .
There are a fight er s who do n ' t think M M A is not sp or t s and if they see m s to los e the fight s they are going to try to k i ll their comp e t it or and so that some time s the strong los t by the we a k .
I want to say is no future in just only the strong .
F ed or who is Russian , I think he is the one of them .
He is called the one of the be st fight er in the world .

very simple things . .
I felt very tired .
It ' s very l o ve ly .

I c ar ry it any where , and show it to my friend s .
I de c id ed that I man age it as care ful ly not to b re a k .
Some time s , When I get back from co ll e g e , I feel that I can do a b s o l ut e ly nothing but watch ing a mo v i e .
I feel so ex ha ust ed but I can not sleep because If I s l ept then when I w a ke up , I ' ll have to start study ing again or going to co ll e g e .

I am going to mo ve out to S a it a m a ( Ka n t o are a ) from here just because I study at the un ive r s ity in S a it a m a .
I ' m very worry about the ra d i ation .
We do n ' t know when the sit u ation re c o ver per f e c t ly .
The w or st thing in the world is sit ting in a room with only your p en and watch the time go away
P re y for me : D : D
R e ad ing B ook s in a bath
My p re c i ous time is the time when I read b ook s tak ing a bath !
I usual ly take a bath more than half an hour .
I think know ing other s ' l o ve affair does n ' t make any sen se for me .
I like the st or ies which can not be expect ed and be like a ro ll er
I thought e ar th qu a ke is coming when I was h my face in the morning .
I ' m so n er v ous at e ar th qu a ke .
I made an e m er g en c y b a g in case .
And I have to f i x my f ur n i ture s to stop s l i p p ing .

I want to do many things for one day .
On the other hand , I think I sp en d too many hour s to us e a comp ut er .
It is f un indeed , but it is was te time for me .
If I quite c he c k ing sit es so many of ten , I think I can s a ve my time more .
I need to re c on s id er about how to us e a time .
T h ough I ' m not good at us ing a time at all , I want to try to be good at us ing a time .
I must make a good s ch ed ul e which I never give up on it way to .
I want to have more strong mind to keep my s ch ed ul e , and I want to con t ro l a time , not time con t ro l me .
H i every on e it ' s been a while since I w ro te the last di ar y here .
On F ri day I was S c re a m and on S at ur day I was a b l on d ha ir girl .

He ex p l an ed the reason in S w a h il i , so I was n ' t able to understand , but I re al i z ed that they were in under the punishment .
D o you re m e m b er my j o ur n al which I w ro te 2 days a g o ?
To day ' s c al s s is the same class which I was n ' t able to tea ch them because of C H O T A M A J I .
T an z an i an students are di f f er from K or e an students .
When I was in K or e a , if we s k i p p ed the c al s s because of other affair s , they seemed very ha p p y .
However , in here , my students do n ' t want to s k i p the c al s s .
When ever I have a class at night ( act u ally , some time s we have an ex t r a class at night like to day ) , I was sat is f i ed of my students who listen ed de v o ur ing every w or d .
So I have to d u g my first M P 3 ( 1 G B ) out from my draw er .
Well , it can not sat is f i ed me .
And I f a ll in l o ve with the l i b er ar y in our school ! ! !

B y the way , listen to m us ic there is also a good ch o ic e ~ ( ha , ha )
D o you take a n a p ?
I us ed to lie down on the so f a after finish ing it .
R e c ent ly I read a b ook about the di g es tion .
A c or d ing to this , tak ing a n a p is not good for di g es tion .
It re c ome n d s us that even if we are sleep y after l un ch , we should not sleep ,
and if we get very sleep y , we should go for a walk to for g e t our sleep ness .
F in ally I de c id ed to p r a c t ic e it .
A fter l un ch of to day , I brought the b ook to the so f a and began to read it .
But two hour s la ter I found I had been sleep ing unti l that time .
I went to sleep after all to day too .
I wonder I will be able to stay up tomorrow .
My s is ter took entrance ex a m s a f e w days a g o , and she ' s wait ing her re s ul t s .
My brother will take it in this F ri day .
My s is ter is un ive r s ity , my brother is high school .
F ir st , I can see some mo ve ment s of people s to re c o ver from the da m age now .
When the e ar th qu a ke had happen ed , the e c on o m ic act i v ity was de p re s s ed strong ly .
We thought that it was not good to have a sat is f i ed days when people in the da m age d are a were s u f f er ed .
A l th ough that , we have already re al i z ed that the s ta g n ant e c on o m y was more bad for the re c o ver y of To h o ku are a .
F or in st ance , the us age s of the are a con ta m in at ed by the n u c le ar en er g y are now dis c us s ed on J a p an e se new s p a p er s f re qu ent ly .
I ho pe J a p an will re c o ver from this sit u ation and re p ly other co un t ri es for their help s in the future .
J p an e se en er g y po l ic y
B y the great big e ar th qu a ke in M ar ch 1 1 , J a p an e se en er g y po l ic y has change d dr a st ic ally .
M an y people claim that `` we should not us e n u c le ar p ow er p l ant ! !
`` It ' s tru e that ra d i ation po ll ut e people or ve g e t able s , so il , a ir and sea more or less .
However , I do n ' t think that n u c le ar p ow er p l ant should stop im m ed i ate ly .
B e c a us e if we c a n ' t us e e le c t ri c ity full y , e le c t ri c ity fee will in c re a se and some c or p or ation de c id e their fact or y to mo ve for e i g n country .
Then , J a p an e se e m p l o y ment will face great big difficult y .
M o st of J a p an e se people c a n ' t speak English .
So if we los e our e m p l o y er , we c a n ' t have job !
A fter that , we change our e le c t ri c ity s ous e to natural one .
We do n ' t have to change our en er g y po l ic y if we c a n ' t do that s a f e ly .
This is the thing which of ten J a p an e se w ive s say `` W h i ch is im p or t ant I ' am or your work ! `` .
It ' s same question .
Y e t she always answer wrong at the same question s that I had t aught s ever al time s , like ne g at ive number m ul t i p ly by ne g at ive number is po s it ive number .
She just c as u ally answered the question s and so r t of appeared im p at i ent , which made me so r t of a ng ry .
Y e t I has re f le c ted on myself of my be ha v i or back home .
I heard that before but I ' ve never play ed it and every one over there neither .
A fter having a be er po ng , many people play ed with it but a funny thing happen ed on that day .
T w o guy s were comp le ting against each other for run n ing in an a th l etic game .
B o th of them does not know how to run in the game ex a c t ly .
One of the guy tri es to run by l if ting up his k ne es a l ot and the other s are not .
A c t u ally , it require s l if ting up their k ne es high er enough to make K in e c t sen s er to sen se their mo ve , so he was c or re c t and keep the f a st est sp e ed in the ra ce .
However , the pro ble m is he is a b it too serious so he started mo v ing to w ar d the T V mo n it or little by little , then f in ally he s l i p p ed on a floor and f e ll down .
As the re s ul t , s ud d en ly he became 7 th in the ra ce which is the second from last .
So , the ra ce turn s out re ally funny one since one guy f e ll down and the other guy run s his s l ow p a ce .
It re s ul ted in get ting 7 th and 8 th .
E ver y on e started laugh ing and I was feel ing like a do c u ment ar y of a ra ce with a guy who did n ' t give up even though he f e ll down in a middle of the ra ce and a guy who keep s run n ing s l ow ly but never give up .
B e care ful d ur ing run n ing even though it ' s a game .
^ ^ It see m s nothing , but very re al ha p p i ness to me .
A t the same time , I want to get how to say no g ent ly because I want to have much ha p p i er moment than sleep ing in the morning !
I ' m their old er s is ter .
I do n ' t know what g if t s p re p ar ed my p ar ent s .
In the even ing we will n a ve a little part y with b ar b e qu e .
And of course there will be some our friend s with their kid s .
