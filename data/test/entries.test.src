A family , seemingly a father , a mother and two of their children , get on a car .
A funky music starts , singing some worst obscenities .
It seems they do n't care so much about its lyrics and rode on the rhythm .
This commercial film is really reflecting what happens to English learners .
Characters of the seasons are compreat different each other in Japan .
In spring , we can see not only plum and cherry - blossom , but a trailing mist across some mountain which is a crowning beauty in morning .
In summer , if you go to country side , many fireflies will welcome to you .
It must be fantastic scene .
In autumn , especialy late autmn , when you look at many reeds flushing golden and the leaves turning red or yellow , you must feel as happy as if you were dreaming .
In winter , silent snow indicate great intelligence which man can not have .
In the responds to the question as to which season do I like , it must be the time of seasonal change .
I miss passing season with affection , while I admire coming season .
Japanese value evenescence .
The beauty of the cherry - blossom is not so much the appearance , but evenescence .
The life of firefly is very short .
I wanna learning Japanese but I 'm so busy and I ca n't type Japanese on dis PC in the weeks .
I like here , so is Kichan
It tasty wad very good ! !
It takes two hours to commute to work each way .
I use a subway to go to work and change trains two times .

Today I needed to go to post office to pick up a letter from Japan .
I used a highway to just go to post office .
I think my Japanese friends would never believed this .

But I could n't see the game .

I decided to read aloud with AFN book .
A first section was the inaugural address of Barack Obama as the nation 's 44th president .
Usually I take I - pod to hear some music and English programs .
Today I found a new things about English .
The sentence is `` I can not thank you enough ``
I have felt this sentence sounds that person do n't appreciate .
Yea I learned today one thing today .
I give the fish which was his special favorite to his grave .
I can think of nothing , because of I am tired now , or just pretending to be tired now .
What I am doing now looks like nothing but coming from nowhere , or just it is that I have to think more to find out what is needed .
I have trouble with study , livelihood and my girl friend ( maybe leave soon )
I went to cafe near my school to read books and I walked for a long time .
Honestly I have to challenge German writing .

There are a lot of student from various countries .
Englansd , Italy , Austria , Slovakia , Serbia etc .
Since this was the first time for me to see Slovakia und Serbia people ,
Almost all conversation was in English , but I would have to say I had much difficulty to communicate with them .
My communication skill in English is not enough , and particularly for listening .
Addition to it , everybody has different accents in English including me .
So they tried to memorize it associating with `` Hiroshima ( Japanese city ) ``
It sounds funny , I never hit upon such a idea .
But I think Hiroshi is easiar than Hiroshima , because it 's shorter , is n't it ?

When I happend to walk by in front of kimono shop , a cute young clerk wearing kimono talked to me with smiling .
Some pretty girls wearing kimono were in Kyoto or Universal Studio Japan of Osaka on the pictures .
We talked about kimonos or something for a long time .
The clerk said , `` If you had a time , why do n't you try this on ? ``
Of corse I tried .
Because I had an enough time and I do n't have any kimonos instead of yukata .
The kimono which I tried was really beautiful .
I satisfied with trying it on and had fun with talking with the clerk .
But Kimono is very expensive , I do n't afford to buy it now .
It seems that today will be really nice day .
In the sky are n't any clouds , the sun is shining and no wind .
Also there are 3 degrees by Celsius , but it only11 a . m . Today I 'm going to play basketball in the skatepark .
By the way in the NBA Oklahoma City Thunders wins versus L .

It is as if spring had come already here in Chubu area , in the center of Japan .
This is a quick digression , and the headquarter of hot TOYOTA is here .
And yeasterday was my pay day , so I drew some money at ATM .
But it took no less than 100 yen to withdraw as it is on saturday .
you see , just to withdraw !
The banks are so budet - minded , why should I pay money to withdraw my money ?
What do you think ?
Though I make fuss over it , I take out on weekends .
By the way , I walked to the convience store on foot since it 's so near .
I could see many spring flowers out there , and I was able to feel spring actually is around the corner .
I looked up other words to mean warm and found as snug as a bug in a rug .
I found it very interesting .
My name is phyten !
I am a student in Hitotsubashi University whose department is ecomics .
My hobby is . . .
Guitar , reading books ( especially business and finance ) , badminton , the Internet , programming , and talking my friends !
Also we can play with our neighbors , so not only we can make a friends but also we can spend a time greatly .
Maybe I guess there is a saying , `` There will be fortunes to people who do nicely to their neighbors . `` .
If we share the foods to our neighbors when they are becoming poor , then we can get a foods to them when they become okay and I became poor .
Next , we should get a manner .
Neighbors are the part of our life and society , and all of the people like the neighbors who are very nicely .
And if we should be friendly , helpful , and getting a manner if we want to become a nice neighbor .
I finish my work now .
I fixed a program code .
On this line ' Ninja ' trains - nija 's face painted on - run every day .
But the train I 'm taking is not ' Ninja ' train .
It 's didnt means I get lost but lost my bank card .
Recently , I Was always absent - minded for any reason .
Keep thinking something no matter walking on the road or siting in the train .
After I find out the card was not in the right place .
I pour out the bag and check 3 times with anxious .
But still ca n't find it .
Then , I call my family immediately to let them have the lose report for the bank .
I can not do this any more .
But what I can do ?
I 've just got home , recently I got back home late because of the job .
I really want to say thank you for every one who correct my mistakes and give me a message .
I am now being an exchang student in American , and this is the first time I live without my family , so my parents worried a lot when I said good - buy to them at the airport .
But I reassured them by saying that I would send email .
My first glance at my roommate actually left a very good impression on me because she was 5 years older than me , which made me feel she would support me in so many ways .
When I arrived my room , she was just with her Japanese boyfriend , so she introduced him to me and told me that if I had any Japanese questions , I could just tumble them out to her boyfriends .
I felt that I was so lucky that God gave mesuch a nice roommate because she seemed to be very protective .
For a girl who left home first time , it really helped a lot ! !
At least , she gave a a sense of secure though her boyfriend always stayed in our room even at the bed time .
To let my roommate know that I would bot be a threat to her relationship , I always brought up my questions only when she was also in .
Therefore , she hoped that I could turn to other Japanese .
As a result , I wrote a note to her , apologize and made it clear tthat I did not mean to do that .
If she felf hurt , I would stop doing it right away ! !
Even though her boyfrined told me that he felt his girlfriend was too emotional and that I could still consult him questions when she was away , I declined his kindness and almost never spoke to him .
Originally I thought that everything will just go back to normal , to the very beginning when I was in a good term with her .
However I was totally wrong because now she only gave my a cold shoulder .
Last time , I fuzzed everytime as speaking more than usual .
Sounds irony , doesn ; t it ?
What I mean is the more I study about expressions or vocabularies , the more I 'm confused , because everytime I try to use new things , it does n't come to my mind as automatically as I wish , and it makes me mummuring ( ? ) .
So I have a school trip from 7th to 9th on september .
Although I live in Fukushima in Japan , I 'll go to Tokyo in Japan .
So I need to be ready for school trip soon .
So , I 'll write about school trip when I back home .
This lead to nowhere .
I want to try myself in the material world .
Our turn is 14 : 25 .
I 'm going to my university , and starting chor practice from now on .
I live in the dorm with international student from the U .
She is very good at Japanese and always help me study English .
However , because of her good Japanese skill , I sometimes hesitate to speak English .
Moreover , she always speak Japanese instead of using English , so I do n't have enough chance to speak English .
Therefore , I try to decide `` ONLY ENGLISH DAY `` and I ask her to speak only English during the day !
Come back in time , if I could : (
Annzu had been a stray cat and pecked by crows in a park , before a volunteer saved her life .
When she came to my house for the first time , she was so skinny that we could n't hug strongly .
Today , I bigin lang - 8
I study English since I was junior high school student .
I can read wrriten paper in Emglish , for example news papers .
But I ca n't listen and write in English .
The class composes of for student and teacher .
I have to speak words many times , so it is profitable .
Gossip Girl is a propular America TV series that was introduced to China as fashion and life style book .
In the shows , Serana and Blair are the most luck girl who is rich and beatiful , charm and so on .
They possess all the thing which was most girl want to have in the world over all .
The people in the Upper east live in gorgious and lavish , but they are elite who know how to manage a multinational corporation even though maybe inherited from family .
Obviously , they are spotlight in any parties at Newyork night .
we are mortal , directly I envy that kind of bule blood people .
Let me cite a fashional word `` hold `` which is fatacy of a amazing girl in China .
I want to NY someday .
One of serious problems in Japan .
I watched TV news which is about high numbers of suicide during yonger age from about 20 to 30 years old people .
The news told that the numbers continue to increase over 10 years .
Exactlly I think that most yonger people in Japan have no dream or purspose to the future .
Then they feel themselves as useless in the world , no reason to live anymore .
Anyway , present time , we are much richer materially than past but our minds got weaken .
And Japanese society is in aging society and we run out of work force of yonger people .
Somehow we must stop younger people suicide or our society will collapse very sooner than we expected .
I had been to Oita , my home town , for about three weeks for summer vacation , and I came back home three days before .
I felt afresh appreciation of my parents this time because of going back my home town .
I also realized how I had ever been having luxurious life .
I did n't feeling lonely before I went back to Oita , but still if I go back once , I will be accustomed to my original life that has any dogs , sister and parents , so when I was alone , I felt lonely very much .
But in fact , I 'm understanding it is too bad for me because I 'll go abroad in America for four years as a university studdent .
Nobody in my friends live my house nearby , so whenever I go shopping , I am alone .
It is only a matter of time to start my class , so I 'm looking forward to seeing my friends now .
It happend a few months ago .
That day , I was wating for a train at platform as ususal .
The woman , she seemed to be over 50 years - old , came near
where I was stand because there was public phone near me .
She put money into phone then dialled .
`` Oh , I 'm sorry I 'll be late `` the woman talked with big voice that
she continued talking .
`` I was pooing .
it was really big one so it took a long time to flash . ``
so I missed a train .
I 'm sorry I was here on time but it could n't be flashed ``
She desperately explained not her fault but her poo 's fault .
Sometimes people make an excuse for their mistakes such as tardy .
However , I have never heard such an childish excuse .
Othrewise , anybody belive her .
Everyday , going to the company , I watched the video on the iPod touch .
Recently It is `` the sesami street ``
It is for studying English .
`` Sesami street `` is fun for me .
But it Excitement story tired me sometimes .
The word Excitement means `` Hi - tensyon ``
Maybe it is wrong English .
`` sesami street `` is useful for studying english .
that `` less excitement `` english studying video .
I had a dream that I drove a car and a car fell off from the road .

Japanese government warned people that there was possibility of electric power failure in Kanto region yesterday afternoon .
Tokyo power company had already stopped their service in the scheduled area .
But they said power still was not enough .
And I filled plastic bottles , pots and bukect with water as much as possible .
We could n't use water , if we had power failure .
My apartment serves water to each family with electric power .
Fortunately , we avoided the crisis , though all ATM did n't work temporarily in one of Major Japanese Bank .

My cellphone has n't been working well .
I thought my cellphone at last broke down seriously because even when I pressed the buttons , it did n't react at all .
On being in the situation , I was almost losing my composure .
No sooner than had I noticed that than I went to my friend 's room whose cellphone is the same type as mine .
He was studying , but I broke in because I did n't afford to care for him .
He gave me some pieces of information about the cellphone and suggested that I call the customer center of the company .
Finished his story , I tried to call soon .
The moment I called to the customer center , I noticed that I was using my cellphone and it was working as usual .
I think it is because of my aging .
Every time I 'm writing an essay , I used a lot of the same transitional words .
If you know a lot of varieties of transitional words such as moreover , in addition , thus , therefore , in short , etc , could you please let me know ?

I am live in Saint Petersburg near metro station `` Ploshad Mygestva `` .
This station are not situated in center of the city , but I very often go to center for walkin on beautiful streets .
Many Peterburg 's streets save some especial historical form .
Little courtyards , narrow streets buildings from 19 century surrounded you and can movie you in this fantastic time .
And a lot of cars , shops and coffe houses ca n't break this illusion .
You may walk in this city many days and every day you will open some new details of this atmosphere for youself .
Many times I just walk on `` Nevsky prospect `` and go to the Aleksander Nevsky square .
Sometimes when I do not hurry I am just turn on right or left in random crossroads and aimlessly walk on little streets feel this unique atmosphere .
If you ever will in Saint Petersburg and you will have many time , I advise you just walk on the city one or two hours without any excursions and you will feel this unique atmosphere of 19 centure .

Those are serious .
In Hong Kong , the government focus on the drugs problem .
Also , Many social workers are concerning about the family and violence problems .
However , it is in lack of taking care of young people sexual behaviour .
But why is this issue in recent years will be even more serious ?
The researchers note that `` If women exposed to abuse , domestic violence , and family strife has enduring .
Also there are many cases which teenagers give up their babies in the street or abortion .
The most important thing , they do not think they are wrong .
She write diary and post her pregnant photos on the Internet .
She was proud of her pregnant .
We have three kinds of solution to solve teenage pregnancy problem .
The second one is non - government and social workers and the last one is consulting with other countries policies .
Firstly , government should support more in sex education .
Also teenagers feel embarrassed to communicate with their teachers and parents .
And their peer group affect them .
For example , peer group may give the wrong messages of sex to them .
Teenagers may misunderstand of sex which get the wrong information from peer group .
They have curious about sex and try .
After the sex education , it reduces the rate of teenage pregnancy .
Teachers can take care of teenagers which teaching them safe sex .
Also it can lessen their curious and let them learn the the correct values .
Moreover , mass media give unsuitable messages to young people , for example , Mother at 14 ( television drama ) , My Guardian Characters ( children 's comic book ) and Juno ( Film ) those are negative message .
They may think teenage pregnancy is universal phenomenon and western culture or it does not a problem and not special .
Also it is a trend to follow .
So , Hong Kong government should set up the law such as supervise the mass media .

I often listen to J - wave in my car , a Honda Fit .
Personalities in the radio programme are very friendly and gentle , which means we may easily listen to the programmes without any offense , but sometimes I do n't like their goody two shoes attitudes .
At first , I noticed familiar face when I was going to buy underwears at UNIQULO that the largest apparel company in Japan but I did n't have confidence that He was my old friend .
Because I have never met him since junior high school graduation .
I did not write dairies for almost a week because I was lazy . ( I am not going to say BUSY ) My previous English tutor told me that never use BUSY as the excuse to postpone something , because no matter how much busy you are , millions people will be busier than you such as presidents , CEOs , Famous and a lot of people .
I went to the Chinese medicine hospital last Thu , helped my Japanese friend to find a sweet room on Fri , set up the internet and went to a darts bar with him on Sat , played the beach vollyball and fooled around with some new friends at a beautiful beach in the north Taiwan on Sunday .
How do I become better English speaker ?
That 's just a matter of keeping practicing .
Today , I got a dayoff and went to see the circus with my family .
The circus havs run every this season in this area
from when I was a child .
I have never seen a live because I could have seen it on TV
Actually , a live circus was interesting ,
My daughter 's pleasure was the best for me on this show .
But if someone ask me to go again , I wo n't go even I pay .
Recently I was a bit lazy . . .
decent : His father wanted him to get decent education , so his family moved from his country .
innocent : He tried to prove his innocence , but no one did n't believe what he said .
sesitive : She said her skin is sensitive to every stimuli so she does n't wanna go on a hike .
serious : I thought she was joking , but when I looked at her face , it was quite serious so I realized she was saying the truth .
noble : I think every person need something noble in their life .
brave : My friend said I 'm brave , but I could n't find any brave character in me .
I wonder if the usage of `` serious `` above is correct .
Thank you for always writing comment .
I 'm happy and it is studied .
I think that it is difficult to always think as for the English .
Because I want to go for studying abroad someday , I do my best .
It is nice , becouse it is studied and the word is learned .
I enjoy spending life every day .
I started learning english recentry .
English is very difficult to me , but I enjoy to learn that .
tow diary in one day .
I always wrote diary towice in one day .

well , sometimes I foget to write in korean .
hehe - _ - ;
In the spring break , I went to bed around 3 a .
m and sleeped till 1 p . m .
The new semester will start from next week and some class will begin at 11 a . m .
It 's a shame to let them just pass for lazy sleeping .
So I wake up at 8 a .
It 's not easy for me to wake up ealry and sometimes I feel an irrestitible urge to sleep in daytime , but still I manage to get out of bed at least 8 a .
I have an appointment to meet my boss in the new workplace tomorrow a bit late night .
I will fight myself to keep me awake tomorrow ! !
That included electronic dictionary that I borrowed from her long time ago .
I had forgotten to return but she suddenly called me and asked to return .
So I found in my desk and she sent it with some souvenir .
I called my mom and let her know it was sent from my wife this morning .
After I finished my work , I met a friend who is member of same English circle .
She has a lot of DVDs which was counted over 200 !
I introduced the Lang - 8 to her .
I said it was good for study .
Then we went for drink a little and had a good time to talk .
She said she wanted to begin studying English radio program .
So we will study the same program and check what we learn every week .
No sooner did I come back home by bicycle than did the rain fall .
Yesterday I bought a great deal of ripen tomatoes .
I should or , actually , I have to study hard this week - end , but you know , there 's always some stuff that catch my attention more than studying .
What is Happiness ? Part 2
While I was listening to her story , I was looking at my dinner that already became cold .
Both we were n't eating .
She sometimes showed me her tears and sighed .
Actually I had no idea to encourage her , so I decided to become a good listener .
However , I listened to her story silently .
All I could do was to grip her hands .
To tell you to the truth , I really wanted to hug her , but I could n't because I did n't want to surprise her .
Hugging is n't a part of Japanese culture .
That 's life .
It becomes cheaper compared with before .
Though the origin of golf is unclear , it seems that shepherds knocked stones into rabbit holes is an established theory .
If it has been remaining , the cost is nothing , right ?
Anyway , I want to see Tiger play golf greatly .
It is hard rain today .
In Japan , a lot of typhoon come in September .
I am worried about the way home .
Probably the train will stop .
My interpreter 's class was so tough for me at last lesson .
The theme was `` About social participation in Japan . ``
One of my classmate presented that Japanese nation is straggling and facing low economical also political .
For the past twenty years , Especially middle - aged men has much abilities and powerfull .
They could controled all over the Japan .
However they do n't have enough abilities and display now .
So we need get second wind .
In the future more people who are women , non - residence and youth would be participate in any social movements .
It 'll be better than now .
That theme was felt abstract for me .
I thought she should have present more detail concrete .
We are , naturally , always looking for the best method , the fastest way , the easiest patch to mastering English , Japanese , Spanish , whateverish . . .
On the other hand , good methods [ Assimil ? ] when wrongly used can produce poor results .
In the end , what you should know , what you should [ at least you should . . . ] notice by yourself is that there is n't A METHOD for language learning .
Each student have to find his own method , his own way of learning .
Of course this is n't an easy thing to do .
I know some things work and some do n't , but to find out exactly how do it is n't that easy .
All methods have good and bad points , so what you have to do is notice the good points and use it in your way .
Of course I 'm being a bit stagy , but I just want to show that there is n't one method that rules over all others .
If you work - hard on it , you probably will not only find out what learning methods and strategies suit you better , but you also will start to notice some universal principles about language learning .
The average language learner , who usually follows just one methods ( like many English teacher here in Brazil who have learned English using the same method for more than 20 years ) , will probably not learn these principles and , therefore , become kind of limited when it comes to how to learn a language .
We had a very good time playing chasing game in the water .
I 'm very happy to see tat my daughter started to have more confident in the water because she could n't put her face in the water before she goes to swimming lessons .
She was even scare of getting a bit of splash on her face when she had a shower .
Now she can head - stand in the water !
As her school will have a swimming lesson starting soon , hopefully she has no problem in the water and can enjoy swimming with others .
I can tell the chlorine in the pool was very strong since even though a bit of splash of the water hurts my eyes quite a bit .
In addition to that , I felt really tired after getting out of the water although I had n't swim much .
It has been already December .
Did you enjoy every day ?
You go , and there is not the loss .

I want to know English words , and I look words up with dictionary .
I do n't know many English words and grammars and idioms and culture and blur blur , , , , , I had no choice but to study English every day .

But I 'm Japanese , so My thinking things are in Japanese x ( I want to think things in English .

I made a goof yesterday .
And , I also stopped by a superemarket near my house to buy something to get a bite .
When I went back home , I left things I bought at the drug store over there and forgot about it !
I found it 2 hrs later , so I rushed to the supermarket and asked the cashier where it is .
Fortunately , He kept them , and I could find them .
Please explan the following setences .
Probably right before she lost it .
How do you fit into this whole thing ?

I talked about study abroad with professor .
I ate out with friend .
A short time ago , my friend changed to a cockroach .
I 'll write about the story at my bathroom .
I washed oneself with my body sponge , like a panda as the everyday .
Then , something did happened .
Suddenly `` the fellow `` was passing me so quickly !
It 's a cockroach ! `` I shouted , and pointed shower at it .
After a few minutes , I took back my calm mind .
It wo n't move .
It was body sponge 's leg ( panda 's ) .
I somehow laugh .
I decided to operate it ( decided to weave its leg . )
After all , it got back its ordinary figure safely .
Now , it watch me from the desk .
What a fearful story this was ! !
It is difficult for me to speak and write with English .
And let 's tell own language each other ! !
My thinking was brought to a standstill .
I have no idea for that .
So , it is nothing and nothing again .
Where does my inspiration go ?
I traved with my class 3 days ago .
Although we were tired but everybody felt pleased .
We took many photo , about 700 pictures .
we went to a island , it name is Thung Nai , this is a new tourist spot .
People who live there is friendly , has fresh air , has many fruit trees .
After this journey I understand my friends and love them so much .
I think they feel its , too .
Today 's Yokohama was rainy day thought I had fulfilled my plan in my previous journal .
Heavy feeling of my body was vanished by to exercise indoor climbing .
Instead , my palm skin like peel and I can hardly move my tired body .
But I 'll be into good night 's sleep .
So I 'll must fight feeling that is not go to my office .
I guess I 'll be assaulted to muscle ache in the morning tomorrow .
I 've read The Scheme Team that is 5th book of Chestnut Hill Series .
Chestnut Hill Sreies are written by Lauren Brooke .
They are 7th grader students of a borading school for girls called Chestnut Hill .
The school has good horse riding programs as well as educational 's .
They face some dificulties .
But each case , they help each other to overcome those .
In this series , the relationship with horses is n't so main topic of the story , comparing with Heartland Series .
Still the devotion to horses of heroines is imporant .
The interviewers ask us [ 18 interviewees including me ] to come up with an idea of a new product and the marketing strategy to make it outstanding .
I was really surprised but not nervous because I takes International Business Management at the university .
There had been 2 interviews before I got the internship program .
Moreover , the new employees who had just come to work only 2 weeks told me to finish his work of 19 page translation within 2 weeks .
And to compose 17 English vocabulary poems for SAT course .
I was and still be infuriated with the way they treat internship student .

My son is
Second day since I registered this cite
What a great cite !
Anyway , I have a one - year - boy .
He ca n't talk at all now , but he always says `` Oh ! `` .
Whenever he finds something ( dog , light , button , etc . . . ) , he says `` Oh ! `` .
He discovers something every day like a inventer .
I woke up few munites ago .

It was hold the sea of my hometown .
The fireworks was set off ten thousand .

Have you ever watched the movie `` THIS IS IT `` ?
In Japan , the movie got a No . 1 on a weekly movie chart .
A lot of my friends have watched `` THIS IS IT `` and all of them has been enthusiastic to Micheal Jackson .
I 've been also a fanatic to Michael Jackson since I was teenager , but I ca n't go to watch the movie because I have to take care of my two young children with my wife . . .
BTW , I can dance choreographs of Micheal Jackson 's promotion videos , such as `` Thriller `` and `` Billie Jean `` , `` Smooth Criminal `` .
I will teach a choreograph of `` Thriller to my friends , who belongs to a dance club member .
I made GM which appears in Japanese animation `` Mobile Suit Gundam . `` I like this robot .
It is also fun to paint differently from original version .
Yesterday , I submitted graduate thesis .
I thought that submitting was equal to the certification of my graduation since my thesis was already checked by my professor .
But in fact , I understood that in March I have to take oral examination about my thesis .
I 'm a little disappointed with this fact .
I had planed how I spend my holiday . . .
The days I have to study will have continue . .
JP is too nervous to survive !
and let them go abroad one year or so ! !
I sympathize with the way of thinking ,

Each doctors spoke about `` knee problems `` .
The content of the speech was interest to me .
Especially , I was interested the speech of `` movement of anlysis `` .
maybe I will catch a cold : (
I think that maybe I will catch a cold .
Usually I 'm the one who always complain about the air - conditioner in my office .
I always feel hot and I always shout hot and hot to my colleagues , but now I have to turn off the air - conditioner .
I sit near the window so it 's the hottest place in the room but now although the sky is full of sunshine and all the heat is coming through the window do n't make me feel warmer .
I have to take some medicines first before the real cold catch me ( ^ _ _ ^ )

who can help me or tell me what could I do ?
My anxious
He had smoked with his friends secretly .
His class teacher came to my house .
He told me what had happened until now .
This is the first time that I have heard their circumstances .
I thought that my son wanted to escape from being forced
I reflected on myself a lot and I said to him .
`` You do not have to study so much , so that you should stay home anyway . ``
I have heard the sound of walking on the roof .
One day the voice has been heard out of his room , so I tried to open the door of his room .
Then , I saw two boys who hid behind the bunk bed .
I persuaded them about a few things .
I am sorry that you do not keep the promises with me about stopping smoking and studying harder .
How should I do ?
This is my first try to this site .
So I would like to communicate whoever wants to .
I tend to belive in ghost because I was born in small town .
The population of my twon was low .
My neighbor 's house was old so it is easily broken if the typoon come in our regin .
Before I tried to sleep at nigtht I always went to restroom and I can see their house .
I ca n't do anything because I was kizs .
I called my mom : Hey I found a cockroach so please kill them .
comon mom !
hurry up !
I often use something like that .
My high school ( 4 )
They thrilled me nearly throughout the school year of Grade Two .
Of course , I was worried about that my behavior was found as I was enjoying them .
My behavior was found at last .
I was suspended to make a self - examination .
At beginning , though , I found that I could not catch up with my lessons , for I had missed so many lessons .
In this way , it took me four years to finish the three - year junior high school .
She liked a new hosoital because docter explained her well .
It 's very easy level .
I heard it 's good to read many books in suitable level .
Now , the number of words I read is 2666 words .
iPod nano the 5th generation
I bought an iPod nano the 5th generation last December .
So it is not easy for me to use Mac style .
I can import music into iPod nano but ca n't understand the way about any pictures .
Finally , today , I found out how to import some pictures into iPod nano !
I am very happy for doing that .
I had a very busy day today , because I had two classes , checked students ' notebooks , there was a bisiness trip .
I was going to go to conversational English class , but English teacher caught a cold yesterday , so today 's lesson was canceled .
I went to the Mexican restaurant `` El Torito `` tonight and ate Enchilada , Salsa chips , Ceaser sarada , and ice cream and drunk Margarita which was frozen with salt fringe around the glass .
I like Margarita very much , but its alcohol level is kind of high , so I 'm always getting sleepy after drinking .
There are many tv screens hanging on the wall and the tv channel is always sports channel `` ESPN . `` Today 's sports was baseball .
football season will start on August . . . . .
so now what we can watch is baseball games and hockey games .
Today is the Guy Fawkes Night ( or bonfire night ) in Oxford .
Although it is officially the fifth of November , the event is set to Saturday night this year .
Last year my wife and I went to the bonfire held at the South Park .
Although it was a chilling night , the large park was full of crowds .
Guy Fawkes tried to blast the Parliament in order to kill King James I of England and VI of Scotland , but failed and arrested on the fifth of November in 1605 .
The failed assassination attempt is now called as the gunpowder plot .
For some reason , the British have been celebrating this day with bonfire and fireworks for more than 400 years .
I 'm not even sure that the British are either in favour of or against Guy Fawkes himself and his plot .
In my opinion , most of them may be taking advantage of his failed attempt to enjoy fireworks with a good reason .
For me as a Japanese , fireworks on a cold autumn night are very unusual and even surreal experience , since fireworks are icons of the hottest summer season in Japan , reminding me the humid and hot air , girls wearing yukata ( by the way , girls with yukata look 30 % more attractive and prettier then usual ) , kakigori ( crushed ice with fruit - flavoured syrup ) , and so on .
When a British `` guy `` visits Japan and sees fireworks festivals in summer , what sort of emotions would he register ?
Drowsiness
I stayed up all night last night , and so I am terribly sleepy today .
However , I do it .
Because drowsiness harms study , it is necessary to take care .
There is most schools in Japan during summer vacation .
But I must go to school tomorrow .
Our school becomes a rest at the end of this week .
I am looking forward to it very much .
Packers vs . Falcons
The one of the division play - offs is `` Packers vs .
The Falcons has beaten the Packers in this season .
This clip tells me that the next game is too close to call .
This movie 's origin is graphic novel `` WATCHMEN `` , writed by Alan Moore , illustrated by Dave Gibbons .
I can say , `` WATCHMEN `` beat reader 's mind .
What is the evil ?
What is the justice ?
What is the humanity ?
We can be forgiven to sacrifice someone for save the world ?
I had no time to write the Lang - 8 .
I write the Lang - 8 for the first time in a month .

I went out to Yakitori restaurant with my collegue after work last night .
It was so hot during the day , so I wanted to go to a restaurant in which air conditioner works .
When we standed in front of the door of that restaurant , we found the door opened .
I had feeling that what I did n't hope would happen .
Due to hot atmosphere I could drink much beer .
I felt comfortable when wind sometimes blew into the restaurant .
As you might know , yakitori is popular Japanese food .
It is made from several bite - sized pieces of chicken meat , or chicken offal , skewered on a bamboo skewer and barbecued .
It served with salt or with `` tare `` sauce , which is generally made up of mirin , sake , soy sauce and sugar .

Throuth , it is a lot of pressure .
So , I need to study hard now .
I bought some stocks in last Oct .
Since then , I 've been interested in economics so much .
The economics in Japan is easy to be affecteed by that of foreign country ( especially US ) .
Of course not only Japan , many countries ' economics is affected by other countries ' it .
Now , in my country , many people were fired their jobs , and what is worse , it 's difficult for any people to find new job .
There 're many bad news in this way now . . .
However , do n't you think it 's interesting that the relationship of economics between a country and another country ?
I think it 's still too early for me to talk about economics in english .
Since I 'd like to know about these places as much as possible , I am reading guide books and checking the internet every dsay .
I Have Aware
Recently , I 've aware of it 's not easy to earn money .
We never earn money at the time of doing .
Maybe there are some works that can get lots of money a day .

But what makes these two videos totally different .
When it shines , I will hold your hands and together we will walk along the streets
Today I 'd like to talk a story about a drunk who lost his keys .
It 's famous joke , so maybe you have heard .
I think it is a simple story but can teach us important lesson about our life .
One night , a man goes out drinking at a local bar .
After saying goodbye to his friends , he begins walking home , singing happily to himself .
As he nears his apartment , he takes his keys out of his pocket but drops them on the ground in the dark .
On realizing his keys are missing , he wanders over to a nearby street lamp and begins looking for them there .
I had a trouble with my English .
Though I learned English for a long time .
I knew my problem was that I cound 't catch the means what people said , and my pronunciation was too bad .
I wanted to be able to master English conversation , but I spent my much time studying grammar , even I tried to read newspaper and novels .
All study is helpful , but it is n't effective .
It is important for me to know what I want and focus on that .
Japanese comedians sometimes parody foreigner 's Japanese speakings .
The features are omitting particles , wrong accents and intonations and it seems that they can be categorised by nationalities .
I suppose this may be true from my experiences and acutually English children learn nursery rhyme in a language acquisition .
Otherwise , if Japanese learners mimiced their rhythm even if it was strange Japanese , they might obtain a skill to speak naturally .
Junzo Kawada is a researcher in cultural anthropology and he went to Africa to research a tribe that do not have letters .
He clamed that they have imagination in their minds and they convey them to the drum .
When I listened to this story , I thought this is like typing a keyboard .
And there are acutually some rhythm patterns when I hit the keyboard .
It takes about a minuet to the station .

He said you coud get out by no fare , next time you get in our bus , you should tell the driver this story , and pay this fare .
I thanked him , and got out of the bus .
In the way to my home from bus stop , I was soaking wet .

In Japan , It is held 6 times per year ,

Since last Sunday , festival began in Osaka .
It is called `` Haru - basyo `` , it means spring season .
Now , we see some foreign sumo wrestlers , especially from mongolia .

I had planned to go skiing with my family this weekend .
But I canceled when we heard this disaster .
It would have been the first time for my children to go ski .
Recently I had insomnia .
I felt very tired .
What shall I do ?
neck is stiff and back sore too .
What the difference between `` can `` and `` kin `` ?
Today 's work
I have to make a document by this Friday .
I finished making a document today .
I visited one client to have a meeting with my staff .
In this meeting , there was a hard negotiation for us .
We discussed about how to operate this deal .
Finaly we agreed with next discussing points and fixed a next meeting date .
Pollen is blown everywhere .
It become warm and confortable to go outside .
Pollen makes me hey sick .
When I was looking up the word ' agitate ' in dictionary , I found an example which coonfused me .
A big mosquito have bitten me !
There is mosquito in my room .
It looks like very big .
He already eat my blood during I had take a nap a couple of while .
I do n't want live with him all night long . . .
My friend who Japanese listen carefully thier sound then He can know that they are male or female .
I think that if they are male , they do n't want to get my blood .
I ca n't do that like my friend .
But I guess a mosquito which in my room is female .
Because they had bitten my body two points .
I am itching now . . . .
On our project meeting , we talk about what each person try next week .
Anyway , we have a kind of strange custom for christmas .
Eating KFC chiken is one of the example for our unique custom for christmas .
My cousin said my diaries always write so short , but I do n't know what can I write in the diary ?
Mosquitoes are like this weather .
They fly in the house when someone opens the door .
I am in a train on the way to my university .
Whenever I 'm in a train , I 'm observing people in there , especially those who are on the opposite sheat I 'm sitting down .
About 10 people can sit down on the sheat , but I can see 5 people at first sight .
Now , three girls are playing their mobile and two old guys are sleeping .
Ah , the train arrived at the station , so I have to change the train .
As written on this diary of November 4th , one of our managers lectured on cost management .
The measurement of falling birthrate
DPJ 's main policy for falling birthrate is giving 26000yen per one child per month to parents .
I think it 's not enough and not a good policy .
I read an economist opinion on paper that said `` Big company should set up a day - care center for children . `` Same paper said the Itochu , a famous trading company , set up the day - care center .
According to this article , the Mitsui Bussan and the Sumitomo Shoji , which are also famous trading companies , already have their day - care center .
I think the company has its day - care center is very good idea , and very good measurement for falling birthrate .
Most of fathers or mothers should go day - care center on their way to office and they take more time for commuting .
But if their company has day - care center they can go to their office with their children without time consuming .
If day - care center is near their office , they can easily go there to watch their children life .
So I wish many companies set up their own day - care center near their office and many people can work easily with their children .
It 's start my diary .
Recently , everyday is very hot ! !
then I tried sleep agaain .
that was too tired to doin the morning .
I 'm working at adomission center of univercity in Japan .
I do n't like office work , but my colleags is very funny .
so I can keep working my job .
my boss gave us ice cream sometimes .
but I decided to go abrod or take part in working holiday next year .
that it , today .
I have to more studying English .
If you go and look at the moon , it seems that it moves with you .
And , if you 'll look on it carefully , you could notice that it has human 's face , nose , the raised eyebrows , lovely smile . . .
One dark night , then Ira Dmitrieva was coming home , but this moon 's smile was n't lovely for her .
Quite the contrary - the moon `` told `` her very humiliating : `` You 'll se , how you will be met at home .
It 's so late to come there . ``
Ira looked on the ground and thought : `` If only my parents were slipping ! ``
She wanted to blame someone , but she knew that she could n't .
Ira looked fast on the windows , of her flat , on the fifth floor .
Despite Ira 's hopes there was a light in the windows .
`` So , what I should say ?
Ira remembered how sounds the voice of her mum , then she was angry .
Ira was too scared .
I went to watch a movie called `` Broken English `` alone yesterday .
Yesterday , I got a day off suddenly and I wondered what I would do .
Eventually , I watched it , but it was really boring .
It was about a lady who fall in love with a French man .
I thought he could n't speak English fluently and it was the reason of the title , but he could .
He did mistake only one word , it was Angry and Hungry .
He said he was hungry , but she caught he was angry .
It was really funny because his English was really fluently .
I have finished two line drawing ( handmade sketches on paper ) , I intended to color it in class tomorrow , so teacher could correct me simutaneously .
she went to see a doctor in big hospital .
And yesterday , came back her result .
The result of a blood test and CT scan were all normal .
Actually , she was terrible constipation . . . .
Because of my doubts I researched something about this topic on internet and I discovered that for some people it 's not easy .
but I think this test will last five minutes !
The champions league 's 2nd legs of the quarter finals were held yesterday and today .
In quarter finals , Raul who belongs to Schalke got the goals in the 1st leg and the 2nd leg , which gave me goose pumps .
I start lang - 8 today .
I 've been thinking why I want to study English .
Then tonight I got a part of answer .
I have a feeling that it is different from everybody .
But everybody has a something reason why they want to study second launguage .
I want to study hard for explaining my answer .
When I was a child I first watched this movie .
It was amazing , the story line in paticular .
In the last scene of this movie , Doc dropped an important cable on the roof of the school many times .
I alsomost destroyed the TV in anger .
I can imagine , after this movie released , many Amrican kids played with skateboards on the road .
I think the best ways to learn Korean is same as English .
The best way for listening is watching Korean dramas or movies .
I will give to you .
Read aloud even though you do n't understand meanings .
Every day , read aloud Korean books , you will master it .
If you do n't have a friend to talk , you can talk to me through skype .
Maybe , you can speak Korean to your family , even though they do n't understand it .
It is a good practice .
I think it is the hardest one .
The best way is write somethings in this website and ask native Koreans to correct them .
I , actually , hated to study English when I was in high school .
Annirersary Celebration Of My College
April 18th , it 's a special day .
It just be tomorrow and will be bustling with noise and excitement I think .
I will be busy to receive our alumnus in that day , because many alumnus will come to my school with excitement .
Some of them have been great success in society , so they want to see their Alma Mater 's development in recent years .
My school has come through 50 years ' splendid history .
And I anttend it in 2007 , it has developed great .
It 's full name is Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine .
Do you ever gratuate from university ?
Just tell me something of your school .
Drank with my Co - works
Yesterday , I went to drink with my co - works in a IZAKAYA .
I spent few hours reading e - mails .
I could n't finish all of my work today , but I can take another vacation from this weekend .
I 'm looking forward to get the vacation .
I need the certain amount of salary to support my family , however my salary is not good .
So yestarday , I saw some job huntting websites .
Do n't tell me `` Why did not you wait for your marriage until you get a high standard job ? `` At that time I was very desperate to settle down in Singapore .
Needless to say , speaking foreign language like a native speaker is almost impossible for everybody except for native bilinguals .
But for me , `` business English `` sounds like . . . `` almost perfect English . `` As far as I can see , there are not such super Japanese workers .
Are there many Japanese people who can speak English like native speakers somewhere in Singapore where I do n't know yet ?
What the hell business English is it ?
Last night my friend tole me Lang - 8 , and I think it is very good for studay english . .
I wish to make firends with you guys . . .
Today is a beautiful sunny day and Saturday !
I usually spend weekends to go shopping or do excacise or just relax .
I always think that to keep a diary in English is a good way to plactice my English skills .
But , unfortunatly , I quit in a way to do it .
Therefore , I chose to join in this Lang - 8 !
It has passed for 1 year since I came the U . S .
But my English was not improve , one thing that I felt is I am not afraid of English any more even thought I could not what people said .
In other words , I do not care about the surrouding people .
I do n't know it is good or bad .
I have still been eager that I wish I could use English like as native .
Second , I am going to go shopping .
I hope I have a good weekend , and also all of you have that too !
At first , when I did n't understand meanings of new words , I loodked up the words in the dictionary .
But , at that way , I did n't read quickly .
( If the book belong to me , I read by that way .
I understand a content until now and will finish reading by Jun . 21 .
Thank you for watching .
Hello my name is `` pobiron `` , I 'm a university student in Japan .
In the feature I would like to use English in my work .
My friend told me this web site .
And if you know good place for my study abroad , please tell me : D
I will go to the graduate school next year .
In Japan , most graduate students start looking for a job in their first year ( except for those who go to doctor course ) .
I 'd like to experience working in overseas countries before looking for a job .
So , I 'm thinking about taking a year off and joining internship program in European countries .
I wrote that I often licks my lip before .
It was Burt 's Bees of an American souvenir .
I feel my lip is enriched .
I 've not been for a half of year .
It is generally accepthed that our country it is called Japan has been influenced by many great persons across the country .
I think one woman singer is the latest great person who produces powerful effect on Japan .
I would like to write about her impact in this esssay .
For example , she often sings her name in her songs .
Not only songs but also fashion style is so unique .
FOr example , she change her hair colour into strange colours ; white , yellow and green .
Her costumes also sexy and unusual .
Recently , she wore balck onion costume when she appeared on `` Room of the Tetsuko `` which is japanese famous TV program because Tetsuko 's hair style looks like onion .
Firthermore , LADY GAGA gave tetsuko candy that she took out it from her spiral hair .
Many japanese people were so surprised .
I went to baseball game .
I am Hanshin Tigers side .
And I saw someone were using Japanese flags on the bleachers .
Nothing problem , but it does n't fit with baseball game .
Normally they use Hanshin Tigers flag .
Then I could see they were foreigner .
And then I can understand .
It is the most important !
In Japan , that call new year 's `` HOUFU `` .
Most of `` HOUFU `` is about their works .
At Japanese workplace 's party , almost people talk about work .
I tired that topics .
hmm . English is easy , but peoples are regard as stiff .
why are peoples think english very difficult ?
actually , english is very simple , smart .
who do make english difficult ?
english teacher !
they are saying that english is hard to you .
so you needs help such as friend , teacher , and so on .
this is a lie .
When I 'm depressed , I feel everything will be bad way .
I ca n't connect with my boyfriend , because he is at the party and hook up the girl .
One of my friends hav n't replied my e - mail because she got in trouble or she does n't wanna talk with me .
I dreamed somebody of my family die and wake up as I 'm crying .
Actually nothing happend bad things .
How can I wake up from here ?
Today I gave a presentation .
Reagarding long introduction , I could speak well and confidently .
In addition , I did n't get nervous at all .
However , I failed to illustrate next subject .
Anyway I finished it thanks to friends and our teacher .
I felt I needed to make lots of effort to improve my English hereafter .
Someday I want to give a good presentation like other students .
After the lesson , I went to library to return a DVD .
Then , I went to aggency to upgrade my drive licence , but it turned out It seems to me that I wo n't upgrade it .
I need to submit a certification , but it seems like I ca n't get it , As long as I send Japanese embassy for it , I ca n't get it .
After that I went to a bank to hear someinformation to open bank account .
On the way to home , I dropped by an appliance store in Southgate and I bought a portable radio .
John , kind clerk , recommend a good one .
Belive it or not , it works with solar power and it also has the dynamo crank .
Of course I got it .
After that I went to a bicycle shop and they only handle special type bicycle .
It turned out I went in vain .
Anyway finishing the presentation was a big load off my mind .
Oops , I forgot that I would take a final examination tomorrow .
a question
I was watching the big bang theory and characters were using the phrase `` bite me `` and I am wondering what that means ?
by the way this sheldon guy is very funny and whole show is fantastic .
The road in front of my house has cherry trees street .
Only one tree blossom .

I did n't decide anything .

I never want wrong choice .
I think it is my last chance in my life to come true my dream .
I had really good time during the year - end and New Year Day .
However , I have to start my activities from tomorrow .
I have a lot of job interviews in this month .
It must be tough , but I 'll enjoy it .
How to be used to do routine works .
I may be lazy , because I have never planned the schedule .
I thought making schedule was boring .
But situation changes me , recently I must thinking about future .

Next games opponent is Senri higiri .
Result is six to zero .

I solve the exam really fast , and then I went home , to slept .

in Tokyo is raining again . . .

What important lesson have you learned from a family member ?
My parents taught me a lot things .
And they said you have to have a risk if you want to become big .
Also they said it is important to study hard in order to contend with difficulties .
When I have to choose something , I always remember this teachings and think which is really for me in the future in order not to select easy one .
Many kinds of drinks are all free , so that they are self - service .
My favarite comic is `` JOJO ' S BIZARRE ADVENTURE `` published serially in `` A boy Jump `` ( the most famous japanes comic magizine ) .
I do n't finish reading all chapter of `` JOJO ' S BIZARRE ADVENTURE `` , I always read it when I go to an Internet cafe .
It was so fun that I forgot the time when I have to return home .
I have to do the laundry and have a bath .
I speak , of course , of free men who have a choice , not condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly delimited .
For example , listen to music , watch the movie , go to shopping . . .
Because , when I do my favorite things , I can be more relax .
Also , I consult my family or friend .
This will , I will feel better .

I used to write Chinese diaries but later I changed to write English writing and now I give up both of them because I want to you to help me with my English writing and also give myself the chance to practice my English typing speed .
I am not good at it so I tried a lot .
This morning I did n't have classes so as usual I stayed at the self - study room and did some studying .

I have to give a presentation on my graduate school experience for the new freshman today .

Is Japanese liar ? ( in English )
For example , saying `` See you soon `` despite not seeing aftertime , saying `` You speak Japanese very well ! `` when hearing only a few words . . .
For we Japanese these are the unintentional actions or are the actions we want to communicate with other peason smoothly though it seems to be lies if we change our view .
I laughed the example that there is no melon in MELONPAN in Japan ( ~ _ ~ ; )
( In Japan there 's the bread called MELONPAN ( melon - bread ) but there is no melon in it )
Everyone , do you have the moment that you feel Japanese is liar ?
Why do I like sweets very much ?
I ate a tiramisu and a cheese cake today ! !
I like sweets better than diets .
Yesterday night I attended teacher - parent conference , in the conference most of parents were talking about their
children 's academic performance , they think that if their children have low grade , they will lose face .
They only care for test score , not learning process .
In my opinion , test score is just an inspection to children 's former learning .
Parents should more care for their learning process and learning method , and help them overcome difficulties in their learning .
What is healthy life ?
But now it has been changed a lot .
I do n't read books almost , and put meeting off with the excuse that I had too much works to do .

I hope I can keep writing diary in English here .
The baseball team Dodgers is coming to Taiwan .
I 'm so exciting to see the baseball game in Taiwan ! !
The cause of it may be an improvement of my writing skills , but I am not still convinced perfectly .
Why I 'm feeling that speaking is the worst of my English skills at the moment , even though I used to feel speaking was the best .
They sit around my table and they become my conversational partners at that day .
I think my cheerful personality will cause good result .
The other advantage is the existence of conversational partners in front of me .
And also , speaking is a two - way and real - time communication , so we can confirm the meaning each other .
In other words , there is no immediate way to know how much people understand what I wrote .
In addition to the advantage and disadvantage between the types of communication , there is a limitation of my English level .
I really hate that someone misunderstands me .
That 's why I did n't like writing something in English .
And The Daiichi plant has 6 nuclear power stations .
All stations are shut down and especially the 3 out of 6 are dangerous .
This URL is the electoric company 's press release written in English .
I hope this URL will help the people who ca n't read Japanese .

Since I bocame bored American foods , it was very good .
I 've never eaten such good Vietnamese foods .
I ate too much , so I could n't eat dinner anymore .
We really enjoyed lunch with chatting .
San Do told me if we would love to eat good oriental foods , we should go to a restaurant where are lots of oriental people .
I love American supermarkets because it 's very big and there are so many stuff .
I bought some bananas , one super big bottole of fruit juice , a pack of chocolate cookie , ten discounted DVDs ( each one was just 5 dollars . ) and a bottle of perfume .
I also would love to Wal - Mart in Florida again and buy some more DVDs .
My painting teacher , Sand Do is a Vietnamese .
While taking his class , he told me how he has mastered English .
He also watched a bunch of movies in English and mastered English .

He ran and jumped around when he first stepped in his new home .

Resently , I have been studying for 3 or 4 hours a day , but Reading and Listening were mainly large part .
Speaking and writing ware less , particulally , just before Toeic .
To be honest , studying to get highscore was not interesthing moment for me .
I wish I could write diary everyday .
lang - 8 . com is a nice website to improve my English ability !
Now , I 'm on vacations .
What I did - and was really nice - , was going to a rock concert from a local band .
Hope everyone is having fun on summer !
I have a question
I 'm learning english now , but my english is very poor .
how can I improve my english ? oh my god !
Writing diary in English everyday is hard for me .
I could not manage to make enough time for it .
If once we make a line of folding on the pattern , it can not be put away .
The line will never disappear .
Last weekend , it was a long off - day because last Friday was Memorial Day for devoted people in war , such as deceased patriots , soilders and officers of armed forces .
For national holiday and weekend , I had three days to do something .
On Friday , it was a clean day because my parents wanted to be cleaned up wooden floor .
So a half day we cleaned it up , my parents and I were exhausted .
I could n't anything but take a relax .
Last Saturday , I felt down and I 'd like to go out for a walk so I went to Haeundae beach alone .
As you know , sometiems people do n't want to be together , just leave oneself alone .
When I arrived there , there were so many people who enjoyed with family , lovers and friends .
I walked by myself along the beach and sat down sand to do thinking something and seeing sea views .
And I joined the private coversation club for improving English skill .
Every Saturday it helds in Seomyeon .
Because it can be improved my English speech skill and it makes people together as well .
Briefly let you know this club , for five hours people talk about several topics and small talks .
It 's no restrict to join the club , just enrol the website and then you can join it every Saturday .
Once joining this club , I should n't go back home after finishing the conversation .
Usually people go drinking soju and beer lightly .
And something to play sports , such as playing pool , bowling and singing to Karaoke .
Same as usual , we went to play pool after finishing coversation .
We agreed on cost for pool .
but I played with her friend .
I do n't know why I behaved .
I will write a diary of daily events and thought .
Although my writing is awkward text at first , it should make progress every day .
I have been loved reading cartoon since I was a child , especially Japanese cartoon .
Though Chinese cartoon have improved a lot , I still love the style of Japanese cartoon .
The cartoon called `` Rurouni Kenshin `` is an early and special cartoon in my memory .
I do n't know how to express my feeling about this complex expression .
The cartoon called `` Rurouni Kenshin Memories `` is very good , it 's worth to watching .
Then I answered ' Yes , I understand .
Is it correct ?
or I should answered ' Yes , I do .
when should I answered ' Yes , I do .
So I am so happy , but I need to cook by myself , I tried to do my best , I bought many dumpling , It 's easy to cook , I had eaten it two day , Afternoon I play basketball with my friend four hours , I had a good weekend .
`` Terrorism `` is named after terror
Yes I 'm afraid of bombing in the U .
S , especial for Times SQ near my dad lives .
But I think it 's important to realize that we tend to worry too much about risks next to us , and tend to ignore them seems to be far from us .
For example , Swine flu has killed 17000 people in theU .
I guess it will do kill more or less people again .
Can you be making too much of this issue right now ?
Stock masks in case , food and water and check CDC everyday ?
Another example , car accidents kill about 40000 people every year , who can give up driving ?
Yes , we can control risks and our minds .
However , once we trapped fears of small attacks might be happen at YOUR city , `` terror `` can easily over - control our mind .
That make us dumb then we ca n't answer correctly these kind of questions , `` which is more serious ? `` , `` which can kill many ? ``
But right information that we tend to do so will help us to overtake the effects from fears .
Financial crisis makes us easy to loose our temper , so that 's the reason I hope to share this with you .

Today 146th TOEIC was taken place and I took it .
I marked all answer , but I do n't know what score I will get .
For the preparation , I exercised them and read grammar books , instead of writing journals .
I 'm not sure I can get some accuracy for grammar and gain my vocabulary through the exercise .
But I clearly understand I need more speed for reading English .
When I asked some questions about this test for my English teacher , he answered so fast , so quickly .
It was bit strange for me , because these books were written in Japanese and they were reading Japanese more than English .
So , why not will they be able to be sucessful by reading Japanese ?
But newspapers in English have more rich resource of vocabulary .
Therefore , TOEIC is just a turning point .
I want to improve this skill as possible as I can !
I 'm tired now , so I 'll comment for my past journals .
Thank you for correcting my journals , always .
There are many cherry blossoms

My Floridian friend returned to his country .

There are too many memories in my house .
When I see his green sandals that he left in my house , I start to want to cry to remember him .

I want to make an animation a few dialogue .
I want to make animation a few dialogue , because I want to make world - class productions .
I know it 's difficult to do , but I keep trying it .
I read an article on a newspaper about the Japanese economy two days ago .
As you already know , Japan became the super aging society , old people who will retire a few years later are very desperate to protect their positions in their own companies .
For old people , young job applicants and workers are just nuisance , because If young workers enter a company , the company may fire old workers who have been taking good payments for a long time .
Old workers are afraid of it .
So sometimes old workers bully young workers until new workers quite .
Old people always dare to give us useless lectures , like `` Contemporary young people do n't make efforts at all `` and `` They want to get only high standard jobs , there are many jobs they can do , even though payments are not good , why are their ideal so high ? `` Maybe they have never read job advertisements at all .
They do n't have dicks and bowls .
Thank you for your advice for my PC .
I have n't investigated my PC closely yet .
It ends up on the back - burner .
It might be the same as some people postpone going to the hospital when they do n't feel well because of busyness .
On my previous entry , I asked about `` to persuade `` and `` to convince . ``

Ego and other person
I said to him `` can I help you ? `` or `` what are you looking for ? ``
At welcome party , he said to me that he was surprised to be given a hand by me .
I am not sure that I completely understood what he told to , but I would like to summarized what he said .
They value the autonomy .
They do not give a hand to other person without one 's demand .
They think that he does not need to help when he says anything .
These are common thinking in Japan .
I took care of him with a Japanese way .
That was a culture shock .
It has been a long time since I became uncertain of the orchestra conducting , but today I learned something .
Maybe it can be a breakthrough .
Tangled thread in my head may be unraveled .
I found I was excited in the train back to Tokyo .
Whether I can get hold of it or not depends on how I spend everyday .
When I woke up , I completely feel good .
I think it 's because of going to bed early .
We went there for helping my parents ' work .
It was a little bit hard work though , we enjoyed helping them out .
I guess I can sleep tight tonight and feel better and better tomorrow .
Yesterday I donated my blood , hoping my bloodcan save someone 's life , for the first year in 2011 .

I will give surprise to her at the Christmas .
last night our teacher talked about the dream of red mansition with us .
this novel was one of the most famous novels written by Cao XueQin who lived in Qin Dynasty .
this novel now has several versions .
but I think the first version is the most popular .
recenty , another director make another version .
This one like a nightmare .
make up and music are very horrible like a ghost film .
the actor and actree are very young so they do n't know how to perform this tv show .
the dialogue almost repeat from the novel .
there are many voiceover throughtout the tv show .
I need to prepare the exam related to my work which I 'm going to take next week .
I also want to take more time for learning English , but I ca n't manage to do both of them .
I wish I could be a little better to do multiple tasks .
driving schools graduated last week .
I want to take a licens soon !
I m interested in japan and korean culture .
I love animes and mangas .
I think Japan should focus more on relations with other nations because there are several reasons why I think so .
Secondly , in Asian nations , Japan is the only advanced nation so Japan should show other nations about how to deal with internationa relations with European nations and the United States .
Japanese people have been working hard and politicians and diplomats have been making good relations with United Stated and European nations .
One was Japan should focus more on relations with other Asian nations because Japan should take a role as a leading nation in Asian countires .
The other reason was Japan knows a lot about relations with European nations and America so we should use the advantage to communicate and have a good relation with other nations .
My desk in the office is usually much neater than most of my colleagues .
However a lot of hardcopy documents have been piled up on my desk and the drawer has been full of them recently .
I decided to take some time and to check the documents whether they were really necessary for me or not .
To my surprise , the result was that I could reduce them to one fifth .
If you have some trouble in your work , I recommend that you should clean your desk .
I do not understand how to remember English .
First of all , I want to speak an easy daily conversation .
From what should I start studying ?
I went to Cherry Blossoms with my wife last sunday .
We bought the coffee and the cake .
We enjoy eating cake and coffee under the Cherry Blossoms at the river side .
Everyone enjoy cooking BBQ and palying lite sports .
I had relax time .
came the branch
Today is holiday and It 's a nice weather .
If I have palans , I think I go to somewhere . but . . . . . ! !
I did n't have plans today . so , I woke up at 11 : 00 . and then I ate lunch and watched DVD and played ukulele .
If It 's nice day tomorrow , I will go to somewhere !
What a bother .
That remains me , I have to finish my homework by the day after next .
Please teach this reason in detail .
I found that I 've been written my journal in English around for 70 days .
I want to express my idea or my feeling in English more and more .
Before writing a journal , I did n't pay attention nouns .
Though there are two kinds of nouns ( one is countable noun , the other is uncountable noun ) in English , we do n't have such ideas in Japanese .
I especially do n't understand about abstract nouns .
On the other hand , I tend to think how I express Japanese phrase in English every day .
For example , while I talk with my friend , I think how I express this feeling in English .
Then , when I talk with my English teacher , I often replied with two or three words before , but I tent to be able to reply completely sentence which I made , even though my completely sentences are wrong most of cases .
However , if I keep practicing these things , I will be able to master English someday .
Therefore , I think keeping a diary is one of the best way indeed
I keep on jogging of an hour almost every night for three months .
Though Christopher recommended running using low - cushion shoes in this book , I think there is a risk to hurt a foot for beginners .
Actually , I hurt my feet using Vibram FiveFingers .
So , although I do n't know I can run the whole distance , I decided to try a full marathon in April and ultramarathon in June .
The tree - planting ceremony was held near my place .
It was a very big ceremony there .
It was because the Emperor and Empress came to plant trees by themselves .
There are many roads had been repaired , re - paved or newly made around and towards the park where the ceremony was held for the ceremony in advance .
The Emperor and Empress sowed some seeds and planted by hand some seedlings of trees including pollen - less cedars .
It was pity that it rained all the time during the ceremony , but many other attractions were there , that was some dances , reading some essays , etc .
We wish the trees will grow up healthily and we will could keep the beautiful mountain and nature .
This is my first diary .
I got together with my friends to have OKONOMIYAKI party today .
Okonomiyaki , which looks like a pancake , is a kind of local food in Japan .
We enjoyed eating them with talking .
In adition , we watched JUDO game in olympic .
It was pity that Japanese player could n't win a first praise .
Each country 's national debt breeds distrust of world economy after the crisis in Greek .
After Lehman 's fall , the global depression has necessitates fiscal action , so it seems to be natural that the debts are growing large .
In addition , Japan keeps current - account surplus , so Japan might be considered to be relatively stable .
Without good prospect for rapid improvement of each country 's current account , the crisis of default seems to get more serious , and I think the crucial period is yet to come .
I loged in this site Lang - 8 first time .
Because English tutor gave me this URL .
I will try write my diary in English from today . . . !
`` You will go far a place where you do n't know where is nor how long is for .

It rains from the weather of recent Japan of saying , `` Guerrilla downpour `` .
We held a dinner after that .
I enjoyed it but my body pains me now !
I was shorked with how many detailes I have to understand and memorize .
Maybe I got the premonition that I could pass or failed this exam by a very small margin .
If I have time to complain about how difficult this is , I 'd better to spend the time reading one more page .
It 's so busy a day .
I rarely have time to write something .

If I do n't have to go to work I 'm sure now sitting in a coffee shop , drinking my favourite coffee and chatting with my friends .
I want to come back times when I were still a student , I can stay in bed longer when it 's cold or can go out with my friends in a beautiful day like this .
I miss these days .
Because it 's cold so when going out I have to wear a thin coat ( I usually just wear it when it 's hot ) , ah I should buy another new coat .

Parents shouldnt be seen their bad habits or behaviors by their children .
This is because children tend to imitate quikly what is occured in front of them .
If a parent littered , their child would think simply that it isnt worse and rapidly he or she would imitate the bad behavior .
this is bad .
Besides , once children fall into a bad habit it is difficult to get out of it .

' Inundate ' is the water attack .
Just ten years ago in 1998 , it was amid the years called later `` Lost Ten Years `` .
In the summer of the year , prime minister Keizo Obuchi , who had just inaugurated , performed in front of a fruit and vegetable store .
I think many can remember that .
The chain reaction of falling stock prices raided again at the world market , while we thought it was put an end to .
The prices in Tokyo market were the second highest rate of decline in the wake of the plunge in New York .
According to the estimation of a private research institute , the value of indivisual shares and investment trust funds had gone down by about100 trillion yen between the end of June last year and the end of September this year .
It is too merciless for the people who have invested the savings and the allowance for retirement for their post - retirement years .
According to stock traders , the plunge in New York market last week is because of the anxiety about U . S .
finance system , but that of this week is because of the clearer tendency of the recession .
If the actual economy in U . S .
is really aggravated , it is very severe for Japan , which mainly depends on exports .
Though there is a brief recovery from `` Lost Ten Years `` , it is said that economy in Japan is also at the stage of recession .
I hear government and the parties in power have begun to study the adding economic policies .
People want effective policies not lip services .
I think real autumn has come at last .
When I read this book , I thought that my bocabrary of English is row revel .
I repeatelly consulted an English - Japanese dictionary .
This book 's picture is very pretty .
I enjoyed reading this book , but I thought that want to study English very hard .
Once you use a Mac you can not go back to Windows PCs , because Mac is useful , smart and so cool .
A truck pad on the laptop type of Mac recognizes the number of your fingers on it .
If you have an iPhone I strongly recommend you buy a Mac .
This was because an even was held there .

What will I been doing in the holidays ?
I have to think about it : )
Now , I 'm eating spaghetti for my dinner .
This is cooked by myself .
I boiled noodles for six minutes .
Next , I mixed noodles and tuna ,
As a finish , I poured soysource over noodles and dusted a piece of dried bonito .
`` Japanese noodle `` has been completely ! !
It 's very dericious .
As I commented on a diary March 27th , a magazine reporter and a photographer came to our gym and got a story .

Please come to my Japanese blog if you have an interest in Kendo , music and Japanese life .
Today we went to city hall ( industial cultural center ) for nominated environmental ecology .
We are ecogcal family ! ?
I could not believe .
But today was excited and enjoyed .
I 'm a soft spoken person , and sometimes people ca n't hear me especially in noisy places .
There are tips and advices for people who have the same problem ( as mine / like mine / with me ) < - which one is correct or more natural ? .
Smoke a pack of cigarette everyday , yell all the time . . . .
Yesterday , I went to a Noraebang ( a room for singing in S .
Korea , little different from karaoke in Japan ) to feel better .
These days , I have been depressed a bit .
My English does n't seem to get better especially in speaking , and also felt bad when my favorite english teacher kept saying like ' I ca n't hear you . ' last class .
When I sang songs there , I realized that my voice is not quiet ( basically / naturally ) , just I talked usually quiet .
I will try to speak loud as much as possible .
I may feel like I 'm yelling , but I also noticed that itt is not when I recorded and heard my voice .
I hope you enjoy good food and have fun in Thanksgiving Day !
In my spare time , I often hire some comic films , not only the new and also the old classic movies .
Especially when I encouter a sad or unhappy thing , I would like to watch a comic movie .
And then I would forget those annoyances , and get a pleased mood .
We watch comedy not just get fun from it , but also we can get some life philosophy .
There is much we can learn from him , not only his movies , but also the person himself .
I have been doing work exactly for 1 year until now .
Touched working I have discovered a few disadvantages myself .
In fact , I 'm weak that I got some mistakes of processes at work and I felt a bit unhappy that time .
Actually I care so many things of my work .
I do n't know why am I care this so ?
Weak and sensitive I did n't know these disadvantages when I was a student .
By the way , it 's very different between the part time and the full time job , so I do n't have any presumptions at work anymore .
Every opportunities for working are all good try and which one must be suitable for each person .
It was raining , so I went the nearest station by car after I took my son to kindergarten .
( Usually , I go there by bicycle to exercise . )
I had expected there would be only me in this lesson , but another trainee was there .
She visited there from the next city that this lesson was held .
It took about 40 minutes by limited express , according to her .
Before the lesson begins , we chatted away .
We talked about our backgrounds .
She entered high school in Australia , graduated from the school and then entered college there .
After she came back to Japan , she worked at a hotel .
There was once a time , I used to work as a hotel staff . )
As for the lesson , it was challenging , but rewarding like last time .
; D We have to learn the teaching methods in a short period and do a lots of homework every time .
There 're 24 hours in a day . . . .
Well , I should n't neglect my routine English study to brush up on my English skills .
I went to Beijing Museum of Natural History today and it was very exciting .
Apprently , it is popular with kids , but I think it is also a good place for adults to learn more about the mother nature .
Scientists found that in the last fifty years of twentieth century , hundreds of thousands of species had been extinct on earth .
As a result , when scientists are studying the six mass extinctions of organism in natural history , they find surprisingly that the earth is experiencing the seventh mass extinction of organism right now .
Features of The Seventh Mass Extinction of Organism
The past six mass extinctions all happened during thousands or millions of years , whereas the current rate of species extinction , according to caculations , is much greater compared to before .
The extinction of modern organisms are due to human 's activities .
Human is the only species that can result in the mass extinctions of other species in the history of life .
People 's economic activities like the over - exploiting of forest and excess reclamation lead to the changing of envionment of other species .
Pollution from human activities endanger the survival of wild lives .
Because of the population explosion , people are competing with animals for resources , which also results in the extinction .
from yesterday , I go into the test weeks , I have to study for test of my scool .
So I am too busy to keep diary . . .
We had a meeting with our big cliant in thier office today .

So , I want to talk with him about global dynamics , human life and so on at drinking spot with light meal .

I 've studied English so long and I can listen and understand what native speakers say .
But I have to admit I ca n't speak enough .
I want to reach the level that I be able to make a good presentation in front of audience .
Sometimes I become desperate and feel that nobody can achieve to reach that level unless you lived in other countries when you were young .
But the idea was mistake .
I came to that conclusion when I see a presentation done by a president of a company .
He graduated from American Business school .
But he had n't been to US before the business school .
He did a excellent presentatin about his expertise and his business .
He answered all the question with sense of humor .
Now I believe I can be good english presentator someday if I keep studying .

If children play out side and contact many bacteria , they might prevent allergic disease .
Furthermore , there are several reports that some food including bacteria work well with our body .
For example , yogurt including lactic acid bacteria is believed to make us healthy and prevent disease , because these bacteria strengthen the immune system .
However , it is still unclear how much the probiotics affect the immune system and prevent disease .
Our environment including our body has already many bacteria and we are exposed by them all time .
The most of data as beneficial to our body are clamed by companies producing fermented foods .
There are research conflicts and we need much more study fairly .

Thank you for reply so soon .
ETS is the most effcient institution I have ever seen .
I deeply appreciate that you take my problem as your concern .
But I still have one more question about the process of changing my name .
My situation is , I did n't know that I made a mistake on my name until the staff of the test center told me , that is , they told me that just before the test began .
So my question is :
`` Is the test center obligated to report it to ETS if they found there 's inconsistency between the name of registration and the passport the student showed ? ``
The reason why I ask this question is that I have some friends they also made mistakes on their name , however , the staff of the test center help them report it to ETS .
Eventually , all of them corrected their name successfully !
Okay , let 's get back to the question .
If the answer is `` YES `` , then I could ask for damages from the test center I took test in .
Because of their negligence , I spent 160USD and get nothing !
My TOEFL score would be invalid becuase that they did n't have my name correct !
If the answer is `` NO `` , then I will cast doubts on the reliance of ETS .
In other words , anyone could replace me to take this test .
The staffs of test center knew that there is a mistake on my name , but they still let me take the test .
I am just a poor student who want to study abroad .
I only earn 350USD per month , and the test took me almost half of my salary .
All I want is a fair test .
I know I make the first mistake , it 's my fault .
But there are others who made same mistakes then got repair .
We have same problem but end up with different consequence .
Thank you for your reply again ! !
Really appreciate .
Sincerely yours ,
In the middld of night I woke up by some terrible sound .

I often have had nightmares since broke up .
Therefore , I am in a state of poor mind at work .
How long does this condition continue ?
Day before yesterday , and yesterday , I played in a band .
I played that song was `` HEAVEN `` ( Janne da arc ) , `` God knows `` and `` Empty color days `` .
After I have read the article about `` Are you happy with life ? `` from the newsgroup .
Then , I ask myself .
I do n't really know I am happy or not .
Sometimes , I would to like to want more and more pretty clothes even I have had much clothes already .
My mother always scold me , `` Why are you buy so much clothes , but could n't see me wearing the clothes ? `` Heehee , I do n't know why I just want to buy it at that moment .
After I went home , I felt I have bought the wrong things and felt unsatisfied .
On the other hand , when my friend annoyed me , I will feel angry for a few days .
But , After a week , I will felt nothing at all .
So , every little things can make me happy , and every little things can make me dispressed .
I do n't know how to reply this question .
Today I went to restaurant with my family .
It was the last chance that we were all rest in this summer .
My father said Let 's eat delicious lunch !
We could eat anything for Thousand Yen , but my father had 4 meal tickets , so we could eat free ! : D
There were a lot of delicious foods !
For example , French cuisine , Chinese food , Japanese food , and desserts ! !
I ate my fill heartily , but my family ate more .
My father and brother ate three times as much as I do !
It 's rainy today .
so I did speaking slowly .
I 'll study English Pronunciation harder tomorrow .
Rich countries often give financial aid to poor countries , but it does not solve the poverty , so rich counties should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than the financial aid .
Currently , it is not uncommon for rich counties offer financial aid to the poor countries , for the sake of helping them shake off poverty .
But the effort seems not effective enough that many impoverished countries still suffer from poverty and other problems .
Therefore , which form of aid should be offered to the poor countries has been a topic of discussion .
Some people are convinced that wealthy countries should offer aid in alternative forms such as education or technology instead of strictly financial support .
There is no doubt that one country can not develop to be a strong one while it always relying on other countries help .
It is the development of education and technology that can really push one country to become a wealthy one .
When a country is so poor that it can not develop its own education and technology by itself , the assists that served with education and technology from rich countries can make a great effort .
India is a country which used to be so poor that can not afford the huge domestic cost , but it become more powerful than ever before due to the development of computer technology , which is benefit from the technology aids from developed countries .
Apparently , most poor countries rely on direct financial support to relieve pressures of poverty , which can use in different ways to alleviate the poverty , such as buying foods for hungers and buying military equipment for the stability of the country .
The citizens of such countries will suffer from hunger and disturbance if financial aid is withdrawn .
The main issue should be how the poor countries make good use of these aids in a proper way to improve the wellbeing of the citizens .
I just learnt a phrase `` To the core . `` so I would like to make a sentence .

A bad news
To an ordinary chinese famer , cancer maybe the last illness he want to be related with .
What he gets from hard work can only make for his daily necessities .
They never ask anything more in their lives .
A weeks ago , he was diagonsed having liver cancer .
Going to Shanghai and receving operation can rescue him .
All those will cost at least 150000 yuan .
Where to get money ?
We relatives also ca n't give him a hand , since we are all poor .
In fact , China is stronger than before , polarization of rich and poor is deeper .
When would medicine system be perfect ?
And famers wo n't worry about illness one day ?

It was assigned by my teacher and going to present at next 's thursday .
After finishing it , I fell asleep soon .
Suddenly , I felt my bed shaking , then the whole building too !

I thought about what should I do if the next big shake comes , like the stuff bringing with and the calling to my sleepful mother .
Fortunately , after a while , it seemed like no more earthquake would come , and I fell asleep again soon .
In fact the situation has been quite often at Taiwan , where the coutry have located at a active seismic belt .
It 's not first time for me , though .
I still felt it scaring , especailly the terrible one in China had just passed by .
It took so many people 's life , made thousands of people homeless , and crushed China 's economics .
I really can do nothing to be against the nature .
Maybe all we can do is to accept it and be stronger .
We should not blame on the nature , or anything .
It 's not revenge of earth .
It 's not a bad omen for 2008 Olympics , either .
It is just a natural event for human to become solidified and accustomed to it .
I very pity the victims of that earthquake .
I Hope they could go through the disaster soon .

I don ` t know whether you know about this game .
This game was created in Belarus , Mr .
The basic idea of game consists in performance of various tasks for districts for a while .
The winner of game the player or a command , is considered the first finished all levels .
Thus the quantity of tasks , sequence of their performance , time for performance of one task are not regulated by rules and established by authors under their discretion .
Game passes at the night .
And all the night your friends and you travel about the city , solve riddles , search for codes and treasures in the most improbable places .
It can be both the thrown not completed building and the thrown garages .
It usually takes some time to write down my ideas / thoughts .

A lot of land mines which were removed by Aki Ra are on display in the museum .
Many civilians were slaughtered by the Khmer Rouge .
There are so many victim 's bones and skulls in the memorial tower .
I told with tuktuk driver about a lot of things .
He told me about the Khmer Rouge , Pol Pot and so on .
He can speak English fluently and can speak Japanese a little .
We told in mixed English and Japanese .
I wondered why he does n't become a tour guide .

Left - handedness
I 'm left - handed .
Many years ago , in Japan , left - handed persons were rare .
There is a reason .
Many parents thought that lefties would lead inconvenient lives - for example , most of tools are made for right - handed persons .
They forced their children to use tier right hands .
In fact , I had some trouble in cutting things with scissors , and my parents made me use my right hand .
Happily ( ? ) I have been writing or using tools with my left hand .
However , for the last four or five days , many teachers in Japan have pointed out that the number of left - handed children has been increasing .
And we had a hand - rolled sushi - party .
We can chose ingredients and put them and rices on a laver and roll it by ourselves .
But I heard that many Europeans and Americans do n't like laver .

Diet success is how do you think ? ?

About advice .
Do you follow advice when you asked for it ?
Most of people I know tend not to .
I do n't judje them - everyone knows that it 's easy to give advice to others .
Sometimes they just tell me : `` Sorry , but you do n't quite understand my situation `` or `` Thank you for your opinion , but it still seems too complicated for me , I need to think about it some more before I make any dessision `` .
But sometimes it turns just ridiculouls .
My friend tells me : `` I need your advice `` and at the moment I feel all importance and responsibility of the question .
- I was going to somewhere with somebody .
But then I let them down , and now they are cross with me .
I analyse and try to find the best words to explain my point of view .
I think about my friend 's and friend of her 's feelings and do my best to be unbiassed .
I explain it to her and when I 'm done I feel like my peice of advise is n't a bad one .
And I know what it means : I 'd rather just pretend that nothing have happened .
Well , but I glad that her problems was not that serious as she told me .
People always need some support , but never need anyone to told them what to do !
That is my opinion about advice ^ _ ^

These days I often read Japanese literatures because they are in my new electoronic dictionary .

Yesterday I cought this phrase in Obama 's speech made at G20 in Central London .
For me , participial constructions sound very formal so I 've only seen in written English or heard in someone 's speech so far .
or does this sound awkward as a daily expression ?
pity that I dont have a mate to share that beautiful sceans with .
What a crazy weather !
The weather cast said , it will be snowing again in March .
The global warming seems like very serious .
Pohang was n't the place snowing too much like this year .
It 's hard to keep a garden clean and particularly in summer ,
plants grow thick .
If you do n't weed your garden for one week in the summer , it 'll get just like a jungle soon .
And then , we have to care about a shortage of water , too .
In addition we have to get rid of worms .
We all rouse our goblets happily except one classmate .
I asked the waitress if there was any graph fruit juice .
There is a desk , bed and so on .

Last time when we had come to clinic , he never stopped crying , so we had had to come back home without treatment .
After sniffing up an opiate , he became like drunken .

I bought the text books that are used at accounting subject of american university .
I graduated from japanese university .
But I must study as a freshman .
It is very fresh for me to study as a student , and I am reminded of my youth : )
Same as former British Prime Minsiter Margaret Thacher ( spelling ? ) , so I 'm also an iron lady ! !
So many people are learning English and looking for a techer to correct their language , but not so many native English speakers here . . .
It 's fun for me to correct sentences for Japanese learners so I would perhaps concentrate on correcting their Japanese for a while and wait for more English speakers to join Lang - 8 ! ?
try to Lang - 8

Why I choose to work as an au pair ?
On the 15th of July of the last year I came to London with the idea of work like waitress , cleaner or something like that , so I rent a room in a shared house in the east suburb of London and started to look for a job .
One week later , I still not having sheets in my bed cause my landlady had n't bring them yet .
for 4 persons .
And , on top of that , the shower head work only if you put it at no more than 10 centimetres from the bottom of the bath .
But at least I liked to have a shower standing up !
So , I checked all the possibilities : au pair , hotel waiting staff , try another shared house , . . .
I thought pros and cons of every job and finally decided to make an au pair profile in a specialty website and look for a family .
And that 's the reason for why I ended working as an au pair .
( The next chapter will be looking for a family )
I 'm bored so I 'll write here something ^ ^ .
Currently I have to stay at home because I 'm ill ; _ _ ; I have a chickenpox !
Next month I should move out from my little city < finally ! > .

Today I listened to a song Tunami .
Tunami was sung by a Japanese rock band Southern All Stars .
I watched youtube movie about it .
Tunami is a disaster like earthquake .
Japan has recently been attacked by big one .

I think I need learn English . . .
a word in ( a ) . . .
actually is `` something `` in the blank , but grammatically it is better to be `` anything `` , which we Japanese are always careful about .
Recentley , I 'm working very hard at part time jobs to earn money .
For example , I worked at a bread shop from 6 : 00am to 4 : 00pm except 10 : 30am to 11 : 30am as a break , after that , I worked at a chinese restaurant from 6 : 30pm to 10 : 00pm .
Today , I worked at bread shop from 6 : 00am to 14 : 00 except 1 hour break , and from 5 : 30pm , I 'm going to go to the chinese restaurant to work .
One of the stereotype of Japanese is `` working hard `` , and I think I 'm just the stereotype Japanese now . : - (

About 2 hours after , they said that the Contiental Airplane can help us that change the another airplane and we can go on trip right away .
Then I have to the Terminal and go to the another gate in order to I can go to Pensacola as quickly as possible .
Sharn 's first trouble was ended .
In 8 : 30 I arrived in the Houston international airport , whn I prepared to go to another borading gate , the flight number and destination was changed , I ask the fornt desk of Contiental Airplane and they told that this flight was cancelled cause the bad weather on the north of the America and So I had to stay in a hotel in one night .
However , when I took a phone call to the hotel to ask the room , the staff told me that there was no more space in this hotel , So I have to go to Contiental Airplane service center to told them to change the hotel because this hotel was full , then they help me to contacted another hotel which has a room to rent .
Finally I arrived the hotel to took a nap and prepare the flight in next day .
In 5 : 30 mar 27 , I was catching up the Shuttle Bus bewteen hotel and airport . 7 : 20 , I have boarded on plane which 's destnation is Pensacola and 2hour later , I arrived safely .
In conculsion , this is my first time to travel abroad on U .
My daughter 's front upper tooth is loose these days .
We was waiting for the tooth coming out , I found some of the tooth was getting violet during yesterday dinner .
The middle of the back got to be red .
I 'm worried about it and called the dentist this morning .
The doctor told me that it 's no problem , even if a loose baby tooth is getting violet or red , but he 's not sure if it 's fine unless he looks at it .
Then I made a appointment for her .
It 's fifteen to six today .
I ran a marathon , 42 . 195km , yesterday .
It was too hot to run a long distance , even to do any other exercise outdoors .
I poured water over my head some times too .
I ran in the shade as possible to minimize the exposure to direct sunlight .
It was very tough again , but I did it .
I 'm looking forward to see .
Today , I drew a picture for a Band of my friends .
the picture ( a man standing by the sea as sun shining ) will be printed on T - shirts .

But my foot and back hurts .
Oh my god , tomorro is Monday again and we have to hand in our weekend homework , but there are so much homework to do .
I hate writing down the English sentences that I wrote in wrong ways for so many times .
It does n't make any effect on my English learning !
What I need to do is just correct in one time and remember them so that I wo n't make the same mistakes again .
Oh I really do n't realize what the teachers are thinking .
Bless me . . .
I attended to a Christmas party in church on last Saturday that was held for working people .
They held many simple games .
There remain last 4 people and 3 chairs .
A girl of them , who is my friend , took off the chair another girl was trying to sit on and she fell on her backside !
It was unbelievable for me because I 've done same thing when I was child and my teacher scolded me so much .
Some people say it 's an international school , might be . . , but in fact it 's a lot more than that .
It 's a non - profit organization that brings students from around the globe together , students are selected on merit through a total or partial scholarship program , so the ability to pay is n't taken in count at all .
I want one of those scholarships so bad , it 's my dream to get to know more of the world , get to know a lot of cultures , to be able to speak foreign languages fluently .
And being able to learn all of that from people with such different backgrounds , it 's what makes UWC so special to me , it 's the perfect place for everything that I want to do .
I just ca n't imagine the way it would n't impact on my life , such a wonderful experience .
My brother often made me sad since he had finished the service in the army .
He began to smoke and play game day and night in cybercafe .
For this , my little sister and I had to often find him to cybercafe .
His phone was always closed and he did 't go to home to sleep at night .
I remebered for waiting him , result in weeping all night .
My parents hoped that he can go to China with them together and they maybe change his temp and bad habits .
But he insist to stay in Taiwan and keeping bad behavior , he made us pain and helpless .
Today my father was rare to come to Taiwan , I was very happy .
And then my brother sid that he had a test . ( I do n't trust him , he had to be go to cybercafe . )
So we waited him until 6 o ' clock , he did 't still come home and my father lose his temper .
( If it 's time at 10 : 00 o ' clock and he does 't still come home , we decide to lock the door . )
At 8 : 00 , when my brother came home , we were preapring for shouting at him .
Suddently he said that I decided to go to China with father , because I ca n't hold on myself .
We were so surprised and began to open our smiles .
It 's so surprising that I cant believe it !
I always really worry him .
Althought I do n't know he go to China if it is a good thing , he want to change himself make me happy .
It 's one of Japanese Holiday today .

A lot of things happened this month .
I ca n't describe all things but our family is very good now .

We always worry his family .

The trip in Athens does n't make me relaxed .

Hawaii Vol , 2
Today , I write about my trip again .
There was vivid magenta Bougainvillea near the Kailua beach park .
It was delicious a fruit salad I ordered .
This beach is very famouse about that the sea turtle come to have sunbath .
At this time , there is no sea turtle on the beach , instead there is a hawaiian monk .
He was big and just sleeping on the beach .
I think that all systems in this world has an advantage and a disadvantage .
I have many homework .
So I 'm going to go to library to do it . . . . .
Instead of did n't do it , I got great memories ! !
Today , I went to a dentist .

but I have to go tmw again for my teethridge .
I do n't know why I have a cavity dakneunde , I take a brush on daily .
Baby has come !
The year 2011 has started with bringing a new baby to my family .
His older brother , Pax likes to take care of him .
It 's lovely to see the older trying to hold the little one and to hear what he talks to the baby .
People say the older one often gets jealous to the new comer and acts nasty , or behaves like a baby .
Yes , I can see now Pax sometimes pretends to be a small baby - he wants to suck my breast a little and he crawls .
I look forward to seeing how they grow their relationship between two brothers .
I hope they can be the best friends with each other .
I 'm Began to learn English
I 'm university student .
( looks like a fencing ) I started it at elementary student .
So I 'm playing Kendo so long time .
Last year I went to France Toulouse one month .
there was a very good place ! !
It was very funny , because firsttime I try to speak French but I could n't communicate with people well .
So after few days , I became always using English .
I 'm interested in the culture of various country .
I want to talk with different country people .
The Project Manager should have a set of skills or techniques , including the abilities to raise the sharp questions , detect the unknown assumptions , and solve the confilicts between people , etc .
, and including many skills in modern management as well .
The major responsibility of the Project Manager is to identify different risks to affect the success of the Project , which should be measured by formal or informal ways throughout the whole project 's lifetime .
Risks always generate from the uncertainty of the project .
A successful project manager often takes the risks as the matter being paid much close attention to .
I agree with such a opinion as a qualified project manager is not only from studying but more from practicing .
I will go on a school trip in Hokkaido on September 15 ~ 18 .
I have never been to Hokkaido so I 'm looking forward to going there .
In fact , I hardly know about there .
So I do n't teach you the information .
But I will tell you the memory when I return a school trip .
I firstly read Japanese version when I was 6 or 7 years old .
This is a second book of the series `` My Father 's Dragon `` as you know .
Its English is easy but it makes me clearly imagine each scene .
The rhythm of sentences are easy to read .
This story begins with the scene in which the dragon saved and flied away from the island where the ferocious animals had locked him .
9 - years Elmer saved the dragon .
Now they were on their way home .
First they set on Tangerina Island with many of tangerines .
After suffering from storm , they flied down to a little green island .
At that place they met canaries whose king were sick of curiosity .
This is the end of the former part .
The latter I will write tomorrow .
Because , I studied with my friend K , about optimistic training for special education children .
I have wanted to this study for long time .
So , I felt that today was a day of my dreams came true !
So , I felt satisfied that time .

The movie which I like is a fine feeling and a feeling gentle .

Everytime he came to our house before , he brought us something nice and exotic from China , but that night he ran out of the souvenoirs he had brought from home .
So he handed out to my daughters two plastic cages , one for each , in which a little creature was making rattling noises on the pebbles .
I love animals but I had never cared for reptiles so much .
To my surprise , I told our guest a white lie , saying that the turtles he brought were so cute .
Years passed and they grew .
I once brought them to a vet when they got sick ( symptoms - - - no appetite and swollen eyes , treatment - - - two shots ) and spent 200 dollars .
Now I love them .
It 's so funny that love comes out of nowhere .
It 's pure emotion .
My daughter has named the turtles Mai - chan and Chibi - chan , but I 'm secretly calling them Julia and Robert .
I 'm very excited now , for I 've known this site .
I 'm learning English and want to improve my English .
I did n't know there is a useful website like this .

On monday morning if you have breakfast in an Italian bar you 'll listen comments about the result of sunday football matches .
In Italian championship there are 20 teams ( in Premier League ) ; the teams with the best players are : Juventus , Inter , Milan and Rome .
Every sunday the teams begin playing at 3 o ' clock p . m . , the match lasts 90 minutes .
Soon after the end , sports programs airs on tv till 7 p .
There are link - ups with sports journalist in each stadium , interviews to the coaches or players and images of several goals , corner kicks , free kicks , penalty kicks , expulsions , warnings and failed goals .
After prime time , other sports programs start again for those who in the afternoon did n't stay at home watching the television .
On monday morning after `` a day `` television commentaries there are also those of the fans !
Why did I decide like that ?
Actually I do not remember that why I chose the word .
I would be able to call `` nomad `` to me .
Because I have been unable to stay one place 3 months more .
Because of that experiences , I could do the job with various skills .
I do not know my schedule how long to stay here .
Although many people living in this accomodation is getting worried
I can experience diversed life styles with this time in Australia .
At least , I will exactly predict that I think I get good experiences in Austraila
if I am back to South Korea .
Do you know a news that a merican guy got $ 232 million jackpot ?
I ca n't even image the amount of it !
A real lucky guy !
I wish I were him .
But I worry him a bit this gigantic mone drive him crazy or make him ruin his life .
Mass media overly report him .
I know this is an affair get viwer attention , including me .
I think they should think over again their sensation - seeking nature .
I hope people surrounding him leave him alone a little .
when I drew a deep breath I feel better .
but I feel being lonley .
I broke up with boyfriend few weeks ago .
I ca n't even see him because he live in another country .
and also I broke of relationship with friend .
she was my bestfriend .
but she made me unpleasant and rude , I do n't wanna touch with her anymore .
It 's really hard time for me .
however I feel relife ,
I trying to get a job .
I 'm gon na make money and then I 'll go to trevel alone .
china , tibet , nepal , India , Thailand !
I failed get a job few times , but It 's Ok .
I keep trying that .
I hope make new good friends ! !
Today , I have a toothache .
I 'm wondering whether I shold go dental clinic or not .
This is my favorite subject , and so interesting !
The picture you can see in my profile is a package of jigsaw puzzle .
I thought I could finish it in a week or so . . . . . .
But it 's very very difficult ! ! ! ! ! !
Most of pieces are red , so all pieces look alike .
I have n't finished it yet , for your information .
My hobbies are ski and judo .
I have skied since I become junior high school student .
But this cost is very incredible high ! !
On the other hand , judo is a reasonable sport .
I have black belt .
But recently , I 've got no day because I awoke all night long and then slept until the sun
shining right above my head .
This is kind of weird that how hard I try , it 's getting worse and
It 's already eight in the morning and no need to say , I am still keeping my eyes open even
with a breakfast !
I would creep into my bed in a few minute .
Why I choose today education as a subject ?
Maybe because as a kindergarden finishing child 's father I 'm concerned about what my daugther is going to be taught in the next years .
And because I realize now , when it has become my problem , that nowadays education in schools needs to face seveeral challenges to be usefull for the children an for the society .
Of course I 'm not an expert , and sure I 'm going to be unaccurate and subjetive , but I 'm going to talk about how I percieve the situation .
First of all I think we must face the fact that the problems are not going to be solved changing the curriculum if we do n't help the teachers to adapt themselves to it .
We 're going to take a tent , a sleeping bag , and so on with us so that we can sleep in the tent in the mountain .
It 's the first time for me to stay in a tent in a mountain , so it sounds really exciting .
It has an obelisk on its peak .
I hope that I can carry those heavy staffs and enjoy climbing .
I luv travelling and I had never travelled by myself before until I felt it was time 4 me to slip away to get some fresh air outside in April .
I surely know that it is irresponsible to disappear without saying goodbye to dad & mom .
what 's more , I definitely know that I would hurt them , scare them and let them worry about me .
but , at that moment , I just wanna take my ticket , searching some places to calm down and release stress .
Lijiang , a place where I could temporarily forget the pressure , slow down the pace and enjoy myself lounging and taking pics freely and comfortably .
the old town really gave me a shot 2 purify and borden my mind .
I made friends with strangers and now still keep in touch with them .
sometimes I 'd luv 2 review them , reminding me of those faces , the smell of sunshine and my footprints along all the trip .
I 'm learning English in school ( 3 years ) .
3 years ago I was learning German ( 6 years !
And I was the best in the class ) , but now I forgot everything : < I wanna learn Finnish , but It 's very difficult .

Everybody has a decent and dignified stand and resive silently through the sing .

So Im using this site for my English skill to improve .
I think Ill write a blog casualy sometimes .
And im going to post a TOEFL writing essay as well : )
I am embarrased to say that I am not good at English but love to learn English .
Besides that if you want to learn japanese , I am happy to help you ,
Well , let me cut my reduntant introduction hear and make some coments on latest news which drew my attention .
According to japanese TV news , 46000 people return to Japan after spending golden week in foreign country which is a collection of some national holidays .
Due to thread of swine flue , so many people including nurse and airport staff check the traveler .
I saw one of those travelers who returnd from mexico complained hassle in airport .
but he should n't have gone if he complained .
Remember that goverment warned against all non - essential travel in adovance and there are some people working on this case now instead of spending holiday .
Changing My Mind
We finally decided to the date for moving .
We will move to another place to use three days holidays : 21 , 22 and 23 of November .
Therefore , I must pack all stuff in my house alone in twenty days .
It sounds really tough for me . . . . . .
I guess that my daughter sometimes will help me but I do n't expect it .
In addition , if someone helps me , I will get confuse the content of boxes which I do n't pack by myself .
Therefore , I want to pack them alone .
I 'm sure that I must pack over 200 boxes .
Oh my gosh !
In this moving , I will throw away all unnecessary things .
I know that there are bunch of boxes which I have n't opened yet after I moved here .
While I 've lived here , I bought a lot of things again .
I regret that I waste money to buy unnecessary things .
Are you the person who can throw away unnecessary things ?
In my case I 'm stingy and I ca n't throw away them daringly .
And I 've kept a lot of cardboard boxed which have not been opened yet in my house .
I will throw away all such boxes this time .
I want to change my mind and be a good house manager more .
My home is very old , which had been constracted more than 35 years ago .
But I like my home because it is very attractive !
One of the reasons is how kind residents are .
Sometimes they scold him tenderly because of his innocence .
So I can feel that many residents watch my son and I really thank them .
However I have to move few weeks later !
The new home is not so far from here and its equipments are not old .
But I have a confidence that I miss my present sweeet old home in the nearly future .
I moved into Burwood where is located in western suburb of Sydney .
There are many Chinese also no chaging the city , so I could see many Chinese in here .
I just have been to some suburbs - - such as Silverwater , Strathfield , Manly - - so I have not have any informations about that .
However it was more peaceful and playful than things I think .
I entered here as short - term accomondation - - it is similar to backpacker - - so I had to buy my own foods .
Luckily , it was near to Woolworth from my accomondation , so I bought somthing easily .
As a result , I became as the city person .
When I was in South Korea , I lived in the countryside .
Anyway it would take long time to adapt myselfe to new circumtance .
Lastly , I feel so fresh now because the atmosphere of outside is so silent and cool for me .
I drunk too much and I have a headache now .
But I had such a great night because I enjoyed Italian foods and drank lots .
I expected that I would be hammered .
I 've never had a headache during drinking .
I 'm kind of shocked because I feel I 'm a poor drinker .
I 'm absolutely indiscriminate when it comes to music and I can listen everything from pop to classical music .
I 'm just laughing that she is like a man .
I went with her , but just to hang out in Moscow ( I like Metallica only with the symphony orchestra and some ballads as well ) .
This spring she is going to go to Helsinki Finland to see Iron Maiden and she ca n't wait !

I mean I decided to use the paid study hall that my younger brother goes .
At first , I could n't access the internet by wireless LAN at the study hall .
But I have been able to access the internet since I had complained to a janitor of the study hall about that .
Here is quiet and comfortable for studying and working .
I can put distance between me and every temptation and break away from the crowd , if I am in here .
I am able to understand that my brother goes here everyday .
By the way , I think janitor of the study hall have nothing to do all the time .
I envy him and I want to run a study hall one day .
Which is correct ?
Wihch sentence is correct ?

it is when I post a new entry on my blog with language chinese .
Then I also post a new entry on Lang - 8 with language english ,
both of two are same content .
Last Friday it held Athletic Festival in my oldest daughter 's elementary school .
She was enjoying it and showed me excellent scene in her hoot - race .
She was always last position in her members of three .
Both boy and girl in three are the delegate of relay race .
She said that I was always last .
Her mother told her that do n't never give up !
In this race she did n't be first but she won the girl .
She gave us the best smile in the day from her goal .
On Saturday , I went a workshop about Herb .

Every time when I see Jim Parsons or even hear his name , I ca n't help bursting into laugh .
He is a very popular comedian and plays the role of Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory .
I like watching his show for two reasons .
First , seeing his expressions on his face , his movements , is a real relax .
Whatever the mood you are in , he can make you laugh .
Just like Uncle McDonald that is just trying to make you happy .
Second , all his lines are well designed , not just something you forget after the show .
He put his deep thoughts into a humorous way of expression , so you can always find something new and refresh in your remember of his magic smile on the stage .
This is why Jim Parsons always makes me laugh .
I came back home now , I 'm tired today . . .
I had an English class from early morning , and then I had a part time job of Teaching Assistant .

They tried to find the inpiration for thier work from their familiar surroundings .

They enjoyed to paint the people in the world .
Especially , he drew his friends and families a lot .

Dit you ever thought how much you could save money if you have unique knowledge about the airlines which do not have other people ?
Quite by chance I came across on the Internet on humans , the airline employee who knows how to simply pay less . . .
It was a great surprise to me that such knowledge existed !
I decided to check it out and bought his guides .
I must tell you that I 'm still in shock , airlines are doing great business in the ordinary passengers , but not for me !
This guide is a real knowledge and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money on their flights .
Anyway , I 'm here again !

Every summer , some Friench student stay in Shiki , where I live .
Last year my family was a host family and a student stayed for two weeks .
We had really good time with him , so I wanted to invite this year , but my mother said no because she knew she would be busy this summer .
I was sorry that we would n't stay with a student , so I wanted to help in some ways and I asked if I could help .
I expected some job , but she said the number of the students was smaller than usual so they do n't need help .
That was a pity for me because I had been eager to meet and talk with them .
I was single because other guests were not in the restaurant .
After I modfied my first

There were deaths , that 's sad .
Recently earthquakes has caused damages worldwide .
It all makes me think that the end of our age it 's near .
The most devastating earthquake was in 1985 ( 8 . 1 Richter ) , with about 10000 deads .
The Government hid information because they did n't want that people realized the magnitude of the event .
The Government also did it because they were the culprits of a lot of deads caused by the bad planning of buildings .
This year , I have lived three or four seisms - I ca n't rememeber how many , my head is full .
They were of high magnitude , between 5 . 5 and 7 in Richter Scale .
I am worried , probably there will be a great earthquake in Mexico which will destroy the city ( Mexico City ) .
The city is built over a lake system , buildings wo n't resist .
Until when do people restart their life ?
I saw a question in a Japanese website .
`` Until when do people restart their life ? ``
For instance , when you realized your occupation was not suitable for you , what would you do ?
If you are young , probably it 's not so difficult to go back to school and try to become whatever you want .
I found many answers that told it was about 30 years old .
I 'm so sad to see this answer .
30 is still kind fo very young .
I guess it may vary depending on the country they live .
What do you think , old man can restart their life with full of hope ?
If so , how old is a limit ?
Since I already have a driver 's license in Japan , I felt applying for driver 's license here is not so difficult .
Even so , regardless of driver 's license status in overseas , everyone needs to take a paper test and behind - the - wheel test again , so I took a test at DMV .
At first , I went to a nearest DMV , but they turned down my application to driver 's license test since my visa status was still in an applying for extension phase .
Apart from that , since I heard some bad rumor related to the nearest DMV , I went to a second close one from my apartment .
In the second close one , they accepted my application .
I thought I should have been there at the first place .
Because some rules are different from Japan such as it 's legal to turn right on a red light here , so I studied and prepared well for both of tests .
He was strong bald guy with sunglasses and never changed his face expression and nor smiled .
He reminds me Terminator - I hoped he say `` No problem `` .

By accident I was born as a Japanese woman . . .
people can go abroad or communicate on the internet easily than ever .
However , as everyone knows , there still are so many people who are in poor lives . . .
in other words only small part of people can own personal computer and communicate with people all over the world .
And actually , this fact is somewhat quiet strange for me . . .
the difference between rich and poor is mostly based just on in which country they were born !
I was born as a Japanese but if , I had been born in a poor nation , my life would have changed completely .
But I know there is no `` if `` in human life , we ca n't nothing but live our own lives . . .
as someone said `` dont think too much about things that cant be changed . ``
Oh I just ca n't help to fall in love with this fantastic world .
I living in a small island country and it seems not so many people share my enthusiasm about star trek stuff .
The lasted star trek movie is about captain Kirk and Spock .
But it 's tatolly worthy . . . . .
The place I lived is a warm city .
But these days the climate is getting cold rapidly .
Many people prefer warm than cold and I consider myself the most resolute one among them .
In this cold days , I just want to stay at home : home and dry , was there anything better than that ?
Unfortunately , I got cold last night .
Headache , nose cloged and chogh , I hate them ! ! ! !
Maybe I will be healed after a sweety dream .
Today , I went swimming and ate an ice cream after work .
I swam too hard so I was exhausted .
It 's quite fun .
This menko card ' Harm of Building ' is assumed printed in 1930 's .
I can distinguish printed era by qualitiy of paper , printing and themes .
First , it 's very difficut to find menko card printed in multi - color in 1920 's or earlier .
Second , this could n't be in early 1940 's because theme nothing to do with militalies could n't be allowed during WWII .
This could n't be in later 1940 's because quality of paper and printing of this menko card is too good for that era .
Third , the possibiilties printed in 1950 's or later ?
Buildings were not a icon at that time .
Boy loves something special in all the time .
So , I conluded this menko ' Harm of Building ' was printed in 1930 's .
In these days , kid 's ca n't have these kind of ' dystopia ' toys .
That 's the reason I love menko !
It was rainy day .
We put up together an umbrella .

About the time when evening , we went to the ' Shinchon ' .
' Shinchon ' is called as `` street of youth `` .
There are many `` youth `` people .
We was one of them .
We had a dinner .
We ate a food made from flour .
We were full so took a walk .

Today , I would like to talk about my angry to my manager in work place .
I work for export and import company and I have been working in this office for 3 years .
And he has been working here around 13years .
Our company used to have members of 9 people but now we consist of only 3 members .
I am getting notice my manager 's stupidity and he give me a realizing that I ca n't be a such a stupid person when I am a senior in the future .
And I think , We could n't seen his ability before due to it has been covered up to other people .
He likes to shift someone his work responsibility .
He ca n't decide anything and he always need to make the way of his escape from any situation .
He always pretend that I know the everything .
He used to speak the negative position even when we talking about jokes .
I am not great but his attatude is disgustting to work and I just need to talk the place to ease the stress .
Someone told that it will helps to have good english speaking skills when you fight someone .
Congratulations on your graduation !
I changed my clothes to attend a ceremony .
On my way to school , the rain changed into driving snow .
All graduates entered high school assembly hall and they sat down their seats .
The most impressive thing was that girl 's graduate 's message to all students .
Graduate 's parents were listening her story with tears in their eyes .
She said she had belonged to volleyball club .
Finally , they could take part in the volleyball game and they had experienced victories and defeats .
I believe it 's experience was great treasure and she 'll never forget her wonderful memory for rest of her life .
My daughter also got great treasures and memories .
start the Lang - 8

I going language school in U , S , A .

The visa of India
Today I applied to the consulate for a visa of India .
I have been in Changchun serveral days .
I saw an brown adult sanke died beside a big banana field .
Dad told me it had no poison because its head was n't triangle .
That reminded me when I was a kid . . . . .
It has been a long time since I saw snake at the first time .
I still remember when I was a elementary student , I saw a died Umbrella snake [ Bungarus multicinctus , ( Blyth ) ] .
That 's my first time so close to a poisonous snake , althought it already died .
My dad also told me lots of his experiences about snakes .
When he was a kid , he regularly to catch snakes .
If the snake is poisonous , he hit until it is died and play with it for fun .
Or he might catch a sanke without poison , killed and ate it .
He said he caught a non - poisonous snake to school , the snake is really big , and he was caught by his teacher , and the result was he was hit severely by his teacher .
I asked him why he did that ?
He said , he was a kid of never afraid , did everything for fun .
But , he was a man now , and he would never do these things again .
I guess that 's because I learned one thing from this experience .
When people grow up , they will gradually forget their instincts or afraid of trying new things .
rainy season .
In Japan , rainy season finished yesterday .
I often use moter cycle , and rain prevent me to drive .
My English skill is poor , so please whoever contact me , if you can help my English . ( ^ _ ^ ) /

And , DMC has wild fans .
Usually he is really kind and naive guy , but when he is in DMC , he is an evil .
This gap make this anime funny .

And we talked about each other with sitting on bench near by there .
Soon , we went her dormitoty .
I could make more friends because there are many her friends .
And she and I arrived at her room and studied Korean .

Besides her question is so difficult to explain in English .
And we went basement .
Surprisingly , there were a billiard table , computers , sofas , TV and health training machines .
The more we spend time , the more we close each other .
We had a plan to go to Han - River next tueseday .

We had a little snow in this early morning .
There were a little cherry blossoms yet .
My husband wanted to take some pictures for snow and cherry blossom together .

The characters ' personality is from their nationality and customs .

Like in WW1 , England is the enemy of every country .

It 's too difficult to explain for me .

One of my aim of studying English is to have a good command of English poetic expressions .
By the way , I like Tanikawa Shuntaro in Japanese poet .
( I know it already have a good translation but I will do it by myself . )
I 've been learning hula for ten months though I 've never been to Hawaii .
When I joined the lesson first time , it was very tough . . .
Because I have to almost always be in a half - crouching position .
Anyway , I 've been addicted to it and I 've been practicing very hard for the success of the rollout because it will be held on August 312008 .
However , while I was sitting up late , I ate too much .
( I ate two cups of rice and two toasts with choclates .
And I drunk cafe ore . ) And I ate too much for lunch today . . .
I went to ramen shop with my friend , who is 2 years older than me .
And , in Japan , older one often pays for both of two .
Noodle weighted 350g .
It was pretty yammy anyway .
So my stomach has been killed a couple of times in these 2 days .
Perhaps you are looking for Japanese talented architects with over three years of progressive and experience in architecture school .
I am pursuing urban renewal techniques and landscape architectures , and now I interested in the algorithmic design .
My intention and experience provided me broad unique vision for the new architecture field in China .
I graduated from Tokyo University of the Arts with Bachelor degree in architecture and I am studying in Master degree now .
So I possess a strong skill of visual expression .
I was absent from school for one year in 2007 , I instead I worked full - time in the office of Professor Akira Kuryu ( Chiba Univ . ) in one year period .
This experience provided me with valuable abilities of the general building design processes .
Additionally , in the Jun Aoki office , I operated Rhinoceros and have made various progress in different projects such as assembling natural collages , and operating 3D fundamental forms with command in CAD .
I can use technical knowledge with the foundation of skills to quickly adapt to new technologies .
For instance , since I had known the usage of machinery in advance , I taught my colleagues how to use it .
From these work experiences , I realized the importance of the fundamental skills and teamwork are necessary for architecture projects , which helped me a lot for the next job in this field .
I have strong communication skills to collaborate with teams and I am also able to be assertive .
My ability to deliberate about given problems has allowed me to consistently achieve goals .
For instance , at the Professor Kuryu 's office , when we designed the public hall , the government and we researched the opinion of local residents .
I added up these opinions analytically and integrated my proposal into the final report .
This was agreed upon all members and we could accomplish this project with my proposal .
I am certain that my experiences and abilities , which are resulted in my web page , would contribute to your projects .
This weekend , I will go to Niigata for FUJI ROCK FESTIVAL 2010 .
I asked my friend today , if it is possible that I will get a good mark in English speaking examination , because I actually like to speak in English very much and I also enjoy to do so .
However , she was so serious and she said to me , I will never get one of the best mark because I make so many mistakes during the English conversations .
Then , I had to ask for myself , whether it is a good thing to be honest at all because her honest answer hurted me so much , even it is the fact what it is .
I know already lying is not a good thing , however , we sometimes need to lie which is called ' a white lie ' to comfort somebody else .
Being honest is very difficult as well , but she trusted me to say it because she concerns me so much and honestly .
So , I am very grateful that she said to me something honestly , so I can see my problem more objectively .
I write a diary for the first time .
I have been studying English because I want to learn it and to speak many people .
My friends told me this site is good so I write : )
There are several reasons reading books is good .
There are much information in it .
For example , science , literature , grobal , language , and so on .
In addition , you can improve your emotion .

I do n't have the reason . . .
Do you have your facebook account ?

What I was surprised is the directors of the drama are gays even though it 's main characters are all women acting houswives .
I 've thought that must be made by woman directors , anyway it 's awesome .
As considering the stories and mood of desperate housewives , the drama is fit to women .
I 'd like to use better expressions and right words .
Today , I wanna think of studying foreign languages .
Students in public school have been studied English from 7grade in Japan .
( but my korean is not good , still beginner level . )
Most Japanese college let their students study foreign language expect English .
We have to take other languages class . )
I wanted to study Korean at my college but unfortunately my college does n't offer Korean class , so I took French class .
Actually I do n't like study French because I 'm not so interested in France from the outset and I took it against my will because I had to choose one from my college 's offer .
I 'm not fluent all languages but I 'm interested in other languages .
Have you ever had this feeling like me ?
My mom said it 's not good for me and she suggested me I should study other language before I master one .
I agree with my mom indeed , but how do I deal with my desires .
How do you think about this issue ?
If you are okay , please answer my questions .
Probably , almost Japanese students are taught that sometimes `` were `` is used to subjunctive mood .
If I were rich , I could buy whatever I want .
However my teacher told me that almost American do n't use it .
I think that all language is changeable every minute but I 'm confused .
Do you use `` were `` to subjunctive mood ?
I hate examination .
When I was a chird , I was very well it .

I wanted to watch a fantasy like `` Harry Potter `` yesterday , but the movie I watched yesterday was a dark fantasy and it had a little heavy theme .
Today 's movie is really good .

I think all of you have already heard about the Brazilian carnival .
It is the most anticipated holiday here once during four days in February people nationwide are invited to celebrate joy according to their local culture .
They are organized artistic groups that prepare performances to be presented in great parades , and there Brazilians as well as tourists delight in the mesmerizing dance and music .
Whatever choice may be , the carnival is a time to recharge the batteries in order to face the year ahead .
Is it possible to understand other people 's pain ?
I think we can imagine other people 's pain to use our past experience .
For example , we know that it 's painful when a ball hit to my body fastly .
Because we learn that by experiencing that actually .
So when a ball hit other people 's body , I can imagine that painful .
But I can only imagine that .
A ball do n't hit to my body .
A ball hitting other people 's body is not my experience .
So I ca n't understand .
How do you answer to this question ?
It is a garbage collection day this morning .

When I got to my class building , one of my American best friends was crying .
I asked what 's wrong with her , and then she told me that she just got a text from her mom about her grandma passed away .
I did n't know what am I supposed to say to her .
I did n't come up with any words which can make her feel better .
After the class over , I got a call from my Japanese friend .
Her boy friend who started dating only 3 days ago dumped her .
Probably saying nothing and listening her talk were best way to make her feel better .
It is sometimes really hard for me to think of what I should say when my friends are having hard time .
Then I also looked up ' middling ' and could n't really see a difference between the definitions of the two .
I was laughed class mate .
But I decided to choose to action than keep confusing in myself .
Today I went to shopping with my mother and brother .

It has been about 4 months since I did it the last time .
The dentist told me that I do n't have cavities as ever .
I sometimes forget or fail to brush my teeth , but I have had no cavities since I began to go there and get removed my tartar on a regular basis .
The dentist and assistants always managed to find a way of relaxing children .
For example , they put a TV in front of the patient 's chair and play the DVD of ' Tom & Jerry ' while the child is examined .
I 'm afraid that the parents confuse Tom 's shriek with their child 's .
I heard an ambulance siren and the siren stoped it soon .

Do you believe a reincarnation ?
She is one of the person who believe a reincarnation .
It was a white dog and my mother loved it so much .
However , it was 8 years old , it got sick .
She was worried about it and took care of it very hard , but it died .
Of course all of us felt sad and cried , because we loved it so much .
My mother especially felt too sad and she said to the dog 's dead body `` If you will be able to reborn , you should be a human 's baby next time . ``
After 20 years later , I gave birth my daughter and my mother was very glad about that .
And she asked my daughter `` Do you remember this ? ``
When I looked at it , I was too shocked because it was the bowl which our dog had used before .
Of course my daughter was upset and could n't understand what she meant .
Therefore she started to explain about the bowl `` It was the bowl which you were my dog before , I have wanted to meet you as a human being for a long time .
and Do n't you remember that bowl ? ``
My daughter answered `` I do n't remember well .
When she heard my daughter 's answer , she seemed to be disappoint .
When I was in Okinawa , I could see the clouds different .
They looked like raised in the sky .
The sparse raised clouds in the sky amplified the uncanny atmospher with twinkling stars .
It seems like to me that nature was defferent from those of big cities such as Tokyo .
Therefore our eyes were naturally riveted on the indigenous nature .
Even after soaking in the sea , the sunbeam promptly evaporated our soggy wears .
And its original culture enriched harmony between human and nature .
Okinawa has some remote isles aroud it .
And I found myself to look at a carriage towed by a water buffallo at one of the isles .
A man on the carriage was playing a instramental unique to okinawa with singing Okinawa songs .
I have just maken a decision to participate in international exchange .

For example , the number of the heinous crimes like homicides has been increasing and it 's been getting more difficult to get a job recently .
Not to mention , economic crisis is still continuing , which led to many bankruptcies .
There are even several abuses by a parent .
One of the reasons is the fact that more mothers get to go to work now than before .
In the future , I 'm sure human relations will be weaker than now .

But if I lend umbrellas one after another , however many I may have I ca n't have enough .
So you receive visitors and refuse to lend ones . `` And he went into a room .

But the problem is difficult for me !
Now I worry about what I want to do in my future , so I am depressed and concentrate on studying !

Absolutely , college life is a career preparation .
Although there are somebody think that attend to college just finish what their parents hope and get the diploma , I think waste the time in college to play computer and so on is not a smart idea .
Learning and practicing the skill which we need in the future is the most essential things
All of us wanna have a happiness life and a favourite career with high income , so most of us want to attend to college to realize our dream .
Therefore we should grasp every second in the college .

From now on , I decide to remeber some English vocabulary everyday .
I think the vocabulary is the base of English .
I had been studied English at school in Japan since I was in a junior - high school till university , otherwise I ca n't speak English fluently .
It has been said Japanese education 's serious problem for a long time , and it was made by English teachers .
Because most of Japanese school 's English teachers ca n't speak English fluently , so they ca n't teach English like a native speaker .
Of course they has a good skill for teaching , but I think the most important aspect of English education is how to make a communication , because language is tool communication .
Even though Japanese students have been studying English for 6 or 10 years is school , they ca n't make a good relationship between foreigners for the sake of lack of speaking skill .
Japanese government have encouraged to improve English teacher 's training for decade .
The ministry of education have been trying to employ foreigner English teacher instead of Japanese teachers for raise a English education 's quality , otherwise it was hardly function in Japan .

The card said that keep good friendship between us and she hopes I will have a good days .

He graduated from a high school which I graduated from .
In the Southern Kanto , there were only two DPJ statesman who could retain their seats in constituencies , Kan Naoto of Musashino City of Tokyo and Noda Yoshihiko of Funabashi City of Chiba .
This is a reason why he was considered as a new leader of DPJ .
My nearest railway station is located in the border between Funabashi and Narashino Cities .
Many statesman are seen frequently there , and Noda often speaks to voters at the station in mornings .
I always voted for him in elections , but I know nothing about his policies , because he say nothing about them .
He learned politics in a famous university , so he certainly has a lot of policies .
However , he does n't show voters his policies clearly , because policies make enemies .
He eagerly works for voters , but obviously , he does n't like talk about ideological matters .

I went to my English class .
Our company is had a get - together today .
We ate ribs of pork .
It 's delicious .
I am going to sleep .
I start Lang - 8
I Start lang 8 XD
I do n't know what I write to this .
But I trying .
everybody , Please help me when I need .
I wish Winter coming faster . . ^ ^
Last year I started learing snow board .
In my life for first time go to a sking ground .
At the start just ski but time pass 2 hour not interest .
Change snow board really fantastic .
Take a ski learn 1hour just o . k , But snowboard is very very difficult . and very interested .
For the first time I buy equipment .
In this time so hot weather I really miss winter .
Everything become to white .
It was not so common here in Japan to change a job at least 20 years ago .
My first changing was that time .
However , to tell the truth , I easily wanted to escape from difficult problems .
When I face to such problems , I strongly feel that it 's a wasting time to keep on .
I 'm apt to hope the great results would come .
But great achievements are originally not obtained easily .
As anyone 's success is shining brightly , I just can find it .
It 's a simple way , but difficult for me .
When I think it 's impossible to the difficult problem , it might turn out to be true .
I should quit worrying about the great failure and I should keep on doing once if I have started it .
Some hold the view that it is do not need to incrase teacher 's salaries in order to the quality of education , because they firmly believe that the major part of student education is the students themselves .
However , from my every day experience and observation I can state several factors to defend the statement that increase teacher 's salaries can improve the quality of education .
First , a well paid occupation can attract many people to be a teacher , it follows that many people with doctorate willing to be a professor in universities .
It is no doubt that a doctor have more sophisticated eucational skills than a graduate since he have more study and teacher experiences .
For example , my school is just a average college , but it offer the teacher with a high salary .
In this case , the teachers inculding professors and teaching assistants are almost have a or two doctorate .
And thus the quality of education in our university are improve sharply , as well as with a good reputation .
Second , increase the teacher 's salary can imspire them to do their best .
It is the same reason just like any boss increasing a employee 's salary .
The teachers , are the ones that want to keep their salary in a stable stuation , must satisfy their students and the dean .
The need to prepare their course in careful , introduce new and interesting methods to educate students .
In a word , incresing the teacher 's salaries is the best way to improve the quality of education .
Because many qualitied people will want to become teachers with a high salary and imspire them to do best .
I work as PR for baby close company .
I used to lived in FL and LA for foreign student .
For these day , I do n't have chance to speak and write in English , so this will be good opportunity to keep the skill for me .
I hope everyone will see this and correct it .
Most of Japanese domestic Comanies have the five - day workweek system , and the holidays are Saturday and Sunday .
The good point is that everywhere I go is not so many people .
The Bad point , However , is that I have an work on Saturday .
Most of my friends has day offs on Saturday and Sunday ,
If you live in Asian countries , it 'd be easier to trip to Korea than those who does n't live in Asia .
It 's actually been said that trip to Korea is cheaper than domestic one .
If you only want to enjoy nice Korean foods , you not nesesarily have to go to Korea .
Because there 's always been so - called Korean town in Tokyo ! !
I went to Korean town and had really nice Korean BBQ tonite with my colleages which reminded me of visiting Korea for about two years ago !
Yesterday I was too tired and went to bed early .
But because a friend send me a SMS told me he was sick .

Yesterday , I read a Japanese comic book ( MANGA ) the title is `` GAKU `` .
`` GAKU `` is a story of mountain rescue member his name is `` SANPO `` .
`` SANPO `` is a very strong climber who had climbed many famous mountains in the world .
But his most advantage is kindness .
He has never scolded to carelessness climbers .
On the contrary , he said to them `` You did your best .
When you 'll be fine , let come back mountains again ! ``
I argument with my wife because of small differences between us .

It is true hunting whales is japanese tradishion .
Before seeing this movie , I would never feel like that because eating whale is japanese old custom and tradishion like french eat rabbits and flogs , escargos .
Fisherman and their families are thankful for whale .
And they prey for the whale and they have festival for apprecaite to the whale .
It is not easy for everyone to kill the ANY animal for eating , they hunt the whale with hard pain for their life , that is earning money .
They cover the blue seat above the sea not to show killing whales after the movie was broadcasted because they think the scene of die should not be shown like human being does n't show their face to all people when they die .
Fisherman do n't break the any international law .
What right do Sea shepard have to critecize them personally .
They should critesize the hunting to the whale in itself in right way .
They just make fisherman angry by taking photos and videos with persistence and they get the scene fisherman is mad at them .
It is definately unfair .
What do you think about the hunting whale ? ?
In Japan there are not a few cockroach living .

My youngest daughter woke me up and asked taking her down to the living room in the morning .
I wanted to sleep more , but I choose not to sleep again and did some work .
There were many people in there because it 's Higan in Japan .
We ate late lunch at a restaurant near the station .
When we went back home ; I was entering my house , my youngest daughter wanted to play at the garden in front of my house .
Therefore I weeded a garden while she was playing .
It was a ordinary day , but I think I had a good day .
I went to Guns and Roses concert in Tokyo Dome last night .
The sound effect was messed up !
Probably , it is because of the seat area where I was .
I guess the speaker system could not cover up to the area .
In addition to , it was too cold in the venue and so on . . .
Anyway , I was happy to hear famous tunes from the past albums .
Today , I started to belong English school .
It 's style is that students talk to a teacher living in Philippines by skype phone ( IP telephone ) .
It 's cost 5000 yen .
It 's very cheap compared with normal English school .
I can hear the teacher 's voice clearly , but I think it is difficult to understand what a teacher said by only voice .
I worked hard without much success , because the topic was too difficult and complicated to discribe .
The textbook quotes from a lot of papers one after another , so I really confused trying to make sense of the outline .
I could n't be satisfied my presentation , I like drinking after every effort none the less ^ ^
I want to do better work next time .
A huge job hunting event will be held in this weekend at a large convention hall in Tokyo .
So I made reservations for a overnight bus and hotel .

As for hotel , I 'll stay at a hotel which has hot springs .
However , I can stay there with reasonable price .
I 'm looking forward to visit there .
And I hope I 'll be able to get higher motivation through this event .

What is worse is Japanese government is trying to control information in this internet age .
And I knew many people are worrying about it .
I really appreciated that .
But I really want to know what foreign people are thinking about this situation of Japan .
Chinese is so fan .
Japanese also use Kanji , so I think it 's a little easy for Japanese to remember Chinese words .
But it 's difficult to pronounce and to hear .
It takes long time for remembering English words , but I often found out mean of a Chinese word which I do n't know only to see .
Today , after Chinese class , my teacher told me to come to the teacher 's desk .
I thought `` did I something bad . . . ? ``
But he said `` You do study so hard , but your pronunciation is a little incorrect , I 'll teach you . ``

What I had been requested by the client was the following ;
To make it like a bleary picture .
To focus on some parts but not all of it .
Basically I always listen to all the requests from a client and try my best to achieve the goal exactly the way the client imagines on her mind .
However , this time the client was very strict about the whole layout in detail , because they themselves take care of their own clients ' hair style everyday and are naturally keen on how the beauty is supposed to be .
It took us thee months to complete it and we , our designers , coders and I , have just made it and I 've felt very relieved to finish it !
Cherry blossom is surprising . . .

He had got married a year ago .
Of course he introduced her .
We all had a long talk , you know , talking about the past , the present time , and of course , future projects .
Going back to home , I thought she was the perfect wife for Richard , so that he could manage his terrible mood .
Eat at home or Out ?
I think your answers should be like `` Yes , Of course `` .
Certainly , it 's not easy to cook a nice dishes because cooking is a high technique job .
I seldom invite my friends to eat at home because I am not confident in my cooking skill although my friends would not mind of it , or even a clear soup noodles .
Making a delicious food is a high technique job because you need to know what kind of food material , tool , and recipe you need to prepare and how to select , use food material and tool , and do a cooking .
In China , there are thousands of food material and cooking methods .
Even if the material is the same , the taste may be variant from different cooking methods and different chefs .
For example , a fish can be made by frying , steaming , cooking or salting etc .
The supplementary raw material could be any kind of vegetables or even China Traditional Medicines .
So , it is not easy to cook such nice dishes at home , if you invite a friend for a meal , I suggest you go to a restaurant or a chophouse .
For a second consideration of eating out , most Chinese people would like eat out when invite friends or hold celebration activities , such as birthday party , relationship building party .
In these situation , usually , there should be a host to pay the bill in turn at this time , the custom is different from Western 's dutch treat .
For this reason , it would be consider stingy because you will spend less money on eating at home than restaurant , or when your friends invite you in restaurant for a return order next time , you would feel like owing something .
Finally , eating out can be considered convenient and save more time to chat or do other things .
Eating out could be less one third of the time than eating at home , that is , if taking twenty minutes in restaurant would taking one hour at home .
After meal , eating out means no need to do washing dishes and cleaning work .
Especially , when you invite a lot of people for a meal , eating at home would be a very much challenging work .
It was such a huge work that I remembered by now .
Now , in my hometown , many such parties would be held in restaurant for convenience and delicious tastes .
Certainly , there are many reasons to support my view that eating out is more better than eating at home when you inviting friends for a meal .
Very very delicious ! !
But I worry about put on weight . . .
I have to diet . . .
I cut my hair at beauty salon .
I like this my hairstyle .

After class I just took the elevator down to the building with my listening class teacher and two of my classmate .
On of my classmate turned to the teacher to improve our listening skill .
The teacher said that we should listen the meterial over and over and try to figure out all the words and sentences after class .
If we ca n't still figure out some words - especial the technical words - after listening it over and over again , we have to try to write it down and look up in a dictionary .
Most of all , he emphasized that we had better not to read the script from begining to end .
That 's what I learned about today .
I 'm working in a publishing company , and our section publishes monthly wedding information magazine .
Now I join in a project to study about the wedding markets of foreign countries , especially of China .

I must interview some couples who had already held the oversea wedding .
I think their fresh voices are most important hint of my project .
