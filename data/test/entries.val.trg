And he took in my favor ite sub j e c t s like so c c er .
A c t u ally , he was the one who let me know about L an g - 8 . .
H is Ka n j i ability is much better than mi ne .
We ' ve know n each other for only half a year , but his less on s were a l ot of f un .
I heard a sen t ence last night when I was watch ing T V .
When you go down h i ll , you have to st ic k out your ch est or you will f a ll down .
When you go up h i ll , you have to be n d your back .
It is like when you are con f ro n ted with f r ust r ation and you have to keep your con f id ence .
When everything is going s m o o th ly , you have to be more mo d est .
When I was at school , we pai n ted a l ot of w o o d en hand y w or k , like small p l ate s and case s .
M a k ing so u ve n ir s is a hard but interest ing work .
i F in ally my mother took me to the c ust o m s w in d ow , and ga ve a pass p or t to the man . . .
There are two b a ll s : one with a c at inside , the other with do g .
You know , you can ( w in ? ) them at a s l ot machi ne .
The th ir d me m or y is the house where we live d .
It was sit u at ed near He l s in k i , a big and light house with e a small la ke behind it . It was w in ter , so it was f ro z en .
I do n ' t know why .
I like d F in l and in the W in ter .
And I ho pe I ' ll like F in l and in the S um m er .
J ust start im p ro v is ing ! `` To tell the tru th , I myself did n ' t expect
If only I had de n se black c ur tain s .
A co up le of week s a g o , I heard a new W h it ne y H ous t on t un e / so ng on my c ar ra d i o .
I had been wonder ing what she was / has been do ing .
It said that it was dis a p po in ting .
O l d and not beautiful . . . . . ( w w w w w )
I know about her t um ul t u ous mar ri age with B o b b y B r ow n and an ar d u ous b at t le with her dr u g a d d i ction .
she still has n ' t re c o ver ed from them ?
M or e dis a p po in ting to me is she said the reason for her bad voice that day ? was because she talk ed with O p r a h W in f re y too much on her show .
That might be one of the reason s , however , to me it just sound s like an ex c us e .
I would say after 1 0 year s of wait ing , it has not f a il ed it s ti t le , at least not from my first impress ion .
A n y way , I think I ' ll sp en d quite some time play ing it in the next f e w week s .
O K , that ' s all for my first ent ry .
B e f or e , I went to the l i b r ar y .
On the way I got a head a ch e .
So , I think if we have to go some where on f o ot , we must put on our ha t .
If we did n ' t do that and walk ed for long time , we would will co ll a p se or di e .
If my sen t ence s are n ' t p r a c t ical , please c or re c t them .
This morning I found out that one of my f a v o ur ite b and s re le as ed a new al b um .
I already for g ot about R is e A g a in st and it is a great surprise for me , because I have n ' t listen ed to them for 2 year s .
I ho pe this b and did n ' t become w or se , like many other s big one s did , and I ' ll enjoy listen ing to it .
Well , I just have to get it and c he c k it out .
It ' s because my m um is probab ly the be st c ook I have ever me t in my life .
C ook ing is not her pro f es s ion ; but rather , she is a house w if e .
I have eat en at hotel s and have had ex p en s ive me al s but they are nothing like what she c ook s .
I would rather be work ing outside than be a house w if e .
I think it ' s been about one and half year s now .
I should have ex p l o d ed the who le bu il d ing so I can de st ro y ~ them ! ! !
I had to write about co un se ling .
This is my first time writing a di ar y on the in ter ne t .
I ho pe some on e will see my di ar y and c or re c t it .
I watch ed a D V D of `` G re y ' s an at o m y `` to day .
A c t u ally I watch it a l ot the se days .
So there is a l ot to see .
I do n ' t know all the me d ical w or d s in English .
But I can study English with it .
And I think it ' s f un , right ? ( Y E A H ! )
I ' m eat ing a b an an a every day for my he al th .
B an an as give s me en er g y .
I have to make a new s p a p er in English as my s um m er va c ation home w or k and I de c id ed to in t ro d u ce about my do g in the new s p a p er .
I will in t ro d u ce my do g , T i ar a .
She is a c he er ful and p l um p pretty do g , per ha p s she is the c ut est do g in the world .
She ' s an 8 year old go l d en re t ri ever
He r f ur is a beautiful am b er co l o ur and is so f t .
She is a little st up id , but has per c ept ive in s i g h t s about f o o d because she is always f a m ish ed ^ ^ She l o ve s f o o d !
When she is b as k ing she look s very con t ent .
However , I ho p ed it would ra in to day because it is too hot .
I saw a new s ar t ic le on Ya h o o yesterday .
It re p or ted that C h i en - M ing W an g c ut his ha ir and has a new ha ir style .
He re is the l in k :
It talk ed about there being a big di f f er ence about different va l u es of a hand s ome man between We s ter n co un t ri es and E aster n co un t ri es .
It me n tion ed many ex amp le s of J a p an e se me n , K or e an me n , and H on g K on g me n .
They pai d much at ten tion to their face s and sp ent l ot s of money to sh op .
But in We s ter n co un t ri es , the stand ar d of a hand s ome man depend s not on their face s , but on their ma s c u line s y m b o l s , like m us c le and be ha v i or .
I started to not ic e the way s of for e i g n c l o th ing and ha ir style s the se past days by watch ing T V pro g r a m s , such as F ri en d s , S c r u b s , e t c .
If they had a long ha ir , it would be re ally long and th ic k .
B y con t r a st , me n in e aster n co un t ri es dress up more .
A p ar t from a shirt and j e an s , we usual ly we ar an access or y .
As to ha ir , me n usual ly have me d i um ha ir , neither very short or long .
If we want to c ut our ha ir short , we must leave some ha ir on the back of ne c k in or d er to a v o id look ing like a n er d .
It almost co st me a who le morning .
I have to watch the N B A ' s f in al game 3 .
I like you give me any commen t s and opinion s too .
I would re ally like to dis c us s .
My so n has di ar r he a
When I came back home from work to day , my so n had di ar r he a .
It was like water and his bo t t o m was re d .
We were p l an n ing to go to my home t ow n tomorrow .
We were all read y to go .
But we had to c ance l the tri p .
But there ' s no way we can go .
I am listen ing to m us ic on the co m m ut er train .
To day , I listen the m us ic , it feel s like I am in a c a f e .
I like the w ar m sea s on .
So , I like sp r ing .
S p r ing is a very ex c it ing sea s on .
In J a p an , the new school and work year start s in sp r ing .
I ho pe to become qu al if i ed in English .
I ho pe to get a new pro m o tion .
E ver y day , there are new things to try .
. . . No , very f re qu ent ly .
S t ar ting to day , I ' m going to try write a di ar y every day ! !
To day has nothing sp e c al to write ! !
It ' s a kind of T a i - w an style ma s s age .
I l o v ed the ma s s age sh op where I went because the s ta f f of the sh op explain ed what is wrong in my body .
A fter that , I went to a f it ness c l u b which has be d r ock bath ing .
I felt re la x ed to take a be d r ock bath ^ ^
I went to S en d a i as a business tri p to day .
The sp e c i al pro d u c t of S en d a i is a co w ' s to n gue .
I b ough t it and at e it at home .
I want to eat this co w ' s to n gue again .
My d aught er / She was w o k en up by my w if e .
The w if e was w o k en up by my s ter t or / s n or ing .
Where to hold it and when we should leave has not been de c id ed yet !
So , even now I feel n er v ous , wonder ing if it ' s re ally going to be he l d .
And I want to live my life at my own p a ce .
B e c a us e when I ' ve finish ed my class es , home w or k or job s e t c . . .
It ' s near ly 1 0 p m when I get back home .
It ' s near ly 1 2 p m .
I ' ve been s u f f er ing many un ha p p y things the se days .
M a y b e things are n ' t so bad own their own , but I re ally c a n ' t hand le them when they o c c ur to g e ther . . . .
I do n ' t know how to m aster this language . . .
T h ough I sp en d most of my time and en er g y in le ar n ing English , it ' s become a p p ar ent that I ' ve hard ly made any im p ro ve ment .
I do n ' t know why it ' s so hard for me to le ar n English ! ! !
our teacher said something to me that made my heart b re a k . .
I had never know n my English was poor unti l the teacher told me that my English sound ed i ll o g ical . . . .
S um m er H o l i day
I had a long b re a k time .
I should study again .
I got up at 6 : 3 0 a m in J a p an .
He ll o ! N ic e to me e t you ! My name is A il s a .
I ho pe to make many friend s on la ng - 8 .
T h an k you every on e !
E le ction s will be he l d on A u g ust 3 0 th .
The M a y er is s up p or ting H a m ad a for the mi n is ter of de f en se .

This time they may los e a d m in is t r ation .
The D e m o c r at ic P ar ty has more s up p or ter s than they do .
The M a y er is bu s y with the e le ction c amp a i g n as well as his own work .
I ' m going to help ing him with his work as his se c re ta ry .
I went to a Ka n a z a w a U n ive r s ity f est i v al with my A m er ic an friend .
I made a good friend with a V i e t n ame se .
We enjoy ed it very much .
And we had dinner with my other friend s .
. To day was an am a z ing day .
It is made of sp on g e : ) It is c ut e .
I receiv ed an accept ance letter and s ch o l ar s h i p from the B er k le e C o ll e g e of M us ic .
I ' ll ent er / go to B er k le e in the f a ll se m est er this year .
However I have two w or ri es .
One of them is that my English is still very c l um s y .
A no ther is the high - p ri c ed t u i tion fee s .
A n y way , I ' m study ing English at the T O E F L In st it ut e the se days .
B er k le e do n ' t require s a T O E F L s c or e .
I have a l ot of as s i g n ment s every day .
It ' s very difficult to do all of them , but I always try to make my be st effort .
I ' m le ar n ing English , but it ' s re ally difficult for me !
S ever al days a g o , I had an ir re g ul ar heart b e at for the first time in my life !
It was like this ; I s ud d en ly started to feel some so r t of of dis c o m f or t around my heart .
I was very s c ar ed because I had been very he al th y so far .
I ' m still in my 2 0 ' s .
D o I have to live with it for the re st of my life ? ``
The do c t or told me that I did o c c as ion ally have an ir re g ul ar p ul se but it was not a f at al one .
He a d d ed that it could get w or se d u e to str es s and f at i gue , and he just a d v is ed me to take as much re st as need ed .
I was re l i e v ed to he ar the do c t or ' s di a g no s is , but I ' m still w or ri ed .
I think that may be a co m m on question for those students who want to p ur s u e high er education .
What C h in e se un ive r s it ies off er their students is most ly course w or k b as ed c ur ri c ul um .
I ' ve s um m ed up some point s which I think are im p or t ant and us e ful .
You can co un t on G o o g le as your be st friend , a d v is er and an almost in f in ite re s o ur ce of a c ad e m ic paper s .
M an y of them you can down l o ad as a p d f copy , or if you c a n ' t down l o ad a paper from the l in k s s ch o l ar . go o g le . co m off er s you , go direct ly to the a u th or ' s we b s ite , many a u th or s enjoy their paper to be see n and cited by read er s .
A good re v i e w is the be st start ing point .
And then you can tra ce the a u th or , or the paper cited , to do a more in de p th re se ar ch into your are a of interest .
The c or re c t b al ance of w id th and de p th of your read ing is es s ent i al .
B o th way s have their me ri t s and dis ad v ant age s .
In no v at ive and original idea s are good , but if you can not find them , you should know that most of re se ar ch work is just re f in e ment of other ' s work .
I ' ll sp en d the next f e w week s / the coming week s on board the `` J ust o S i er r a `` ve s s el c ar ry ing out some g e op h y s ical re se ar ch and le ar n ing .
The bad thing is , I have n ' t le ar n ed the ve s s el ' s part s in English yet .
The thing that I want to do in J an u ar y 2 0 0 9 is to put in more effort in study ing English and keep on writing sen t ence s in English every day here in L an g - 8 !
However there were not so many people there , so we did n ' t need to wait our turn outside .
I think that M an g a is the great est for m of ent er tain ment in J a p an e se c ul ture .
My favor ite write r s are N a o k i U r as a w a ( The M on s ter , 2 0 th C ent ur y B o y , e t c . ) and H i ro y a O ku ( G ant z ) .
B y the way , I found some we b sit es with a hu g e am o un t of M an g a tra n s la ted into English .
( I think they are no do u b t il le g al . )
It ' s a new ex pe ri ence and very education al for le ar n ing English .
But I think that there are a l ot of difficult express ion s in English M an g a .
D i a g no s ed with being easily impress ed .
I re al i z ed that I ' m the kind of person who is easily impress ed .
I ' m mo v ed by very simple things that other people might not even have a second look at .
F or in st ance , I started watch ing some In d i an mo v ies about a month a g o .
When I had the time , though , I b ough t about six In d i an mo v ies to watch .
The first mo v i e I watch ed made me c ry for two hour s like a five - year - old who los t her do ll .
A c t u ally all In d i an mo v ies have the same b as ic idea .
However , I con t in u ed c ry ing d ur ing the re st of the five f il m s and each one of them impress ed me even more .
In d i an mo v ies are like c la y that can be mo l d ed into many different sha pe s while still re m a in ing c la y .
This conc ept might be a b it am b i g u ous for those who have n ' t been in such a sit u ation .
I took some me d ic in e , so I feel better for now .
`` 4 5 0 time s ``
This is my 4 5 0 th di ar y .
I started keep ing a di ar y around 2 0 0 8 .
T h an k s to the people all over the world , I ' m having a f un and so l id time .
C ha ng ing the sub j e c t , but I got a call from my friend yesterday .
I was somewhat p u z z led what to say .
He ll o ! My name is K en .
I just started study ing English .
However , it is ter ri b ly difficult .
The no ve l is about an im p or t ant R o man po l it ic an called / name d G a i us M ar i us .
He is the ma in character , al th ough other s like C or n el i us S il la , M e t el us , and C a es ar ' s gr and f a ther also appear .
M ar i us did n ' t come from an im p or t ant family , but he became a con s ul because he was a c l ever and p op ul ar g en er al in the R o man ar m y .
So , after he was made con s ul by the R o man s , he went to A f ri c a , where he f ough t against Y u g ur ta , who was k ing of N um id i a .
M ar i us w on the w ar in two year s , and when he went back to R ome he was made con s ul again for five year s .
M ar i us had to fight other tri b es in the no r th of I ta ly , unti l 1 0 0 B .
He had to s te p down from p ow er because he got sick .
I l o ve study ing .
B y the way , do you like to study ?
I ' ve just receiv ed an in ter n ation al call on my ce ll p h on e .
I was wonder ing if it was from one of my friend s .
But it was from K or e a ' s qu ar ant in e de po t ,
We do n ' t have the se s y m p t o m s right now .
If it help s , this picture is the i nformation they ga ve us at J a p an ' s qu ar ant in e de po t when we return ed to J a p an .
is any on e free ?
let s ha ng out in to k y o ~ ha ha ~ x D
im free unti l next month .
c u z I don have a school unti l then ! !
I do n ' t like it .
A l th ough most people think about what ha p p i ness is like , most people never do u b t that there is ha p p i ness some where in a hu man ' s life .
A f a m ous man , I heard , said in the past that the w or st thing for you is to be b or n in the world .
This is just my n ic k n ame .
I st ud i ed at a un ive r s ity in Tokyo .
I receiv ed a b a ch el or ' s de g re e in a p p l i ed p h y s ic s and electronic s .
I change d job s a f e w time s but always kept the same ty pe of job as an e ng in e er .
I c ur r ent ly work for an electronic s make r in J a p an as an e ng in e er .
My p ar ent s , brother , and s is ter live in Tokyo .
F u ku o k a is l o c at ed the no r ther n part of K y us h u ,
which is a part of the J a p an e se A r ch i pe la g o .
C o m p ar ed with Tokyo , F u ku o k a is a comp a c t but very co m f or t able c ity .
C o m m o d ity p ri ce s here are l ow er than those in Tokyo , and F u ku o k a A ir p or t is very near c ent r al F u ku o k a .
N ar it a A ir p or t is far from c ent r al Tokyo .
M or e o ver , Tokyo is a very c r ow d ed c ity .
One thing I do not like about living here is that I ' m se p ar at ed from my family .
It co st s a l ot of money to go see my p ar ent s from here .
A n English less on for H a ll ow e en
I ' m an e le ment ar y school teacher , as you might know .
In J a p an , start ing next year we will off ic i ally have to tea ch English to 5 th and 6 th gra d er s .
I have already made some English class es for the ch il d re n .
The to p ic of the less on was H a ll ow e en .
We provide d act i v it ies to get the students not only to keep enjoy ing the less on , but also to keep some v o c a b ul ar y in mind before they le ar n it .
One of them is `` H a ll ow e en T ri v i a and B ing o `` .
The students need to answer question s about H a ll ow e en that I ' ve p re p ar ed by play ing B ing o .
The more answer s they get c or re c t , the more B ing o they can play .
A fter the class , I asked the students to f i ll out a question n a i re .
I was very glad to find [ that ] they like d the less on .
One of my ul t im ate go al s as an English teacher is that all students look at the world b ro ad ly .
I ' m sure you ' ll have p l ent y of op p or t un it ies not only to co m m un ic ate with people from other co un t ri es , but also to le ar n about s ever al c ul t ur al di f f er ence s through the less on .
I believe this will le ad them to accept ing more cha ll e ng es .
That ' s why I ' m very ex cited to tea ch students English ! !
It is It ' s been c l o ud y or and ra in y re c ent ly .
A l th ough my school was no le c ture does n ' t have a le c ture , I got up e ar ly in the morning to day .
It co st six do ll ar s to was h ing for the la un d ry and co st six do ll ar s to for the dr y er .
When I was h ing end ed , it was even ing . L a un d ry end ed ti ll even ing .
I went to the c a ke sh op in the c ity that my friend in t ro d u c ed to has been tell ing me and it has a as n ic e ta s te and f a m ous .
The sh op of in n er de c or at ing de c or s was gr e en .
A fter I came went back home , I c ook ed dinner , and the f o o d for dinner was were p r a w n s & a v o c ad o s al ad , ro a st ch ic k en and O T A M A S A N G O H A N .
F ir st , I c ut the let t u ce , c ut co ar se ly a the to m at o co ar se ly and then s ta ir - f ly f ry some p r a w n s .
The O T A M A S A N G O H A N is J a p an e se on ly tra d i tion al f o o d .
It only sp r in k le s the ra w e g g and a p in ch d ash of the so y so ur ce on w ar m ri ce .
They were easy to c ook ing but they ta st ed n ic e ! !
A fter that I watch ed two mo v ies , an im ation of g en i us bo y and 0 0 7 , on T V for a p p ro x im ate ly four hour s .
I a p p re c i ate you teaching English to my d aught er .
I was look ing for an English class around here .
We thought about just tak ing a tri al less on , but she told me that she want ed to go to the less on again .
I am very surprise d about her pro g re s s .
No w she is very interest ed in speak ing English , writing the al p ha b e t ( w or d s ) and s ing ing W H A T ' S Y O U R N A M E ?
We ow e her pro g re s s to you
It will be a b a se when she go es to a new school .
If I did n ' t need to take care of my kid s , I would want to take your less on s !
It is very easy to come with kid s because it is c le an , s a f e , just a 1 - hour time di f f er ence and close to the H an ed a a ir p or t .
A fter , un ive r s ity class es , I went direct ly back home , p re p ar ed pack age s and sea r ch ed what time I should leave home and which train s I should take .
And if the tea m w in s 8 game s , the tea m will get first position .
But / However the re m a in d er of it s game s is 9 game s .
There f or e it is difficult for it to get first position .
The start ing p it ch er was not good , there f or e the op po s i tion got 3 point s easily .
We c he er ed very hard , but the mi r a c le never happen ed .
T h o se are such things as play ing sp or t s , read ing b ook s , listen ing to m us ic , tak ing walk s .
My favor ite ho b b y is talk ing with my friend s , because I think it is the be st time to be with my friend s .
I ga in ed about 1 0 k il o g r a m s after I qu it my c l u b s in high school .
That ' s why I have to los e some we i g h t ! ! !
So , I always j o g and ex er c is e . (
I w an n a have a six - pack ! ! ha ha
This week en d , there are three ho l i day s in J a p an .
They are on S at ur day , S un day and M on day .
M on day is E qu in o x D a y .
It will gradua l ly become w ar m .
J a p an e se are wait ing for ch er ry b l o s s o m s in this sea s on .
Yes ter day was the same .
But N e x t week I will go on business tri p s .
To m or r ow I do n ' t have much work .
I will go to the l i b r ar y and to the c a f e to study electronic s after that .
My friend star r ed in the play .
She and I became friend s when we were j un i or high school students .
O ur friend s h i p s has last ed for more than 1 0 year s .
I saw her act for the first time to day .
To day is a J a p an e se N ation al ho l i day .
So I took a three - day week en d .
S in ce it was ra in y yesterday and to day , My family and I could n ' t enjoy it .
C h il d re n were play ing game s for a very long time .
And re al i z ed how language s can help you know more people .
R e ad ing English make me feel very ha p p y .
I was impress ed with my life there very much .
I only told them in English
that it would be good if I could speak
It might be b or ing .
and re m e m b er ing Ka n j i that I like ^ _ ^
J a p an e se f o o d is a v a il able at every corner in T ha il and .
I think / believe b ir d s of a f e a ther f l ock to g e ther .
The other day , I me t one of my class m ate from high school at a st ation , for the first time in f if te en year s .
I ' m an English teacher .
On the other hand , she tea ch es c or re c t walk ing and po s ture .
We made small talk / had a short con ver s ation there and left .
When I started to walk , I had an ur g e of want ing to talk with her more !
So I called out to her and stop p ed her .
We ex change d our con ta c t in f o and de c id ed to me e t again very soon .
We me t once more two week s a g o , I felt strange / no st al g ic then because we had n ' t me t each other for many year s , but still we had many things ( that we want ed ) to tell each other .
P l ent y of things to talk about , but there was n ' t s u f f ic i ent time .
We should n ' t so r t people into le ve l s / ty pe s / c ate g or ies and I believe we are ( all ) living on the same le ve l ( same c ate g or y , same world ) .
I do n ' t like watch ing a s c re en when it ' s too close so I k il led time read ing something .
To day , I read `` The C at ch er in the R y e `` as a s um m er home w or k as s i g n ment .

2 1 . 1 2 . 2 0 1 2 * * * I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent .
H i , I ' ve started L an g - 8 .
I want to le ar n English and find friend s here .
C an we become friend s ?
I live d in L on d on from 2 0 0 5 to 2 0 0 8 ,
But I c a n ' t speak English . . . ( ; _ ; )
So please tea ch me English ! !
I gradua te from un ive r s ity in 2 0 1 2 .
so I want to ex change i nformation about my job around the world .
I called for a refund for the P ar k Y on g - ha conc er t ti c ke t s .
I heard that they sen d money by re g is ter ed ma il by A u g ust 1 3 th .
C ul ture of sh ame
F or e i g n me d i a a d m ir es how J a p an e se people are be h aving c al m ly , or g an is ed and in a s up p or ting manner .
But it ' s co m m on for us J a p an e se .
We think that ma k ing trouble for other s is a very bad and sh ame ful thing .
E ver y p ar ent want s their ch il d re n not to trouble other s .
In the past , J a p an e se gr e w ri ce which was need ed to help other s in the co m m un ity .
It would be great if you c or re c t my mistake s .
T h an k s a . l ot .
I did n ' t know why I lie d , but at that time I b l an k ed out .
It was about a job I s ough t from the new s paper .
A l th ough I know a p ri v ate school st ud ent like me in S ing a po re is st ic t ly pro h i b it to go to have a job .
I am still going to the place to try my l u c k .
When my a un t i e asked me what kind of pass I he l d .
But for me I am more f o c us ed on le ar n ing the ex pe ri ence through work ing and co m m un ic at ing with other s .
B y the way , the job is re ally a short - ter m job ( se ll er ) , which only last s for two week s .
To day I saw a mo v i e called T w i light .
But some of them made me feel dis g ust ed .
E d w ar d is c ut e , he care d about B el la .
And B el la is a strong girl .
Yes ter day , J a p an ' s n ation al so c c er tea m play ed against A ust r al i a .
It was the f in al ma t ch of the As i an C up 2 0 1 1 .
F ive days a g o , J a p an play ed 1 2 0 minute s , includ ing ex t r a time , against So u th K or e a , further m or e , the a ver age he i g h t of the A ust r al i an tea m is ta ll er than J a p an .
So I thought most of the J a p an e se me m b er s would be tired and the game would be very hard for them .
The game went into ex t r a time t w ic e in a r ow in the se m i - f in al game for J a p an .
However , at 1 1 0 minute s , L e e , who came off the be n ch , got the go al !
I ' m very glad that J a p an w on !
D o you like s ing ing ?
I like to s ing very much .
To day , I went to the k ar a o ke bo x with my so n and ne i g h b or s .
I s an g so many so ng s and re l i e v ed my str es s .
My favor ite k ar a o ke so ng s are by S e i k o M at s ud a .
He r so ng s are easy to s ing to , know n by many people , and they also have good r h y th m s .
I had a re la x ing time .
To day I might f a ll as le e p soon .
L on g a g o , my father got a g u it ar .
h He ' s still the own er .
I do n ' t know but I of ten us e it more than him .
I ' ll do my be st !
It is the sea s on of ch er ry tree s in J a p an right now .
He re are some reason why we l o ve them .
The time from b l o o m to f al ling is very e ar ly .
It is like a hu man life . ( t ate m a e ! )
It is a l ot of f un to dr in k while see ing them .
I had a head a ch e , was tired , and had no a p pe t ite .
I s l ept all day unti l I had to work .
The day before yesterday , I hung around with one of my C h in e se friend s .
We went to J I N M A O O B S ER V A T O R Y 8 8 .
It was a rather high bu il d ing .
D o you know me ?
I am a her o .
But I am also a ro b ot who is hand led by a re m o te con t ro l .
F or t un ate ly , I am a her o of just ic e .
So I am called , `` The He ro of J ust ic e . ``
My name is `` T e t u z in 2 8 go `` , which mean s `` ir on man No . 2 8 `` .
If the re m o te con t ro l is take n by an e v il person ,
I am tru ly a her o of just ic e though .
Where am I ?
H in t : In J a p an .
O k in a w a is in the so u ther n m o st part of J a p an so it was hot there .
We enjoy ed s n or ke ling !
We went to the be a ch which is an de s er t is l and near N a ha .
I felt like I was in dr e a m because the sea was so beautiful and there was a l ot of fish .
And we went to O k in a w a P re f e c t ur al P e a ce M e m or i al M us e um .
I think that the w ar should never of happen ed .
To day was my ch in e se friend ' s b ir th day .
She is a 2 6 year - old woman who works for a tra ve l a g en c y .
In addition , she is p ur s u ing a mo d el ing care er in J a p an .
We me t at a night c l u b in Tokyo .
O ur dr e a m s are different , but I think we are similar in that we both want to p ur s u e our own dr e a m s .
I wonder what I should give her as a present , so could you give me some a d v ic e ?
F or e i g n b a b y
I can me e t for e i g n er s if I go to the c ity are a in Tokyo , but I w o n ' t be able to me e t a for e i g n b a b y .
It ' s only a d ul t or ch il d re n that I me e t .
I like b a b ies so I ' m always look ing for w ar d to me e t a for e i g n b a b y
He has been living in J a p an for 1 0 year s and he like s to talk with J a p an e se people .
I think our language s k i ll s were even .
He want s his b a b y to speak J a p an e se so he ' s le ar n ing J a p an e se every day .
R e c ent ly , I ' m f as c in at ed with a T V s er ies name d `` How I me t your mother . `` ( T h ough I do n ' t watch it on T V but the In ter ne t because is has n ' t been in t ro d u c ed into T a i w an .
He always make s his own the or y about life !
To day , since people turn out to be more and more r ation al and have high er de m and s about the op po s ite se x , along with an open mind about da ting which has n ur ture d to n s of different re al ity da ting show s .
This show f e a ture s `` P ar ent s da ting G u y s `` .
The pro ce s s is like this , the girl ' s p ar ent s will me e t the guy s first , then they will make the de c is ion for their own d aught er s who , by the way , is not even on the scene about whether they should give this guy a ch ance to go out for a d ate with their d aught er s or not .
I do n ' t understand why so many people are into this stuff , I de c id ed to ar r an g e some n ic e d ate s for my friend s by follow ing my own style .
A d ate that can ex ud e both part ies ' w ar m th and cha ri s m a .
S ound s a little b it trick y ?
With o ut a ud i ence s , l o ve j ud g es , p ar ent s , just a friend ly and p ri v ate at m o s p he re , which all ow s them to be themselves and enjoy the moment .
L a st night was the second d ate ( that ) I ar r an g ed for my friend and ho pe ful ly they can work things out !
play ing the two ro le s
I ' m a e m p l o y e e on a week day and a st ud ent at gradua te school for the three days in a week .
I en ro ll ed the school in A p ri l .
H ar d work is require d some time s , but o b tain ing a new know led g e is n ic e .
I am cha ll e ng ing a ta s k that I have not ever done in the business .
This is also very va l u able to me .
With o ut f a il when there ' s great need , great heart s and mind s ri se up to me e t the cha ll e ng e .
In two month s , my p rofessor will take some students to O h i o un ive r s ity in A m er ic a for a month .
But who m ever want s to go there , must pass the ex a m and in ter v i e w .
G o ing a b ro ad is my dr e a m , so I re ally ch er ish this op p or t un ity .
It is a good ch ance to str e ng th en my know led g e , b ro ad en my ho ri z on , enjoy for e i g n c ust o m s , and also re al i z e my dr e a m .
With o ut any mean s to im p ro ve my poor English I can try speak ing more , listen ing more , read ing more , and so on .
In my opinion , it is a difficult pro ce s s to over c ome myself , but I must insist on do ing my be st , no matter how difficult it is .
On ce you make up your mind , per s ever e in do ing it .
I was s up ri s ed when I found it . I have been study ing English for 2 year s because I want to make a l ot of friend s all over the world .
Yes ter day , K it a j im a K ous u ke who is a b re a st str o ke s w im m er , got the go l d me d al .
He is small er than most people but he did it .
I was very impress ed .
They are i ll um in at ed d ur ing the night .
The to p of the mo un tain was very co l d , even though I was we ar ing s n ow b o ar d g e ar .
I ho pe I do n ' t catch a co l d . : )
W ish ing You H a p p i ness In P ar ad is e
I just listen ed to his b and B o y z on e ' s b ri ll i ant so ng `` No M at ter What `` on the way back home .
S te p h en was c ut e and bra ve but now he is go ne .
When I was in j un i or high school everything seemed b or ing and mean ing less , and I also did poor ly in my st ud ies .
One day , I f a il ed a ne x a m .
A t that time I had no place to go ; my p ar ent s ha ted w h en I under a ch i e v ed but s ud d en ly a f a ir - sound ing voice f l o at ed to my e ar . ' I c a n ' t de n y what I believe , I c a n ' t be what I ' m not . ' I was as t on ish ed by the voice and ly ri c s which c he er ed me up .
You r l o ve ly face looked like a ra y of ho pe .
I wish you ha p p i ness in p ar ad is e .
With know ing come s c ar ing , and with c ar ing there is ho pe that we could make way for a he al th y en v ir on ment that s us tain s us .
[ In depend ent paragraph ] O il has been f l o o d ing the g ul f of M e x ic o for three month s .
[ In depend ent paragraph ] There has been only 1 5 days without w ar since the begin n ing of hu man ity , which mean s an un c o un t able number of people have been k il led and been k il ling at the same time .
[ In depend ent paragraph ] On the other side of the g l o b e , a great number of people live on less than a do ll ar .
C le ar ly , the world is l op s id ed .
W at ch ing C N N and read ing The N e w Y or k T im es , I am s ud d en ly wonder ing how many of us believe we know what ' s going on outside our own little world .
I ' m bu il d ing comp ut er pro g r a m al g or i th m s even when I am dr e a m ing at night , because I ' ve been do ing comp ut er pro g r a m s all day long .
It was n ' t the c or re c t al g or i th m , I am try ing to make a block p u z z le .
The pro g r a m will be p il ing block s up or so r ting them or do ing something else .
F or 1 0 month s , I st ud i ed J a v a and J a p an e se .
It was particular ly difficult to study J a p an e se .
A c t u ally / H on est ly , I wonder ed `` can I do this ? ``
Some time s , I felt f r ust r at ed and de s p a ir ed .
N e x t We d ne s day , the e c on o m ic s se m in ar so f t b a ll ma t ch will take place .
However , the ex pe ri ence of v o ll e y b a ll does not transfer well in so f t b a ll because the for m is different
A n y way , I ' m re ally look ing for w ar d to play the game ! !
I must to read litera ture , which is written in English .
So , I am start ing to le ar n English for the first time in a de c ad e .
I am an a ud it or of a con st r u ction comp an y .
To day the J a p an e se con st r u ction in d ust ry face s a serious c ri s is .
When some on e as k s me , `` What ' s your favor ite thing ? ``
I ' ll respon d , `` My ho b b y is read ing b ook s , ``
In fact , most people , when asked about their ho b b y ,
they would n ' t usual ly answer that they `` l o ve to read b ook s `` .
and ma g a z in es ,
than k s for read ing and f i x ing my wrong sen t ence s , ,
To day was a bu s y day .
I have been work ing no n - stop .
I have to work from 9 : 0 0 a . m . to 1 0 : 0 0 p . m .
You get to ex pe ri ence a l ot of things , like how to us e different kind s of p en s , and me e t a l ot of people , even if they are not always very kind . *
O ur b re a k time is too short .
O h , how wonder ful the co ll e g e life is !
On ce you get into the so c i e ty , your life w on ' ' t be as simple as that in co ll e g e .
A fter each tea m sub m it s it s propos al , there ' s a week for people to v o te for their f a o u v or ite on the we b .
There ' s a f in al p ri z e for the three high est s c or ing tea m s at the end of the con t est . They all can en ro ll for free in a po st g r ad u ate course ( or a language one , if they have n ' t finish ed their de g re e ) .

But we still ho pe we w in in the end and visit U S A ! !
I went to Tokyo D is ne y R es or t on F e b r u ar y 8 th and 9 th with my bo y f ri en d .
On the first day , we went to Tokyo D is ne y S e a .

You know , the e ar th qu a ke affect ed my family very bad ly .
But my gr and m a is s a f e .
And my c ous in s are also fine .
I p r a y for them to return to normal life ! ]
C a n ' t I say `` f ri ed potatoes `` ? You can .
In the gra m m ar ex er c is es , which I did for hour s ( ? ) I could n ' t c or re c t any sen t ence s ( ? ) .
B e c a us e it is very im p or t ant ; I ' ll never get a good job without it , and I ' ll never understand half of the beautiful sit es in the In ter ne t !
And I like to draw in P h ot o s h op and I ll ust r at or , and many other things !
Some body , who is le ar n ing Russian , and all who want to talk with a Russian girl - let s talk by s k y pe !
To day all of my class m ate s and I went to the H u an g R ive r P ar k .
The H u an g ri ver is the second long est ri ver of C h in a .
As it s name im p l ies , the water is very y e ll ow c ar ry ing l ot s so il .
I re g re t ted we ar ing new c l o th es , when I came back they were full of d ust .
The ri ver is very long . I c a n ' t see the end , and the water is pe a ce ful .
He is c r a w ling every where as his in st in c t tell s .
When he get s s il ence , it is a da ng er ous sign to me .
I put my f ing er s into his little mouth , and p u ll it out .
I tri ed to keep an e y e on him while do ing house work ,
E ver y day he is gr ow ing little by little , s te p by s te p ,
and every day I am le ar n ing how to de al with his can - do things .
S p r ing V a c ation is A l m o st He re !
It ' s been a long time since I w ro te a di ar y ent ry .
My un ive r s ity class es started on J an u ar y 8 th , but they will be over short ly .
T im e f l ies !
When sp r ing va c ation come s , I will have to study English hard er , and I ' d like to write a di ar y ent ry every day .
I would be so ha p p y if you would commen t on my di ar y .
But I s l ept in l ate this morning !
I ' m a b s o l ut e ly get ting up e ar ly ! !
A c t u ally , there are not only three so l u tion s in the ar t ic le , but I just p ic k ed out three so l u tion s .
This will re s ul t in a ra p id ly a g ing so c i e ty with f e w er ch il d re n .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to see ing them !
My life is cha ng ing in N Y .
F or ex amp le , to day I or d er ed some c l o th es on line ( you do n ' t say `` in ter ne t sh op `` ) .
I felt ha p p y !
When I us ed to live in S e o ul I us ed to sh op on line .
There are many pro d u c t s that are c he a p er on line than in re ta il st or es .
A fter I left S e o ul , I stop p ed sh op p ing on line .
I could n ' t believe the cha r g ing me th o d .
It was much e as i er than the K or e an me th o d .
I just need credit c ar d number s , that ' s it !
I was w or ri ed that some body would take my credit c ar d number .
F in ally , I found the off ic i al we b s ite . ( F or what ? )
It made me feel more co m f or t able and s a f e to bu y there .
There is no A & F st or e in K or e a , so people se ll this bra n d .
And is very ex p en s ive ! !
B e c a us e of this ex pe ri ence , I could n ' t stop sh op p ing on A & F we b s ite .
I or d er ed some c l o th es and they are going to sh i p p ed on F E B .
I ' m a little dis a p po in ted with the sh i p p ing sp e ed but it does n ' t matter because I ' m re ally sat is f i ed with the p ri ce s and the de s i g n s .
I ho pe it ar r ive s soon !
My very first di ar y ent ry on L an g - 8
On the first day of 2 0 1 0 , like every other year , I made a new year s re s o l u tion .
B ur this year is a little b it different than the previous year s .
I am p l an n ing to mo ve to a for e i g n comp an y , which mean s my ability to speak and write English should im p ro ve .
So I de c id ed to write an English di ar y as a way to im p ro ve my e ng l ish .
And l u c k i ly , I found T H I S S I T E ! !
I believe that writing an English di ar y will re ally help to im p ro ve my English s k i ll s .
T y p h o on is coming
A big strong ty p h o on is head ed to w ar d s the middle are a of J a p an .
R i g h t now it s ra in ing he a v i ly and a strong w in d is blow ing here , so I close d all sh ut ter s to pro te c t the w in d ow s and re d u ce the no is e .
I ' m a little w or ri ed about whether I ' l ll be able to co m m ut e to my office tomorrow morning or not .
M or e o ver , I should at ten d her feel ing s more once more .
The sit u ation made me re al i z e the im p or t ant things .
F ir st ex pe ri ence
My e le ve n month old so n stood by himself for the first time to day !
However , he started to c ry hard after w ar d .
He must have been s c ar ed that he was stand ing without any help .
My English is very bad .
I do n ' t know any gra m m ar and I ' m afraid to speak English .
In fact , I want to say so many things , but writing in English is very ti r ing .
He ll o ! I ' m sorry to write my di ar y l ate ; (
To day , I s l ept for only two hour s .
So I felt sleep y all day .
Why I stay ed up l ate , because I watch ed l ad ies so c c er game ! The game was between J a p an called `` N ad es h i k o J a p an `` and A m er ic a .
The first half of the game was a draw and the second half of the game was a draw .
The over time game was a draw too ! I was very str a in ed by P K ! I ' m afraid of watch ing P K .
F in ally , J a p an w on the game , so `` N ad es h i k o J a p an `` is to p tea m in the world ! ! I was ex cited , so I could n ' t sleep ; ) But I do n ' t re g re t watch ing so c c er .
I want to play some sp or t s ! T h an k you very much : )
I de c id ed that I will write a di ar y every day at la ng - 8 about da ir y thing to le ar n English .
To day , I took a walk around my house by b ic y c le .
I visit ed a F re e m ar ke t which was he l d at p ar k .
The sound s of ( people ' s ) f o ot s te p s / F o ot s te p s
Yes , I am sp e c if ic ally re f er r ing to my bo s s .
I than k my sh ar p e ar s for ( the s a ke of ) my s ur v i v al unti l now .
So many M M A fight er s think they want to be strong er than they are .
This is the most im p or t ant thing to them but , my opinion is different .
Even if they are strong , they do n ' t w in some time s .
M M A is a sp or t that should n ' t be though of as a re g ul ar sp or t .
There are a fight er s who do n ' t think M M A is a sp or t and when they los e fight s , they see m like they want to k i ll their op p on ent . It go es to show a strong person can los e to a we a k person .
I want to say , there is no future in M M A for just the strong .
F ed or , who is Russian , is not very strong .
Y e t he is name d the one of the be st fight er s in the world .
3 : 2 5 a . m . J S T
It is 3 : 2 5 a . m . J a p an S t and ar d T im e ( J S T ) .
To day , I went to un ive r s ity .
In English class there was a t est : (
I want ed to more study .

U s u ally it is hung under the ro o f , but I could n ' t do it .
E ver y on e who j o in ed this class was very good .
Even a middle - a g ed man was better than me !
I am a begin n er .
I made a l ot of mistake s .
H is t or ic ally / in the past * , I am a well p l an n ed person so there are always s ch ed ul es that keep me from do ing anything sp on ta ne ous .
So to speak , there are certain things I have to do almost every day before the s un set s , such as read ing a b ook , watch ing new s , and writing something .
I ro n ic ally , I found myself ha ng ing out with my friend who came here in the e ar ly morning , tak ing a who le day from me . We did st up id things like k il ling f l ies , ma k ing me think of what is more im p or t ant than that .
I am very str es s ed right now .
It was very difficult to say anything so I us ed the wrong w or d s .
so , I spoke English in c or re c t ly .
It was the kind er g ar ten le ve l ~ ~ . .
When I talk , I for g e t what to say .
My gra m m er was wrong too .
I y could only say `` I like ~ I want . . ``
On ly very simple things .
I felt very tired .
They ' re very l o ve ly .
It look s like j e w el ry .

I did n ' t like to le ar n English in school two year s a g o .
But , I came to like English because I began think ing by myself .
L an g - 8 is good place for le ar n ing language s , and it give s us enjoy ment .
I ' m able to keep at it .
E s pe c i ally , in the comp an y , there are many re l ation s .
I want to know how people co m m un ic ate with each other in for e i g n co un t ri es .
It does n ' t mean I ' m not do ing well .
I think I c aught a co l d : - (

I c ar ry it every where , and show it to my friend s .
I de c id ed that I ' d man age it care ful ly to not b re a k it .
Some time s , When I get back from co ll e g e , I feel that I can do a b s o l ut e ly nothing but watch a mo v i e .
I feel so ex ha ust ed but I can not sleep because If I s l ept then when I w a ke up , I ' d have to start study ing again or go to co ll e g e .
E p it ome of C o o l
He re is the end ing .

I am going to mo ve out to S a it a m a ( in the Ka n t o are a ) from where I c ur r ent ly live just because I study at the un ive r s ity in S a it a m a .
I ' m very w or ri ed about the ra d i ation .
We do n ' t know when the sit u ation will re c o ver per f e c t ly .
The w or st thing in the world is sit ting in a room with only your p en and watch ing the time go away
P r a y for me : D : D
R e ad ing B ook s in the B a th
My favor ite time is when I read b ook s while tak ing a bath !
I usual ly take a bath for more than half an hour .
I think read ing about other s ' l o ve affair s does n ' t make any sen se for me .
I like the st or ies that are un e x pe c ted / s ur p ri s ing , like a ro ll er - co aster .
I expect ed an e ar th qu a ke would o c c ur while I was was h ing my face in the morning .
I ' m so n er v ous about e ar th qu a ke s .
I p re p ar ed an e m er g en c y b a g in case .
And I have to f i x my f ur n i ture s to p re v ent from s l i p p ing .
It was very n ic e .
We walk ed around the ga r d en , we saw the an im al s and different s tree s ; we had a small l un ch
I like ma k ing a p l an , but I c a n ' t follow my p l an .
I think I ' m a la z y person , so I ten d to ch o o se an easy way out .
I want to do many things in one day .
On the other hand , I think I sp en d too many hour s us ing the comp ut er .
It is f un indeed , but it is a was te of time for me .
If I stop c he c k ing sit es so of ten , I think I can s a ve more time .
I need to re c on s id er how I us e / man age my time .
T h ough I ' m not good at man a g ing my time at all , I want to try to be good at it .
I will make a good s ch ed ul e which I will follow .
I want to have strong er mind to keep my s ch ed ul e , and I want to con t ro l my time , not let time con t ro l me .
H i every on e it ' s been a while since I w ro te my last di ar y here .
On F ri day I was S c re a m and on S at ur day I was a b l on d ha ir ed girl .
It re m in d ed me of a high school f est i v al .
What I found through c l u b ing as a girl is that some guy s are so dis g ust ing ! !
E s pe c i ally one guy who tri ed to dance with me was so dis g ust ing ! !
He was get ting too close and to u ch ing my as s with his le g even though I ' m a man .
The c l u b had some small st age s and I was da n c ing on it then a guy came to dance with me .
A fter 5 or 1 0 minute s of da n c ing , at last he not ic ed that I was a man .
He was like ' O M G ! ! ' n he l d his head .
A n y way I enjoy ed it a l ot ! !
I was ted too much time watch ing You t u b e .
I watch ed without any re al de s i re to watch .
P o l it ical one s of ten are full of ch il d ish s w e ar ing .
I was interest ed in how they explain the b ook which I read f e w year s a g o ( in J a p an e se ) only the begin ing and ga ve up .
The se over s i g h t s are some time s ma s s ive .
`` E x i le `` is the one of the most f a m ous v o c al gr o up s in J a p an .
But to day , I ' ll in t ro d u ce to you a very ra re un it `` O k a x i le `` .
And he le ad s the dance in this so ng .

This You t u b e v id e o has such a good s y m p h on y of m us ic and such good im age s .
B y the way , _ what can I say when something is very good ?
I im a g in e only `` co o l `` or `` a w es ome `` or `` do pe `` .
P le se tell me if there are any other of ten - us ed w or d s that mean `` very good . ``

I was re ally re ally c a ut i ous at tra n s la ting this because it ' s a n ation al
this is just an ex c us e .
A n y way I did my be st and finish ed .
K e e p ing a di ar y is difficult for me .
I want to keep a di ar y every day , but it is not a simple thing for me .
I think my English ability is poor , so than k you very much for your a d v ic e .
It was a mar g he ri ta p i z z a .
I like c he e z e and a b as il .
I want to eat it again some day .
We sat in out d o or sea t s .
To day , it is hot and the s un is sh in ing
So , I got s un b ur n ed a little .
I feel s um m er will come soon in J a p an .
I like w in ter more than s um m er .
So , I ho pe that s um m er will pass quick ly .
S t r an g e J a p an e se c ust o m s ?
A n interest ing T V show a ir ed last S at ur day .
One of them is dr in k ing al ch o le al c o h o l outside , because most co un t ri es do n ' t see m to all ow this .
It is not a s m ar t be ha v i or in J a p an either , but we have a big f us s once a year outside .
D ur ing that sea s on , no one pay s much at ten tion even we are dr un k , and make no is e .
The next moment we rather become friend s with other gr o up s that are enjoy ing themselves around us .
In J a p an , there are strange c ust o m s as me n tion ed a b o ve , like ha n a m i .
D ur ing ha n a m i , we have to find a place before start ing .
It see m s to be high est p ri or ity .
So , when ever I pass by , I am sure they must be new e m p l o y e es .
To day , my country is ra in ing .
It was very hot and dr y .
U n f or t un ate ly , we have to finish ter m ex a m in ation s .
I can not come on here for around 2 week s .
If a t est is over , I will come again .
He has work ed as a c ust ome r s er v ic e re p re s ent at ive about in s ur ance .
So he will try to study something in that time .
But he has no idea what he should study .
A t the moment , the J a p an e se e c on o m y is bad
We are conc er n ed about los ing our job s .
If he los es his c ur r ent job , he would n ' t know what to do .
No w , the W i i is at my house .
The re c ent T V game is am a z ing .
It is very con ve n i ent that it s c or d less .
B y the way , do you know ' L u c k y T a x i ' ?
Yes ter day , I took a tax i , the dr ive r give me a c ar d . ( picture )
It was a somewhat ha p p y day .
A re the se sen t ence s c or re c t ?
C h il d re n c ry to get / at t r a c t their mother ' s at ten tion
To day , I had a l ot of free time .
So , I thought about what I would do .
Then , I re m e m b er ed a very im p or t ant thing .
That my room was very me s s y , because I ' v been bu s y re c ent ly .
So , I work ed very hard to c le an my room .
I was re ally tired after w ar d s .
T `` it was a cha ll e ng ing time .
It ' s easy for me to study .
I do n ' t like s c i ence as well .
I went back home .
I then went to the p ar k .
I enjoy ed play ing so c c er and b a se b a ll with my friend s .
It may ra in at any moment .
P le a se l en d me a p en to write with .
I ' m no long er s up ri s ed about that sit u ation .
A ll I want to know is the reason why they could n ' t come to my c al s s .
I asked some on e about the reason why they were not here .
He ex p l an ed the reason in S w a h il i , so I was n ' t able to understand , but I re al i z ed that they were being p un ish ed .
D o you re m e m b er my j o ur n al ent ry that I w ro te 2 days a g o ?
To day ' s class is the same class which I was n ' t able to tea ch them because of C H O T A M A J I .
T an z an i an students are different from K or e an students .
When I was in K or e a , if we s k i p p ed the class because of other affair s , they seemed very ha p p y .
However , in here , my students do n ' t want to s k i p the class .
When ever I have a class at night ( act u ally , some time s we have an ex t r a class at night like to day ) , I was sat is f i ed with my students who listen ed de v o ur ing every w or d .
So I have to di g out my first M P 3 ( 1 G B ) out from my draw er .
Well , it c a n ' t sat is f y me .
And I f e ll in l o ve with the l i b r ar y at our school ! ! !
I always stay there for a long time
B y the way , listen ing to m us ic there is also a good ch o ic e ~ ( ha , ha )
D o you take n a p s ?
I us ed to lie down on the so f a after eat ing .
R e c ent ly I read a b ook about di g es tion .
A ccord ing to the b ook , tak ing a n a p is not good for di g es tion .
It say s that even if we are sleep y after l un ch , we should not sleep .
If we get very sleep y , we should go for a walk to for g e t about our sleep i ness .
F in ally I de c id ed to try it .
A fter l un ch to day , I brought the b ook to the so f a and began to read it .
But two hour s la ter I found I had been sleep ing for that time .
A fter all that , I went to sleep to day too .
I wonder if I will be able to stay up tomorrow .
My s is ter took entrance ex a m s a f e w days a g o , and she ' s wait ing for her re s ul t s .
My brother will take it this F ri day .
My s is ter is at a un ive r s ity , my brother is in high school .
F ir st , I can see some mo ve ment s of people s who have re c o ver ed from the da m age now .
When the e ar th qu a ke had happen ed , the e c on o m ic act i v ity was strong ly de p re s s ed .
We thought that it was not good to have sat is f i ed days when people in the da m age d are a have s u f f er ed .
A l th ough that , we have already re al i z ed that the s ta g n ant e c on o m y was even w or st for the re c o ver y of the To h o ku are a .
F or in st ance , the us age s of the are a con ta m in at ed by the n u c le ar en er g y are now dis c us s ed on the J a p an e se new s p a p er s f re qu ent ly .
I ho pe J a p an will re c o ver from this sit u ation and re p ly on other co un t ri es for their help s in the future .
J a p an ' s en er g y po l ic y
B e c a us e of the great big e ar th qu a ke on M ar ch 1 1 th , J a p an e se en er g y po l ic ies have change d dr a st ic ally .
M an y people claim that `` We should not us e n u c le ar p ow er p l ant s ! ! ``
It ' s tru e that ra d i ation im p a c t s people , ve g e t able s , so il , a ir and the sea .
However , I do n ' t think that n u c le ar p ow er p l ant s should be stop p ed im m ed i ate ly .
If we c a n ' t us e e le c t ri c ity to the full ex t ent , e le c t ri c ity fee s will in c re a se and some c or p or ation s might de c id e to mo ve their fact or ies to a for e i g n country .
If that happen s , J a p an ' s e m p l o y ment ra te will face great difficult y .
M o st J a p an e se people c a n ' t speak English .
So if we los e our e m p l o y er s , we c a n ' t get job s !
A fter that , we can change our e le c t ri c ity so ur ce into a natural one .
We should n ' t change our en er g y po l ic y if we c a n ' t do it s a f e ly .
This is like the thing which J a p an e se w ive s of ten say : `` W h i ch is more im p or t ant ? M e or your work ? ! `` .
It ' s the same kind of question .
She always answer s in c or re c t ly at the same question s that I had t aught s ever al time s , like a ne g at ive number m ul t i p l i ed by a ne g at ive number is a po s it ive number .
She just c as u ally answered the question s and so r t of appeared im p at i ent , which made me so r t of a ng ry .
Y e t , I have re f le c ted on my be ha v i or back home .
I had heard of it before but I ' ve never play ed it and neither had any one over there .
A fter play ing be er po ng , many people play ed with it but a funny thing happen ed on that day .
T w o guy s were comp e ting against each other , ra c ing in an a th l etic game .
N e i ther of them knew how ex a c t ly to run in the game .
One of the guy tri ed to run by l if ting up his k ne es a l ot and the other s did not .
A c t u ally , it require s l if ting up their k ne es high enough to make the K in e c t sen s or to sen se their mo ve , so he was c or re c t and had f a st est sp e ed in the ra ce .
However , the pro ble m is he was a b it too serious so he started mo v ing to w ar d the T V mo n it or little by little , then f in ally he s l i p p ed on a floor and f e ll down .
As a re s ul t , s ud d en ly he became 7 th in the ra ce which is the second from last .
So , the ra ce turn ed out re ally funny since one guy f e ll down and the other guy ra n at a s l ow p a ce .
They end ed up get ting 7 th and 8 th .
E ver y on e started laugh ing and I was feel ing like it was a do c u ment ar y of a ra ce with a guy who did n ' t give up even though he f e ll down in a middle of the ra ce and a guy who kept run n ing s l ow ly but never ga ve up .
B e care ful run n ing even though it ' s a game .
^ ^ It see m s like nothing , but it b r ing s very re al ha p p i ness to me .
A t the same time , I want to le ar n how to say no g ent ly because I want to have much ha p p i er moment s other than sleep ing in the morning !
I ' m their el d er s is ter .
I do n ' t know what g if t s my p ar ent s p re p ar ed .
In the even ing we will have a little b ar b e c u e .
And of course , some of our friend s will be here with their kid s .
U W stand s for U n ive r s ity of W ash ing t on , which is l o c at ed in a beautiful c ity name d S e at t le .
B e f or e I went to school this morning , I sp ent one hour j o g g ing around a big la ke called G re en L a ke near my ne i g h b or h o o d .
I went to b a ll o on le c ture r as an as s is t ant at `` O M O CHA O U K O K U `` .
The ma in le c ture r was `` D O I S A N `` from `` M A G I C P O T `` .
A l th ough to day was a ra in y day , many people part ic i p at ed in the b a ll o on le c ture .
A l m o st all of the a ud i ence was comp ri s ed of f a m il ies .
It was difficult to le c ture to small ch il d re n .
I M is s You In L on el i ness
We live in the world for reason s , some of us live only to live with their p ar ent s and so on .
I am not one of them , but I mi s s some on e with my heart and so ul when I feel l on e ly .
The first one who come s to my mind is my gr and m a .
My mother co m m it ted s u ic id e when I was only one year old , and since my father work ed far far away in a town , I was brought up by my G r and m a .
As a ch il d , being n aught y , I brought about a l ot trouble to G r and m a , some time s I even b ro ke her heart .
E ver y time I go home , she always say s : `` O h , my so n !
You are so th in , more than ever ! `` And then she make s great f o o d for me .
That ' s my G r and m a , in who se heart , I am always a ch il d .
Then I think of my father .
When I was about 7 year s old , I went to a p ri m ar y school in town and live d with my father in his school .
G r and m a made me hu man and F a ther made me a person .
He always en c o ur age s me saying that I am the be st so n in the world , if only I can per s ever e , I can a ch i e ve what ever I want .
While I was 1 6 , I did a l ot of bad things , but they never a b and on ed me .
So here I want to tell you how much I l o ve them .
There are far less to ur is t s on that is l and than S a i p an or G u a m .
There is no sh op p ing ma ll , no d ut y free st or es but there are a l ot of natural place s there .
You may feel b or ed if you like mo d er n c it ies but I l o ve it there .
A c t u ally I have been there e le ve n time s !
I think the o ce an of R ot a is the most beautiful in the world .
The l o c al s are very friend ly and are quick to make friend s .
E ver y time I come to R ot a , they always say `` we l c ome back ! `` .
They invite me to their B B Q s , p ic n ic s and to their hu n ting tri p s ! !
This time , they took me c o c on ut c r a b hu n ting .
It was a re ally ex c it ing ex pe ri ence .
C o c on ut c r a b s are act ive at night so we went to a co c on ut for est at night .
They eat co c on ut s , so it ' s f la v or is similar to that of a co c on ut .
There is a big di f f er ence between what is idea l and re al is t ic .
Some time s , you will have to accept something hard or b it ter in your life .
I ' ve never ex pe ri ence d life this hard before .
I will try to make the ga p between my idea l and re al is t ic life short , but it ' s not going well l ate ly even a little b it .
The only person who can change your s el f is you .
I am Y u u .
I ' m just begin n ing L an g - 8 .
My ha ir is not black .
because , I co l or it : )
I will have str e ng th en ed m us c le s for sp r ing va c ation
To day ' s we a ther was ra in y .
I went to the g y m in N e y a g a w a c ity so that I can str e ng th en my m us c le s .
M a y b e , I do n ' t have as much m us c le as the a ver age man .
So I want to str e ng th en my m us c le s .
L at er around 5 p m , I went to work at L ow s on , which is a con ve n i ence st or e .
W or k was easy to day , because of the ra in .
That is to say , when it is ra in y people are re l u c t ant to go out .
I was up se t last night , so I went out for some fresh a ir .
My bo y f ri en d of ten con d e m n ed s me for being against him .
So I try not to op po se his suggest ion s , but I felt it is us e less .
No matter how much of an effort I make , he never change s his mind .
This made me hu r t , so I went for a walk for a while but he te x t - me s s age d me ' You do n ' t have to come back !
T u es day , J an u ar y 4 , 2 0 1 1
I made f o l d ed e g g make care ful ly .
My s is ter made eggs .
So , I comp le ted the eggs .
F in ish ed as mo m came in the house .
M o m b at ted an e y el id .
So we all at e , and it was de l ic i ous .
I ' m bad at re m e m b er ing .
I went to a re st a ur ant with my friend from s w im m ing school last F ri day .
A t first we s w a m in class , and after that , we went out .
We could n ' t de c id e where we should go , but the co a ch re c o m m en d ed me a good re st a ur ant .
The re st a ur ant is near my friend ' s house .
I asked her if she knew it .
She answered `` I do n ' t know it ! `` So we looked for it and we easily found it .
She said , `` I did know it !
You and I came here once before ! ``
`` You brought me to this re st a ur ant ! `` , I re m e m b er ed .
I am st up id , but my friend is too !
And people see m as if they were con st i p at ed ( this w or d is funny because in S p an ish `` con st i p ad o `` is `` co l d `` , and it ' s easy to mistake the mean ing x D ) .
But I ' ve been ha p p y , and I ' ve see n a teacher that was ha p p y too .
In other new s : I ' ve finish ed my s c ul p ture !
However , if I do n ' t get enough sleep , I feel de p re s s ed .
On S un day , there were no act i v it ies and no p l an s .
It was suppose d to be a good time to sleep long er .
I ' ve been wonder ing why I want to study English .
I will ar r an g e my thought in English and write down here as soon as possible .
I have a feel ing that is different from other s .
But I suppose every body has a reason why they want to study a second language .
I think every body has a different reason .
I feel ha p p y that I ' ve got my answer .
I want to study hard to pro ve my answer .
To day ' s work has end ed .
In ( ? ? ? ) , my s um m er ho l i day started to day .
I have take n a week off .
What a ha p p y person am I : - )
I ' ll go on a tri p to K y us h u J a p an next mo n day .
I c a n ' t wait unti l M on day ! ! !
I re m e m b er that when I was ch il d , I could not sleep at night before an ex c ur s ion .
My father was once a D J in a c l u b d ur ing his you th , so he got many L P re c or d s and C D s .
I could come into con ta c t with a l ot of m us ic , from B i ll b o ar d to C la s s ic s , because of it .
A c t u ally , I was tru ly the b less ed one .
As you may or may not know , my father ' s g en er ation was a b s o l ut e ly poor .
E ver y th ing was comp le te ly de st ro y ed , includ ing m us ic .
But there were U S A r m ed F or ce s in K or e a , and they ra d i o b ro ad c a st their B i ll b o ar d so ng s .
My father listen ed to those so ng s from the ra d i o every day and re c or d ed them ( which is il le g al the se days . . . ) and dr e ame d of his future .
Even though he could n ' t eat his f i ll , he was ha p p y f il ling with m us ic .
He sp ent all of his money to bu y the re c or d s or a g u it ar ( or g u it ar s ) .
A n y way s , I got his b l o o d in my ve in s , and I ' m re ally into the m us ic also .
B o th e m o tion ally and physical ly .
T h o se re c or d s he b ough t d ur ing his you th are now re al va l u able stuff : )
My English s k i ll is not very good .
H i , this is the first sen t ence I write here on la ng 8 .
I ' ve been think ing about what kind of to p ic would be good , and then I ' m writing the se r and o m sen t ence s .
B e f or e I went to L on d on , I almost could n ' t speak English . And my English is w or se than an a ver age for a J a p an e se .
But I had the op p or t un ity to im p ro ve my English while I was in L on d on .
I know my read ing and writing is not so good yet , and this is the one of the reason s why I de c id ed to write this sen t ence as well .
A n y way , I would a p p re c i ate it if you would read this letter .
To day is a good day , and I ' m go n n a go to S t ar b u c k s to get a co f f e e or something .
What W o ul d You D o If You were S t re s s ed O ut ?
The se days , I ' m str es s ed out because of work .
T h ough I like to be ha ve a p p ro p ri at le y , it ' s not easy to take con t ro l over my sen s it ive person al ity .
The se days I ' m easily p is s ed off regard ing ti n y things .
If I keep going , before long , I might be know n as a p ic k y woman among st co ll e a gue s .
A n y way , I made a l is t of way s to re d u ce str es s . You can see them be l ow .
E at ing sweet s .
P la y ing m us ical in st r u ment s .
H aving con ver s ation s with friend s and family
The e as ies t way is eat ing sweet s .
But I ' m afraid I ' ll ga in we i g h t .
It would be s ad if I got ch u b b y because of being str es s ed .
If I had no sweet s d ur ing hard work , I would s u f f er from st o m a ch a ch e because the more str es s I have , the more ga st ri c a c id my st o m a ch c re ate s .
I do n ' t know which is w or se . G a in ing we i g h t or having an a ch ing st o m a ch .
It ' s a catch - 2 2 sit u ation for me .
S pe a k ing of f al ling as le e p , it ' s the be st way for me to re d u ce the str es s .
N ever th e less , it is not a p p ro p ri ate to sleep because of time con st r a in t s .
I de s p er at le y need to find other way s to re d u ce str es s .
I ' m want to he ar about it .
L a st month , I receiv ed an old la p t op comp ut er from my mother , because she b ough t a new comp ut er .
So I in st al led a new O S called `` U b un t u `` , which is a L in u x dis t ri b u tion and free . It does see m al ot f aster than the for m er op er at ing s y s te m .
The P C run n ing U b un t u is run n ing as well as any new P C .
I am writing this ent ry on it while listen ing to m us ic .
M a y b e , M ic ro s o f t will have a pro ble m in the future ?
I ' m going to tra n s l ate my b l o g
I de c id ed to tra n s l ate my tra ve l b l o g into English .
F ir st I will im p ro ve my English s k i ll s , and second ly I ' ll have a b l o g in English
B e c a us e in the past people of ten asked me if I have a b l o g .
I re p l i ed , `` Yes I have one , but in Russian `` . So I think it ' s time to c re ate an English ver s ion .
I am a co ll e g e st ud ent .
I live in C h on g q ing .
To day is a sp e c i al day .
D r u g s ' name ' s are difficult to pro no un ce .
U s u ally , can a n at ive English speak er pro no un ce difficult dr u g name s
F or in st ance , when you saw an ar t ic le in to day ' s new s p a p er about a dr u g ,
C an you pro no un ce it at first g l ance without con s ul ting a di ction ar y or we b s ite , e t c . ?
B y ch ance , can you pro no un ce them c or re c t ly only by re c o g n i z ing the al p ha b e t ?
In the case of J a p an e se , we can not pro no un ce some Ka n j i .
My so n left for A ust r al i a last night .
I did n ' t know whether he ' s w or ri ed about it or is look ing for w ar d to it , but I ho pe that it will be a sp e c i al and wonder ful ex pe ri ence for him .
I p r a c t ic e writing st or ies with some w or d s and p h r as es that I st ud i ed to day .
I w ro te a story , to day .
I w o n ' t accept this .
When I went to school to day ,
O ur teacher was a ng ry because re c ent ly many people were b r ing ing things like ch o c o l ate s , or their ce ll p h on es to class .
But I never b r ing the se things .
So I am in no c ent .
But my teacher said `` If you find a person with anything like ch o c o l ate s or a ce ll p h on e , you are respon s i ble for w ar n ing the person .
If you turn a b l in d e y e to it , then you are also respon s i ble . ``
But I was un c on v in c ed , because I think that those people will not listen to a w ar n ing any way .
I am always we ar ing my p ed ome ter .
E ver y day , I look for w ar d to re c or d ing the dis t ance I have walk ed .
My w if e was h ed it without know ing the p ed ome ter was in the pocket .
P re v i ous ly she was h ed the i P O D I a c c id ent ally left in my pocket , after that it did n ' t work any m or e .
My w if e said `` You are wrong for le aving something in the pocket . ``
I said `` You are bad to was h my c l o th es without c he c k ing the pocket s first . ``
I will take an English ex a m on J un e 1 2 th .
This ex a m in ation ' s name is `` E I K E N . ``
E I K E N is a p op ul ar English ex a m for J a p an e se people .
I think that the E I K E N ex a m is made by J a p an e se people for comp ul s or y education students .
O f course , usual a d ul t s are also able to take the ex a m .
However , E I K E N has been somewhat re p la c ed by T O E I C .
The T O E I C ex a m in ation is probab ly the stand ar d English ex a m in ation all over the world .
I feel T O E I C is more difficult than E I K E N .
And then , I will take the E I K E N ex a m .
I just c a n ' t stop s ne e z ing to day because of ha y f ever . ( + _ + ) I take me d ic in e every morning , but it does n ' t work the se days . |
To day , I ra n about 5 k m along the ri ver .
J o g g ing make s me feel very co m f or t able .
A ccord ing to bra in s c i ence , J o g g ing raise s s er ot on in le ve l s .
L a st S un day , I went to Ka m a k ur a .
It ' s f a m ous for A j is a i ( h y d r an g e a f l ow er s ) .
In J un e , many A j is a i come into b l o o m in Ka m a k ur a .
M an y people visit there .
W al k ing in Ka m a k ur a is enjoy able because of it ' s good at m o s p he re .
I went to a P i an o comp e t i tion with my ho st family .
The old er ho st brother got second p ri z e !
I think that that comp e t i tion was big .
It ' s the S p r ing dr i z z le . I do n ' t mind to get so a k ed through . . . ?
I heard some on e on T V said `` It ' s the S p r ing dr i z z le . I do n ' t mind to get so a k ed through `` .
I have a mar a th on to run to day .
I do n ' t like run n ing in the ra in very much for sure .
That is why I said so as a b o ve .
U m m , o k a y , o k a y , It is just a S p r ing dr i z z le , I will run so a k ing through it !
Then , I b ough t a not e P C at B i g C ame r a .
So , I w ro te this di ar y w h it it ! !
It was very di f f ic ul e t when I tri ed to set up this P C .
I will p r a c t ic e with it !
Even though I say it myself ( what ? ) , I ' m us ing some so a p s that do n ' t con tain c he m ical sub st ance s .
I heard that some de ter g ent s can be ha r m ful l when they are dr a in ed into the ri ver or o ce an , re n d er ing l o c al people un able to a v o id some da ng er s from the po ll u tion .
F ro m the look s of it , e c o - conc i ous might be the watch w or d from year s to come . ( What ? )
Yes ter day even ing I had in s o m n i a . My mind is a me s s and full of all things !
In or d er to dr in k , I finish ed my work e ar ly .
I dr an k with my co - work er s after a long . time .
But , one of them was on leave . So , he c o ul d n ' t me e t with us .
But I felt as if I should help him in some way .
M a y b e if I could talk to him about his pro ble m , he might not be on leave because of it .
I went to the r ock c l im b ing g y m .
I could c l im b more than last time because my hi p ' s get ting better .
I felt that he al th is the most im p or t ant thing for hu man s .
I was tired , never th e less , I went to the g y m .
I ' m ha p p y being able to go to the c l im b ing g y m .
B e c a us e I could me e t my friend s who m I am always e age r to me e t .
A f a m ous J a p an e se c l im b er name d Y u j i a c c o m p l ish ed many f e at s there .
I tri ed some new cha ll e ng es but they were t o o difficult for me .
A fter all , I did n ' t man age to pass le ve l five of the cha ll e ng e .
I c a n ' t speak English well .
I went dr in k ing with No b u after w or d .
A th i e f open ed his g y ve w it ha not e and k il led himself with h is sh o e la ce
A n off ic i al on be h al f of the police st ation said to the me d i a th at he k il led himself with h is sh o e la ce after open ing his g y ve with a not e th at was in his h and .
I ' m glad to see the off ic i al is so im a g in at ive .
I ' m not as ir ri t able so much now but I ga in ed 6 k g since then / also and some time s I w an n a eat f o o d s that I did n ' t eat before .
It ' s a little s c ar y .
So I ' ll try to find things I like [ more / to do better ] and I have to go on a di e t !
It see m s that it has been a very hard day for me to day .
It was because I felt g l o o m y un c on s c i ous ly .
I do n ' t know the reason on why I was so an no y ed about everything .
W as it just because I have l ot s of less on s ?
I got out of te m p er to my friend s as much as I felt sorry for her .
She understand s me well because we are be st friend s .
As tomorrow is a school ho l i day , I ' ll take a re st at home co m f or t ably .
If some on e is g l o at ing too much .
You are ex a g g er at ing too much .
I am in W u h an now
It took me 7 hour s to dr ive from S h i y an to W u h an . I am very tired , but when I think that I will see my de ar brother here tomorrow morning , I am so ha p p y !

from other co un t ri es , and many J a p an e se people .
They could speak English f l u ent ly , which made me think that
I have de c id ed to start writing for a T e a ch er ' s ex a m next w in ter .
I ' ve heard that The United States in t ro d u c ed a s y s te m that ra te s the teacher ' s
What I thought was the most interest ing , was that this s y s te m as se s se s teachers with students s c or es .
I do n ' t think students s c or es should be the stand ar d for an est a b l ish ment .
F or ex amp le , va ri e t ies of teaching me th o d s and ma ter i al s should be in v o l v ed in the c ri ter ion for as se s s ing the teachers .
A f er n begin s to gr ow on the str u c ture name d pro th a ll us , which is gr e en and who se sha pe is similar to a heart mar k , and a f er n is brought up / / will be brought up through a l ot of comp le x even t s . / / ten se con s is ten c y
G en er ally speak ing , a `` w ar a b i `` is in ed i ble , but it s you ng s te m is ed i ble if you c ook it c or re c t ly .
When I had a b as is c he c k - up at the comp an y ,
I was told to go to a ho s p it al to have another c he c k - up .
The re s ul t of my c he c k - up was also a ne m i a .
I have to get the ir on by in j e ction , 2 0 time s as a treat ment
It will be t ough for me ! ! !
I have been stay ing at my in - law ' s house the se past three days to sp en d our new year ' s days with them .
I got `` O t o s h id a m a `` from both my hu s b and and my in - law s this morning .
I p r a y ed for our family ' s good l u c k there .
My new year ' s re s o l u tion is here .
So , this year I want to try to do u ble the am o un t of b ook s .
I would like to pai n t 1 0 ar t w or k s a month .
I ' m not good at us ing the comp ut er and I ' m not f a m il i ar with the so c i al ne t w or k ing s y s te m in the In ter ne t .
I still do n ' t know how to us e this we b s ite , which is very comp le x for me to understand .
I ' ve just come back to J a p an from B o st on and N e w Y or k .
I visit ed s ever al c l i ent s d ur ing the day time and we went to some re st a ur ant s and b ar s at night .
I want to do hu n d r ed s of things .
It is some time s hard because of my poor English ; however I have tru ly good ex pe ri ence s * . B y the way , I mo v ed into a new house last S at ur day .
A c t u ally , it was my f if th time mo v ing . . .
I ho pe this will be my last house even though I have had bad l u c k with house s .
This one is very n ic e because it is c ut e and c le an ! !
There is a k it ch en , a bath ro o m and two be d ro o m s just for my friend and I : D F or now I am living with the previous ten ant , but my friend is going to mo ve in next S un day !
I am re ally look ing for w ar d to it .
Well , I am p l an n ing to go to school again in S ept e m b er ! !
I should keep writing every day , re ally ! ! ! !
I am going to go back to J a p an in F e b r u ar y .
I want to get much better s k i ll s before then . . .
I ho pe I do my be st : P
I have got a new job , so I ' m going to tell my bo s s that I am qu it ing .
Yes ter day I tri ed to tell him / her , but I could n ' t find a good time .
I will do it on mo n day for sure : )
I have become the direct or of a comp an y now .
It is going to start on the 1 st F e b .
My English friend now is stay ing at my house in J a p an as a home st a y .
Besides that I have intention to le ar n D an ish , which will be the six th language I ' ll know .
In ter d is c i p l in ar y , p r a c t ical st ud ies , a wide ch o ic e of course s , ex pe ri ment al spirit ( ? ) and open - mind ed ness are reason s why I am so ent h us i a st ic about R U .
It is a p en c il sh ar p en er .
It ' s so c ut e !
I ' ve been le ar n ing English for about 9 year s with a 4 year b re a k , but I ' ve never had con ta c t with people who speak English . So I think that in my future po st s you will find l ot s of po l ish in f l u ence .
My idea for a life , I think , is to make all dr e a m s come tru e do ing everything that I can at the moment .
I ha te living in one place and do ing the same thing every day .
My f a v o ur ite sub j e c t s are ma th s and p h y s ic s , so probab ly I will have a pro ble m with con ne c ting them with tra ve ling or something like that .
But re c ent ly I heard about cha r ity or g an i z ation s which need e ng in e er s and it could be a n ic e idea .
I de p ar ted N A R I T A a ir p or t at 1 1 : 3 0 for S ing a po re .
but I feel tired because of di f f er ence te m p er a ture between S ing a po re and J a p an .
I s l ept long last night .
S ing a po re is in the ra in y sea s on s .
I ` m look ing for w ar d to the day when my school start s = )
I am p r a c t ic ing writing comp o s i tion s to im p ro ve my writing ability for the G E P T ex a m in ation . - - - - - - - - -
If you are study ing , you would n ` t want some on e to both er you .
L a st night , J en n y was study ing for a t est .
If I were an an im al , I would be a c at ! !
A c t u ally , I l o ve c at s !
When a c at say `` my a o ~ `` , I f a ll in l o ve with the c at .
If I can be a c at , I will go out for a walk the who le day , sleep unti l I feel good , be along with people when I l on e ly .
I finish ed read ing the second b ook of the s er ies `` A S er ies of U n f or t un ate Even t s `` in English .
C o m p ar ed to the first b ook , the second one is more compli c at ed .
I would l o ve to finish read ing it in three days .
As soon as I saw it f a ll , I dis c o ver ed it was a w al n ut .
It was sp l it open and ro ll ing in the ro ad .
S ud d en ly , something f le w down to get the w al n ut .
I not ic ed that a c r ow d ropped the w al n ut from his be a k to the gr ound in or d er to b re a k the she ll .
The c r ow must have know n gra v ity ex is ted before we came to understand it .
This happen ed on one of my bu s y days , so I felt ha p p y .

No w a day s the we a ther is so hot !
It ' s like a s te ame r outside but inside it is very co l d because of the a ir c on d i tion er .
You may think I make absurd remark s , but I ' m get ting sick and tired of us ing the
It ' s so ri d ic ul ous !
We should only turn on an a ir condition er when ever need ed and in mo d er ation .
R e c ent ly , I watch ed ' G r an To ri no ' direct ed and star r ed by C l in t E a st w o o d on T V .
I think this is one of C l in t E a st w o o d be st f il m s .
They were having a le c ture about his m us ic care er .
He play ed the con t r a b as s and the g u it ar .
H is m us ic is play ed at the end of G r an T ri no .
I am in my first year of un ive r s ity and I ' m c ur r ent ly study ing English and J a p an e se as ma in sub j e c t s .
I ' ve always l o v ed le ar n ing new language s and the se are de f in ite ly the one s that I like the most .
I re ally enjoy le ar n ing new w or d s a d express ion s and when I do n ' t know the right way to say something or the right w or d for something you ' ll litera l ly see me run n ing to w ar d s the di ction ar y and gra b b ing it as soon as I can !
As far as J a p an e se is conc er n ed , It ' s always at t r a c ted me in a way and so , since my town has one of the be st language in s it ut es in I ta ly ( can you say that about a un ive r s ity ? I do n ' t know . . ) I ' ve de c id ed to study this cha r m ing language . Yes you can say that
S in ce s um m er va c ation started , I always stay ed up to play comp ut er game s and even unti l A M 1 3 : 0 0 .
Besides , little ex er c is e made me ga in w e i g h t , so I want to go to the g y m and go on a di e t .
This ti t le come s from my favor ite so ng s un g by G re en day , one of many U S b and s .
As they said , It ' s es s ent i al for you to know your e ne m y which cause s you trouble .
As for me , To day ' s e ne m y is unti d y f at around my st o m a ch !
A f e w week s a g o , I went to A ust r al i a for sight se e ing .
The tra ve ll ing ( T ri p ) was very enjoy able , but I at e high - c al or i e me al s many time s d ur ing my tri p .
( In particular , on the p la ne to A ust r al i a , f light c re w s kind ly serve d me me al s five time s )
A fter I came back to J a p an , my we i g h t in c re as ed by more than three k g before I left .
And I have n ' t change the trouble s ome part of my body yet .
It e m p ha s i z ed that it ' s im p or t ant that the c al or ies you con s um e must be high or e qu i v al ent against that you take in .
That ' s why I de c id ed to eat l ow - c al or i e f o o d s and to go j o g g ing every day .
Then there were good things and bad things .
The l at ter is that going outside in w in ter as much as possible is not normal be ha v i or !
I ' m think ing that L an g - 8 might be a good way to me e t some on e who speak s n at ive English .
D o es any on e know a English speak er who want s to study J a p an e se ?
P le a se let me know .
In ex change , I can tea ch them J a p an e se !
When I was enjoy ing cha t ting at about 3 - ish , I consider ed going to be d , but I thought if I went to be d once I would n ' t be able to w a ke up at 6 and con t in u ed cha t ting ti ll I went to school .
I was a b it sleep y at school , so I de c id ed not to do that again .
A l m o st all j a p an e se business m en us e the train .
Some of them b r ow se the ne t on their mo b il es , some read some b ook s , and other s sleep on the train .
Some time s those who are sea ted le an against me .
And they ' re he a v y .
I think they are very tired at their office , because of having to work so much
So they want to sleep as much as possible .
To day people s it ting next to me were .
I ' m a J a p an e se woman .
I want to express my thought s in English .
I de c id ed that this year , I ' m going to write a di ar y every day , and I ' ll get my English c or re c ted by people on L an g - 8 .
She is J a p an e se , and works as a n an n y in E ng l and .
So , I want to speak in English to her .
P l ant a you ng tree
Yes ter day father and I p l ant ed some you ng tree s .
There are five kind s of tree s which are about one or two - year s old .
They ' re ma p le s , v in es , and some k or e an n at ive kind s of tree s .
B e f or e we went to our ga r d en to p l ant , we went to a re st a ur ant for l un ch .
Then we me t my el d est s is ter and her hu s b and by ch ance in the re st a ur ant .
My b ro ter - in - law , who ' s name is M r .
P ar k , j o in ed .
And we p l ant ed tree s and c le an ed the ga r d en .
It took about two hour s to finish .
Yes ter day , a friend of mi ne re c o m m en d ed this we b s ite to me .
To a new come r like me , it is a re ally interest ing and us e ful we b s ite .
I find what most appeal s to me is that one can im p ro ve his or her ability in a for e i g n language while / ma k ing new friend s from all over the world .
This D is ne y c ar t o on was very funny and am a z ing to us .
My mo m , you ng er s is ter , and I de c id ed to go to see the mo v i e this morning .
The ti c ke t s are ex p en s ive because they includ e 3 - D g la s se s to see the mo v i e .
I l o ve D is ne y mo v ies .
I went to a hot sp r ing to day .
It o c c ur r ed to me that J a p an e se people do n ' t he s it ate to take a bath with other s , but we are sh y to talk with for e i g n er s .
I think that ' s why J a p an e se are sh y .
What do you think about this ?
A n an n u al meeting of ne ur o s c i ence so c i e ty will be he l d from the next S at ur day to We d ne s day in C h ic a g o .
This is the first time to go to U .
And I have never been on in ter n ation al f light alone .
I know almost nothing about in ter n ation al tra ve ll ing !
And some time people say `` U .
So , I ' m re ally an x i ous about this tri p .
To day I b ough t a b ook by M or im i To m i h i k o at the b ook st or e in my co ll e g e , where all the co ll e g e students and teachers can bu y b ook s at a five per c ent dis c o un t off the re g ul ar p ri ce .
M o st of the J a p an e se co ll e g es have such b ook st or es . ) The ti t le of the b ook is ' K it s un e No H an ash i . ' ( ' K it s un e No H an ash i ' mean s ' A story about a f o x . ' ) I find the story very my s ter i ous .
I do n ' t think M or im i To m i h i k o is well know n through out the world , so let me explain who he is .
No w he live s in K y ot o and the set ting s of most of his no ve l s are in K y ot o .
A l th ough many of the ma in character s in his no ve l s are d u ll co ll e g e students , his litera ry style is very co l or ful and so p h is t ic at ed !
In J a p an , his b ook s are very p op ul ar among you ng people , es pe c i ally co ll e g e students .
When ever I read his b ook s , I am f as c in at ed by his wonder ful litera ry style .
F ur ther m or e , his st or ies are very enjoy able .
A n y way , I am fond of his b ook s .
But I ' m afraid his b ook s are very difficult to tra n s l ate into other language s .
I ' m going to finish read ing ' K it s un e No H an ash i ' to day .
, A fter that , I have to conc ent r ate on p re p ar ing for next S un day ' s S T E P t est !
B e c a us e I want to draw CHA R T S in ex ce l us ing p y th on , I ' m read ing M ic ro s o f t E x ce l b in ar ies .
The E x ce l b in ar y for m at is know n as `` C o m p ound D o c u ment `` .
The first se c t or is a `` head er se c t or `` that point s to the `` di ction ar y se c t or `` , and to da ta str u c ture s like the F A T ( f i le all o c ation t able ) in the F A T 1 6 / 3 2 f il es y s te m .
The by te str e a m is a se qu ence of B I F F R e c or d s .
I had never had ex p re ri ence of a ha ll stuff me m b er before , so I always be ten s ed up d ur ing work ing .
R e c ent ly , I felt a little re la x because I got a c c ust ome d to work ing as a ha ll stuff me m b er .
To day is the most bu s y in my ex pe ri ence days .
I could not only have a b re a k but dr in k a g la s s of water .
To m or r ow , I have a work as a ha ll stuff me m b er but I have a day off after to m m or r ow , so I can not stand it .
The U S p re s id ent B us h will finish his ter m in office soon .
I ' ve always thought he is re ally in c a p able and d u ll .
( A g a in , it ' s just my person al opinion . ) In sp ite of being in c a p able , people can still be po l it ic i an s .
There are many such po l it ic i an s in J a p an , too .
P ro b ably , they also could be a head of state , if they had some ad v ant age , such as c r ow d - p ul ling cha ri s m a .
So I ' m wonder ing what B us h ' s a d v ant age is .
I still c a n ' t think of anything .
A ccord ing to the new s , the sh o es were not the re p or ter ' s
He p re p ar ed big and he a v y sh o es for the at ta c k .
If it had hi t B us h , he would have sure ly got ten in j ur ed .
Then , f in ally , I dis c o ver ed B us h ' s a d v ant age .
What g o o d re f le x es he has .
He has c at - like re f le x es .
I wonder if he play ed any sp or t s when he was you ng er .
If that were a J a p an e se po l it ic i an , they would get hi t and in j ur ed ter ri b ly .
I do n ' t think he could be the U S p re s id ent d u e to his good re f le x es though .
I ' m sure you ' ve already see n it a l ot , but have another look at those in c r ed i ble re f le x es !
E s pe c i ally , the first th r ow !
N e x t month , I will be at ten d ing a co ll e g e .
I ' ve become fool ish .
I be l on g to a ten n is c l u b .
I usual ly play ten n is six time s a week .
The one in the back g r ound is un k n ow n , because I have for g ot ten what was print ed on the name ta g of it .
The s and w i ch co st s 2 8 0 y en . I at e that one first .
I probab ly c a n ' t get ra w ha m at or d in ar y st or es .
It ta st es high - gra d e , hu m ! + l o l w ut ? +
To day is mo n day . I just finish ed my ho l i day and ar ri v ed back from my home t ow n .
No w I ' m work ing in my comp an y and I feel a little tired . M a y b e I enjoy ed too much d ur ing this ho l i day , so I c a n ' t a c c l im at i z e myself to different place or people , e t c .
I think in a f e w days I will be fine . ( `` can get right `` sound s a w k w ar d and un c le ar )
R e c ent ly , I ' ve been feel ing re ally bad .
That make s me feel very bad .
I think I need time to re la x to help me f i x this pro ble m .
So I will do more ex er c is e to re la x .
I think I can make this pro ble m go away .
I d ropped in at a de p ar t ment st or e at N i h o m b ash i on my way back home .
A fter four days , I hold a C h ri st m as part y .
I will ex change with my friend s present s ga ther ed by us .
It co st s about 1 0 0 0 Y en per present .
I was at a los s for a while , but I b ough t a sh o es - keep er that includ e de o d or i z er s .
N an o te ch no l o g y is one of the most pro m is ing are as for the s c i ence and te ch no l o g y f i el d .
B e c a us e of it s part ic le s i z e , which is less than 1 0 0 n m , a n an p ar t ic le has different me ch an ical , physical , c he m ical , and electronic proper t ies than that of bu l k ma ter i al s .
A n e ng in e er ed n an op ar t ic le has many a p p l ic ation s such as dr u g de l ive ry , so l ar ce ll s , c le an man u f a c t ur ing pro ce s s , co s m etic s , and so for th .
V en ture c a p it al s , go ver n ment s , and in d ust ri es have in ve st ed t re m en d ous am o un t s of money for sp ur r ing the in no v ation of n an o te ch no l o g y .
While the b ri g h t side of e m er g ing n an o te ch no l o g y has been ex ten s ive ly co ver ed by me d i a , the s a f e ty of n an op ar t ic le s has only at t r a c ted a small am o un t of at ten tion .
B e c a us e of it s s i z e , a n an op ar t ic le could be in ha led when we are ex po s ed to it .
On ce a n an op ar t ic le is in the en v ir on ment as a pro d u c t or as a by p ro d u c t from fact or ies , it is p r a c t ic ally im po s s i ble to de te c t because of it s s i z e .
English pro n un c i ation
I have work ed for an A m er ic an comp an y for 4 year s .
A ll of my co ll e a gue s are b il ing u al .
O f course , each have different le ve l s of English pro f ic i en c y , but my comp an y require s that each person s c or es at least 73 0 point s on the T O E I C .
There f or e , our e m p l o y e es ' English pro f ic i en c y is high er than other J a p an e se comp an ies .
O ther co un t ri es , G er man y for ex amp le , most of their e m p l o y e es can speak English rather than J a p an e se .
H ence , 73 0 T O E I C point s are co m m on for them .
But an English a c c ent is not associated with T O E I C s c or e .
Even if people have a 9 0 0 T O E I C s c or e , their pro n un c i ation is not good .
I found out this fact when I j um p ed on with this comp an y .
A woman co ll e a gue can write English e - ma il very well but she speak s with a very strong J a p an e se a c c ent .
It ' s difficult for us to im p ro ve the pro n un c i ation by only read ing or writing for e i g n language .
F or A m er ic an s , J a p an e se `` F ut on `` is a my s ter i ous sound because sha pe of mo us e for `` F u `` is different between A m er ic an English and J a p an e se .
I ' m c a n ' t speak e ng l ish very well , but I re ally want to be f l u ent in my English s k i ll s .
I want talk about many st or ies but it ' s difficult . . . .
English class is the hard est .
I c a n ' t understand my e ng l ish pro f es s s or ' s le c ture . . . .
I do not understand how us e of p re po s i tion s such as in , on , at , and of .
it was ra in y to day .
it was very difficult ! ! ! !
It was to t est whether we could write character s beautiful ly .
It is very b ri g h t , s un n y and di z z i ly hot to day .
P le a se take care not to get de h y d r at ed or s u f f er from he at str o ke .
It ' s probab ly better not to be ex po s ed to the s un and he at for a very long time .
E n ough water and e le c t ro ly te s will help p re v ent s u f f er ing from the he at .
T a ke care and enjoy s um m er as much as possible .
I like five - to ed s ock s and we ar it almost every day .
They are quite co m f or t able because my feet do n ' t get s w e at y .
One day , a friend of mi ne found me we ar ing five - to ed s ock s and said to me , `` I know they ' re co m f or t able and I like them too , but c a n ' t we ar them .
When my mo m was we ar ing five - to ed s ock s , da d said that it was enough to turn off even a l o ve that last ed a 1 0 0 year s ( a J a p an e se pro ver b ) .
M m m , it may look a little go o f y , but I do n ' t think it ' s that bad .
How would you feel if your girl f ri en d or bo y f ri en d w or e them ?
You should try we ar ing them if you have never .
Some th ing F un n y !
My friend P h il i p p and I went to the office this morning by bu s .
He had to call the guy who would hand the ke y over to him .
The ke y was ent r ust ed to him by P h il i p p ' s G er man friend .
A t begin n ing , `` # $ % ! @ # % ! @ # $ `` P h il i p p said in G er man , but the one on the op po s ite end of the p h on e line did n ' t re p ly .
So P h il i p p said , `` D o you speak G er man or English ? `` And then , they began to cha t in English .
A fter two or three sen t ence s , he asked , ' D o you speak C h in e se ?
And he turn ed out know ing how to speak C h in e se .
The guy is a C h in e se like we are . .
I was laugh ing unti l we got out of the bu s .
I have started an English t w e e t .
I ' m going to t w e e t about da i ly life , family , sp or t s , my job and more in English .
If you ' ve have t w it ter account , please follow me .
J a p an e se mar ri age s y s te m
In my country , we do not need to v ow when we get mar ri ed . [ C or re c t but we ir d ]
B ri d es and gr o o m s simpl y go to c ity office s and turn in the mar ri age a p p l ic ation for m , which has the b ri d es ' , the gr o o m s ' , and two w it ness es ' sign a ture s .
No picture I D s are require d to turn in the mar ri age a p p l ic ation for m .
The law does not even require the co up le to g o to the c ity office .
Some body else can go there in s te ad of the co up le .
B e c a us e of the s y s te m , some time s pro ble m s a ri se .
When a co up le go es to the c ity office to turn in their mar ri age for m , they some time s find out that one of them ( or both of them ) is already mar ri ed to some on e else .
No one person has receiv ed more prais e and a b us e than S te ve n J o b s , who is the C E O of A P P L E & amp ; P I X A R c or p or ation , as well as being co ver person for over 2 0 0 f a m ous ma g a z in es .
I was as t on ish ed by J o b s ' le c ture spoke n at S t an f or d U n ive r s ity in 2 0 0 5 , which includ ed three st or ies , and tell us to follow our heart , to find our go al s .
He did n ' t know what the mean ing of con t in u ing his study in a co ll e g e where fee s are so ex p en s ive that it co st most of his p ar ent s ' money .
In s te ad of this , J o b s started to dr op in the call i g r a p h y class in his co ll e g e , which s up p l i ed the one of be st call i g r a p h y train ing in the who le country .
A t this time , he was just interest ed in this class but was n ' t conc er n ed about a w ar d s .
U n t il he c re at ed the first A P P L E comp ut er , all the effect s what he had done before came back .
On ce you tru st something and follow your heart as well as work hard , one day when you look ing back , you can clear ly know the se c re t s of the se do t s you have done .
He was ex pe ll ed on the gr ant s c al e from A P P L E , which he c re at ed .
N ever th e less , he said that he has been re j e c ted , but he will still l o ve .
D r a m at ic ally , the se str i k ing things let him found his dr e a m b o at , he est a b l ish ed a new comp an y ; N E X T , p ur ch as ed P L X A R and became the C E O of A P P L E again .
So do n ' t ( set t le / set t le down ) , keep look ing your l o ve .
I ' m f in ally writing my j o ur n al . . . . !
A c t u ally , the se days are kind of he c t ic and I could n ' t sp ar e time for do ing it .
But it is a fact that I had n ' t been writing j o ur n al ent ri es .
Even though I s k i p p ed do ing it for only 1 day .
let me explain them !
F ir st , when I want ed to write , there was something was wrong with my P C !
To make matter s w or se , I had no time left
As those who have read my j o ur n al s know , I started work ing part time ( my job con s is t s of g i v ing out le a f le t s outside ) and I was kind of bu s y .
In fact , I work ed to day too .
I said that I will e ar n enough money on my own to study a b ro ad in A ust r al i a , but this job is a little hard .
L O L In addition , when I do it , people a v o id me most of the time . . .
I came back home from the U S A yesterday .
I re al i z ed many di f f er ence s between J a p an the U S d ur ing my 3 - week stay on the E a st C o a st .
S e c on d ly , street s in the U S are de s i g n ed in gr id style , and each street has it s own name .
F or in st ance , the name s of the street s are number s ( like `` E 3 2 S t re e t `` , `` 5 th A ve n u e `` ) in N e w Y or k .
I ho pe will I me e t some n at ive speak er s and some on e
who can help me express myself .
O f course , I would also like to help those who are le ar n ing J a p an e se .
I read an ar t ic le about S t ar b u c k In st ant co f f e e in the As a h i
I suppose most of A m er ic an people know it well , as it ' s been so l d for a year .
My A m er ic an friend keep s sen d ing it to me , I ' ve been enjoy ing it every day .
If you are a S t ar b u c k s f an , it would be w or th a try .
S a k y o say s `` I could n ' t accept an e v o l u tion b ook like this al th ough I am a s c i - f i write r `` .
I have a certain o b se s s ion with train s .
I set off at 5 : 3 0 a m be ne a th the mo on light to take the 6 : 0 0 A M train .
What I us ed to do on the train was go s s i p about things that happen ed in class with my p al s
when ever I heart he sound from a / the train st ation
To day is a very co l d day , even though J un e will come , tomorrow .
I think J un e is a kind of hot and a very hu m id sea s on , a J a p an e se ra in y sea s on .
So I ho pe there will not be high hu m id ity .
I just have been living in J a p an , but I very very very ha te J a p an e se hu m id c l im ate in s um m er !
L a c k of M ot i v ation
But I stay ed at home all day do ing nothing in particular .
It was a to t al was te of time .
I think I ' d rather go out than stay at home do ing nothing .
But I do n ' t feel like going out or stay ing in to write a re p or t .
I always re g re t it at the end of the day .
It is a very bad morning .
N ever walk the street s of S t .
P e ter s b ur g in - 2 0 de g re e we a ther .
H ot co f f e e , c i g ar e t te s and a w ar m b l an ke t - this is what I need to day .
I ' m c ro ch e ting a case for my ce ll p h on e .
I would like to show my gr and m o ther and my for m er students .
If I have ex t r a time , I may c ro ch e t a c a p for my hu s b and : - )
When I entered sen i or high school and j o in ed the mo un tain e er ing c l u b in 1 996 , I b ough t a head light by P an as on ic .
To day ' s my first l o g in - day .
I ' m a s y s te m con s ul t ant .
and I will qu it my job at the end of next month .
I will be a home - make r and will take care of my ch il d re n .
I some time s go to E C C , E C C is an English con ver s ation school .
My comp an y pai d 8 0 % of the fee for me .
But I will qu it it . A fter that I ' m going to study English .
and I ho pe to con ver se with every on e .
D o you know about hot - water bo t t le s ?
It ' s a bo t t le made of p la st ic or other ma ter i al s ( I do n ' t know what ex a c t ly ) in which you po ur hot water .
You put it in your be d on co l d night s , so you can w ar m your feet and sleep very well .
It ' s a wonder ful it e m .
U n f or t un ate ly , the other day , I got a small ho le in the one that I ' ve us ed for s ever al year s .
So I went sh op p ing to bu y another one .
F or t un ate ly , I found something even better .
It ' s kind of like a hot - water bo t t le , but there are c er ry see d s in a b a g .
You put it in the mi c ro - w a ve for 3 m in , and then it ' s read y to be us ed !
It was a little b it more ex p en s ive , but it ' s my b ir th day soon .
So I b ough t two , one for my feet and the other for my ne c k and should er s .
I ' m not interest ed in B ud d h is m , but yesterday I st ud i ed a little about it .
I came to think that B ud d h is m has pro f ound teaching s .
B ud d ha is a person who is spirit u ally a w a k en ed .
However , even if we could so l ve the pro ble m s , more pro ble m s may a ri se if we would not so l ve it s ro ot s
B ud d ha had know n the ro ot of , which is co m m on in man k in d .
When B ud d ha help ed people in trouble , he had thought not only about the so l u tion of the pro ble m that they face , but also the so l u tion of all trouble s
The va l u e of c ur re n c y always change s .
Even I have done the de al for three year s , I am still con f us ed by the mo ve ment of the mar ke t some time s .
My tra d e re l ies on the two b as ic for m s of an a ly s is : f un d a ment al an a ly s is and the te ch n ical an a ly s is .
F un d a ment al an a ly s is is b as ed on which p ri ce will re f le c t the big new s .
The ch n ical an a ly s is us es the cha r t s as the object s .
L ook at my re c ent tra d e ( for ex amp le ) :
C h in a s up p or t s P or t u g al and bu y s the n ation al bo n d s .
What do you think of my de al me th o d ?
I think every on e has to believe something
H um an s are so we a k so they always want to believe something .
In k or e a for e i g n mission ar ies have been s u c c s se ful ly bra in w ash ing people .
I live in a small c ity where the to t al p op ul ation is almost 2 0 0 0 0 0 .
but In my c ity there are hu n d r ed s of ch ur ch es .
every ho l i day people come into my house tell me about go d and if I do n ' t believe in go d I will go to he ll .
our country us ed to believe in bu d ha but since a d v ance d co un t ri es open ed our mar ke t by for ce 7 0 % of people are c a th o l ic s and pro t est ant s even old me n are start ing to go to a ch ur ch .
It ' s good to go to a ch ur ch but do n ' t push other s to believe it .
he might do n ' t th r ow away at he is t s to he ll .
just one reason I did n ' t believe him .
He ll o !
I am a begin n er of la ng - 8 .
I am a C h in e se . I am study ing English and J a p an e se . I ho pe one day I will be able to write po e m s in English or J a p an e se like I do in C h in e se .
L an g u age is an ar t . C ul ture express ion is a do or .
Let us open the do or and play with the be a ut y of ar t .
This is my first po st in English .
I re g is ter ed on L an g - 8 yesterday .
If any on e c or re c t s this po st , I ' ll be very ha p p y .
B y the way , to day I took the T O E I C .
I think I got half of the read ing se ction c or re c t , but the listen ing se ction was not good .
I could n ' t understand most of the question s . . .
I must study more / hard er .
T h an k you for read ing , by e !
Some th ing w h ite to dr in k
I or d er ed a g la s s of w h ite dr in k when I had dinner at a re st a ur ant yesterday .
I did n ' t know what it was when I began dr in k ing .
C an you gue s s what was is in the g la s s in the picture ?
A c t u ally , it was y o g ur t l i qu e ur .
I go to the train ing g y m and run about three time s in a week .
I of ten listen to r ock m us ic , but I want more so ng s that are sp e ed y and r h y th m ical .
I he ar that m us ic with a B P M of 1 6 0 - 1 8 0 is s u it able for run n ing .
I ' m always look ing for so ng s .
If you have any so ng s that you would like to re c o m m en d , please tell me .
He did not not look well .
So , I took a walk with my d aught er and my so n for 2 hour s .
It is dis a p po in ting because we have three days of ho l i day in a r ow .
I know this S N S , us ing le ar n ing for e i g n language , `` i K n ow `` ( h t t p ; / / w w w . i k n ow . co . j p ) .
Some time s I go a b ro ad , such as T a i w an and other As i an co un t ri es .
English is the most p op ul ar language of co m m un ic ation in the world .
I think co m m un ic ation too l can open up some op p or t un it ies for us .
If possible , I will speak with for e i g n people us ing my English d ur ing my work .
The f l ow er s keep b l o o m ing and ri s ing up to w ar d s the S un .
I s my friend hold ing a k n if e or a g un ?
E ver y th ing around you does n ' t mean a thing .
I am feel ing me l an ch o l ic , which give s me a ch ance to re f le c t on the life that has already pass ed me by .
It hi t me and it even made me write a po e m .
But some time s I think that a good life is n ' t b ook ed for every on e who want s it .
I wish that G o d he l d your hand in time s full of do u b t s . .
The moment that last s can be the be st of all that you have had .
You still have new friend s , the old one s are co ver ed by d ust .
`` English C a f e `` open ed every first S un day of the month . M an y students , teachers and C h ri st i an s ga ther at the part y .
It was different from the usual less on , and the students and the teachers were re la x ed and having f un .
I made many C h ri st i an friend s there .
I ' m not C h ri st i an but I was ha p p y to make friend s .
If I were a woman ~
I ' ll think for a b it about if I were a woman .
The reason I think of it is because it s just enjoy able for me .
If I were woman , my f i g ur e would be more l o ve ly than se x y .
I would have long ha ir ha ng ing down the in front , and the co l or must be black .
My person al ity would be rather c al m and to m b o y ish .
M a y b e I would n ' t be so act ive , so I would n ' t go to to any c l u b s .
I would n ' t be do ing so poor ly at school , but I would ha te study ing .
My ty pe would be a man who is a little bra w n y and has a tender heart .
G o o d D in n er at O m i y a
F or t un ate ly we can us e e le c t ri c p ow er all day long to day , so we can sp en d our day as we usual ly do .
Yes ter day I went to T s ut a y a ( the big g est r ent al D V D and C D sh op in J a p an .
However , we can bu y new D V D s and C D s there . ) with my family because my hu s b and want ed to r ent some D V D s from the sh op .
And then , I dis c o ver ed many im p or ted C D s are so l d for 8 0 per c ent dis c o un t .
I ' m very ha p p y because I could bu y each C D for only 3 0 0 yen ! ! !
That ' s very c he a p ! ! !
To day is the last day of go l d en week .
D ur ing go l d en week , I could n ' t le ar n any more English .
S t ar ting tomorrow , I am look ing for w ar d to le ar n ing English again .
I know that I should we ar them but they make me look like an id i ot .
P e op le tell me to we ar con ta c t l en se s but I think that it make s my eyes un he al th y by a b s or b ing tea r s in my eyes .
T r u th ful ly , I have los t more than five pai r s of l en se s so it is never w or th it .
I think my bad eyes i g h t is d u e to the fact that I like watch ing , read ing , and writing .
A ll of my good friend s mo v ed to a dis t ant place for va ri ous reason s .
I ' m very conc er n ed about it .
I have heard of that M on g o l i an people ' s eyes i g h t is very good d u e to their no bu il d ing s and no mo n it or s en v ir on ment .
They always see well at dis t ance , not like us .
A n y way , some day , I want to get l as i k if it can im p ro ve my eyes i g h t c a us ing no side effect s .
We all should re m e m b er to we ar more c l o th es ^ .
The day before yesterday , it was a sp e c i al d ate for our you ng .
It is so called You th D a y which ce le b r ate s their con t ri b u tion s to our country .
We are just the f l ow er s gr ow ing up he al th i ly and will serve the country after gr ow n ing up .
I feel for t un ate that I can live in a country with such a ra p id ly de ve l op ing e c on o m y and s up er i or mi l it ar y p ow er .
As a un ive r s ity st ud ent in the present age , I have a he a v y b ur d en on my should er s . So , I know that I should have the will to bu il d our country strong er and take every a ction to ga in a good know led g e of s c i ence .
We gr il led be e f , c or n and s a us age s .
I had some be er , which I enjoy ed !
A s ing le house
There are s ever al different ty pe s of house s in A m er ic a .
So far , I ' ve visit ed town house s , con d o s , and a p ar t ment s , but not s ing le home s .
I heard that a s ing le home s are very p ri ce y .
You comp le te ly have your own ga r d en without sh ar ing it with other s .
L a st week , I sp ent two days at my father ' s friend s ' place .
It ' s a re al l u x ur y home .
The l and s c a p ing in the front y ar d is very n ic e .
The ant i ( ? ) ma in tain it in a very ne at and or g an i z ed way .
No t only is the front y ar d good but the back y ar d is too .
They bu il t an out d o or f i re p la ce and a B B Q st o ve .
It ' s two st or ies high and there ' s a sp ir al s ta ir c a se .
E ver y room has it s own bath ro o m and each has two s in k s for was h ing hand s .
The most sp e c i al room has an in d o or w in d ow in it .
You can stand in it and see the who le p an or a m a of first - floor living room .
The S ta f f who V al u ed a H ome Even t over W or k
P re v i ous ly , I w ro te about a t est of the ra d i ation con ta m in ation for f o o d
The ra d i ation sp e c i al ty s ta f f have been perform ing this in s pe ction .
However , our s ta f f were asked to help d u e to a short age of t est me m b er s .
To day the s ta f f who was ch o s en to be a help er want ed a change of d ate .
The reason was because he want ed to part ic i p ate in an a th l etic me e t of his ch il d .
B e c a us e we de c id ed the d ate after having heard the s ta f f ' s s ch ed ul e , this is almost not possible .
I was surprise d that there was a s ta f f who va l u ed a home even t over work .
I f in ally get why they w on the W or l d C up .
O f course , my go al is to be as good as a n at ive English speak er .
but I must get a good s c or e with the T O E I C so that I do my be st to study English now .
While I get into study ing English , my la b has be g un the pro j e c t that la b students have to make a g l id er ro b ot .
It get s hard er and hard er work ing on the pro j e c t .
We had felt difficult y that we might not make the g l id er ro b ot .
That ` s why we took a l ot of ex t r a time .
I want to us e the time study English more than I do .
I ` m re c on s id er ing to make a d j ust ment s to my s ch ed ul e .
I have to never for g e t to make time for both things .
L if e after ma ter n ity leave
This is the first time I write a di ar y in English .
I would re ally be ha p p y if some on e would kind ly read and c he c k my English .
L a st week en d , my hu s b and was not at home , so I invite d my friend s over from the comp an y both on S at ur day and S un day .
They said they were bu s y , and they had to get many days off because their ch il d re n of ten got sick .
In her case , her mother live s near her , so she can get her mother ' s help , and she does n ' t need to get off work .
I felt down when I im a g in ed the life after I start work ing again .
I tea ch It al i an and English ( funny but tru e ) in an As s o c i ation where street bo y s and girl s with difficult back g r ound s are help ed with their home w or k .
One of the guy s was perform ing in the show so he invite d me and other teacher to s up p or t him .
What change s happen ed ?
I want to write about one of the big g est change s to night .
It is natural , but I have live d with my p ar ent s for 2 7 year s .
I was depend ant on my p ar ent s , and in f l u ence s from my p ar ent s was large * 1 .
I believe my a ction s was limit ed to what my p ar ent s all ow ed .
So now I ' m feel ing free like a b ir d le aving the n est .
F or t un ate ly my hu s b and does n ' t in ter f er e with me .
No w after the mar ri age , six month s pass ed . * 2
And then I started two things ( ho b b ies ) , because I felt I could do anything .
I want to write about the new things next time .
My brother will en l is t in and ent er the K or e an mi l it ar y soon .
My brother will en l is t in the mi l it ar y .
K or e a is di v id ed into So u th K or e a and No r th K or e a .
The se days the in ter n ation al new s is not good for every body who live s in K or e a .
( You know the new s about the Y e on p y e on g is l and s . ) So , my family and my re l ation s are w or ri ed about him .
But , he just said that every man in K or e a should go into the mi l it ar y , ex c ept the dis able d .
`` So , do n ' t worry about me . `` he said .
He j o k ed `` P le a se bu y me at for visit ing , es p ch ic k en for da k ga l b i . . . ``
I ' m look ing for w ar d to him coming back home . . .
He will be dis ch ar g ed in 2 0 1 3 . . .
How long do we have to wait for him ? !
To day was a very bu s y day .
I went to G an g n a m st ation to study English at the P a g o d a a c ad e m y .
I me t my friend who serve d in the mar in e .
We talk ed about the old days for about three hour s .
I went to the comp ut er a c ad e m y after our meeting .
The le c ture to day was so difficult , however , I did my be st to make good pro g r a m .
M o st of the people there are old er than me .
es pe c i ally , the old man sit ting n the next to me . He is the old est person in our class .
He thought it would be very hard to le ar n to make a pro g r a m .
He was right .
so , I always help him make pro g r a m s .
My name is M ar i C ar m en and I ' m a new S p an ish us er of L an g - 8 .
I ho pe to im p ro ve my English here and I want to le ar n F re n ch too .
N e x t year , I want to study for a m aster ' s de g re e in D es i g n at a B ri t ish or F re n ch un ive r s ity .
I ho pe to help any on e who need s help with S p an ish .
I agree comp le te ly with his opinion .
How long they work a day is kind of con t ro ll ed by the ur g ent de m and s from their va ri ous s ta ke h o l d er s , so they do n ' t have any dis c re tion ar y time . ( ? )
The w or d s spoke n out of our mouth s are we a k , and e y e con ta c t is full of con f us ion .
It re m in d s me of the B able story , G o d se p ar ate s people with different language s , and people are never un it ed as one any more because of the language s , then the world is full of s us p ic ion and f r ust r ation .
K e e p going !
To day was so ti r ing : P
E ver y th ing made me c r a z y
I do n ' t know what happen ed may b e I just feel con f us ed .
B y the way , a T y p h o on is coming soon and may b e a l ot of students are think ing , `` who a I can re st a day , ho pe ful ly the ty p h o on stay in T a i w an `` .
o h , I feel sleep y
o k I want to go to be d , good night
I ho pe to get a better s c or e than the previous time .
To day , I mo v ed house .
I get my own room f in ally ! !
I was home less , and stay ed at a H i - ho st el in w in n i pe g down t ow n .
I ar ri v ed here 6 days a g o , my v is a is work ing ho l i day ( per m it ) .
So I re ally need ed my room
because the ho st el was ex p en s ive , it was $ 2 9 for a day .
But my room is only $ 3 0 0 a month and re ally close to town ! !
But I have to find a job .
P le a se ~ : ) I w an n a work as b a k er or . . .
Even my e ng l ish is n ' t that great .
But I will do my be st .
And I have some question s . .
D o es this sen t ence make sen se ? ?
P le a se let me know .
A fter I entered e le ment ar y school , my p ar ent s s w it ch ed from run n ing a s up er m ar ke t to own ing a f ri ed ch ic k en re st a ur ant .
A f e w year s after that , they change d the me n u to p or k c ut le t s .
A ll of my friend s en v y ed en v i ed me .
No w they run a gr il led me at re st a ur ant .
When I had my for t un e told over the in ter ne t , it in f or m ed that I had di ed of hung er at an e ar ly age in my previous life .
I would like to write a letter to my English teacher , so I want you to c or re c t my English .
Well . . .
T h an k you for everything you did for me .
I do like your explanation s !
I re ally a d m i re your pro f es s ion al teaching style .
No t only that , you are re ally f l u ent in J a p an e se and have already pass ed the J a p an e se ex a m .
I ' ve never me t a n at ive teacher like you who has st ud i ed J a p an e se as hard as you .
I do n ' t know what I will do without you from now on . . .
Well , I have a present for you .
I will give you a re d b a ll po in t p en .
I will be re ally ha p p y if you could c or re c t my English some day with this p en .
I took the free way for the first time .
I ' ve never take n the free way before .
L a st S un day was my father s b ir th day .
So I went to the J e on g se on - g un where my p ar ent s live .
I dr o ve alone , I ' m not afraid of dr i v ing any m or e .
I ' m good at pass ing other c ar s .
H a ve you ever dr ive n in K or e a ?
It ' s so over c r ow d ed with a c ar .
Some of the dr ive r s have no manner s .
I do n ' t sub m it to any dr ive r s manner s because I ' m a bra ve woman ? ! ^ ^
I do n ' t go because my ex - hu s b and come s .
He said , `` D o n ' t leave ch il d re n , I c a n ' t take care of them ! ``
He does n ' t like that I leave my ch il d re n at ch ur ch .
But my ch il d re n like to play at ch ur ch , and I thought they might feel ha p p y to me e t their far ther .
I ' m very s ad . . . .
I want to be a kind er g ar ten teacher because I like ch il d re n
I went sh op p ing at G in z a after work .
I b ough t a de e p p in k co l or ed shirt .
I felt that the shirt was too ti g h t
But I like it .
I think It ' s by far the most great T - shirt .
I got in to u ch with my girl friend and I said `` I like it very much ! ``
I live in S ant i a g o de C h i le , in a small town on the out s k ir t s of the c ity .
In the first floor I have a k it ch en , a living room and a di n ing room .
A t the second floor there are my room and two room s more for my family .
The wall s of my house are y e ll ow , and the ce il ing is w h ite through o ut the house .
The se days , I am always bu s y .
This is because the t est days are near .
I have to do my home w or k .
In addition , I ' m bu s y at my part time job ! !
I can hard ly wait for sp r ing va c ation .
How to get a dr ive r ' s l ic en se success ful ly ?
This week en d , I will go to the train ing gr ound to le ar n dr i v ing with a train er .
T h ough I understand some of it , I have never dr ive n a c ar .
I am a b it str es s ed about this train ing .
How no is y it is outside !
It ' s too loud for me to to f a ll as le e p , even though it ' s about 4 : 3 0 am here in J a p an .
N ever th e less , my w if e see m s able to con t in u e sleep ing even under
I wonder if we are even s a f e here .
that the sp ar k s will set f i re to it s s ur r ound ing house s and sp re ad
W h o did this ?
are they id ent ical ?
I even did n ' t re al i z e what had happen ed unti l the week had pass ed .
And it see m s that I for g ot a l ot of things , like find ing a part time job , ma k ing a call to my M o m .
I do n ' t re ally know what I was bu s y with , it just pass ed .
F ir st , d ur ing the week day , I got a little bu s y , and things about my work seemed to get better , because my co ll e a gue s treat ed me much better last week , and they seemed more to believe in me now , ex c ept one , who has never said anything n ic e to me .
L i ke me , I am not very p at i ent and sen s it ive about number s , but now , my work is close ly re la ted to number s , It make s me le ar n to be much more p at i ent and care ful .
And I have le ar n ed another im p or t ant s k i ll , that is to write down everything that you do n ' t know , or you can not re m e m b er clear ly , es pe c i ally things which are very im p or t ant to your job .
I know that I should be con f id ent , and should be more sen s it ive , so that my co ll e a gue s will believe in me more .
It seemed like I did n ' t p re p ar e for it well , but it also pass ed quick ly .
In fact , this is my second time to me e t a E - friend , both the se time s turn ed out well .
L i ke me , before I went to see my E - friend s , I was quite s c ar ed , and I was p r a y ing for good l u c k .
But do n ' t over re a c t to it , because there are also a l ot of n ic e people in the world !
M an y big w a ve s are coming from the sea by the in f l u ence of a T y h o on that is a p p ro a ch ing now .
It ' s a good day for s ur f er s .
I ' m going to go body b o ar d ing this after no on .
L a st F ri day , I pass ed the f in al dr i v ing t est at my dr i v ing school ! ! ! ! !
A fter the t est , I said than k you to the in st r u c t or who c he er ed me up when I f a il ed .
A l th ough I could leave the dr i v ing school , I was a little s ad
T h an k s to them , I dr ive very s a f e ly .

I ' ve never written a di ar y in my life , but I ' m sure I can keep up d at ing my b or ing days for English train ing .
This is the first time I ' ve written something since I ar ri v ed in the U S .
When I was in J a p an , I had thought that I could be a great English speak er if I live d in the U S .
But , I was comp le te ly wrong .
J a p an e se s i e g e ment al ity
To day , J a p an is f il led with a s i e g e ment al ity .
M an y you ng J a p an e se do n ' t have the mo t i v ation ( ? ) to work and are un c er tain about their future .
I c a n ' t see my future too clear ly either .
I think the J a p an e se have a l ot of ability , so we can con t ri b ut e more to the world .
O o h ! I ' m e ar n ing a l ot of money .

She did not give me any , and I do not have pass p or t right now .
D o you have any place to re c o m m en d for me ? ( any where is O K )

A n y way , I have a p l an to go to C he on g J u and look for a s u it able ro o m near my co ll e g e with my friend M in S un g on No v .
Well , I ho pe that the room will be very s il ent and c al m , not no is y .
In addition to that , I want it to f it my position .
I mean it ' ll be great if it w o n ' t co st me much money , because I do n ' t re ally want to b ur d en my p ar ent s with the r ent
S pe a k ing of which , M in s un g and I might have to live to g e ther there .
We ' ve been through this , and he think s it ' s going to happen , but I have n ' t de c id ed yet .
I ' ve see n people live to g e ther and always always get ting into fight s with each other about small stuff and end up ha ting each other .
What if that happen s to us ?
But , it would have it s me ri t s .
A c t u ally we would us e English every time we ' re home to g e ther to im p ro ve our English speak ing s k i ll s dr a m t ic ally .
That was M in s un g ' s idea .
Well , it sound ed like a very l o ve ly idea to me when he propos ed it , because I ' ve thought about that too .
A c t u ally I ' m think ing about that .
Well , I do n ' t know what would be a good de c is ion .
N e w f is c al year start s in J a p an from A p ri l .
A t my work p la ce this year ' s person n el change s were an no un c ed .
So my c ur r ent bo s s will mo ve to other po st .
And I will get her job .
I ' m work ing l ate at the office l ate ly . t w ic e l ate ?
I need more time .
I have little time to study English .
A re there any funny p l an n ing on A p ri l ( fool ? ) around you ?
I ' m writing my di ar y for the second time because wrong . ( ? ? ? )
I am writing the di ar y and do ing a l ot of things I c he c k my e - ma il and read hi 5 . My friend s sen d commen t s to me . H i 5 is like face b ook . It is very p op ul ar in th a il and and I cha t ted with my un ive r s ity friend . We talk ed about work . She is not work ing at the moment because I go to out side of bang k o k . ( ? ? ? )
she live s with her family . I know her because she went to bang k o k to study .
I p l an to part y this s un day at my close st friend ' s b ri th day .
She a d v is e me to go there and I think I will be ha p p y because after I finish ed un ive r s ity I did not see them for a long time
may b e we will go home l ate .
B e c a us e we cha t a l ot .
It is hard to un l ock the do or to my front do or re c ent ly .
I think it ' s because of the te m p er a ture or the hu m id ity .
T e a ch ing ch il d re n is very difficult for me .
B e c a us e they ' re so r ow d y that s ome time s I c a n ' t con t ro l them .
But also I of ten get str e ng th from them .
I think I must be t ough er and study hard er to see them smile .
It ' s M ar ch and it ' s a new se m est er .
They all look like gentle and good ch il d re n .
I wish every on e ha p p i ness !
I s everything all right ?
I feel alone here .
I wish that every on e is ha p p y !
I did n ' t know I ' ve us ed more m us c le s to f r ow n so many days .
Why do we feel it ' s hard to smile even though s m il ing us es less m us c le s ?
To day I ' m going to talk about my morning .
( I ' m not sure which is c or re c t . )
I w o ke up at 7 a m , because of my al ar m .
Then I hi t s no o z e , in s te ad of turn ing off the al ar m , and I s l ept unti l 7 : 2 0 a m .
So I had s l ept about 2 0 minute s long er than I in ten d ed .
It help ed me to get up with en er g y .

A n y way , it ' s F ri day !
I am poor at listen ing and speak ing in English c or re c t ly .
To speak with c or re c t pro n un c i ation , I read the sen t ence s in the te x t b ook al o ud at the bath .
But I do not feel I am ma k ing pro g re s s with my English .

But the dis t ance is only 5 k m - too short to say it ' s a `` mar a th on `` .
Yes ter day was so co l d and w in d y it was too hard for us to run .
But we ra n for about 1 hour talk ing with each other .
T r a in ing the body is im p or t ant .

We had a re ally f un time !
My father is still di a g no s ed with I V p ha se of can c er . . .
We usual ly us e an in ter ne t con f er ence s y s te m .
In such sit u ation , it give s me difficult y of j o in ing a con ver s ation .
I have to f i x this pro ble m first
The ch er ry b l o s s o m s are sp e c i al for the J a p an e se .
We are look ing for w ar d for the ch er ry b l o s s o m s every sp r ing .
The new s p a p er and the we a ther for e c a st in f or m us when the ch er ry b l o s s o m s come out .
My house is near a po st office .
To the left of my house is a b ar b er sh op .
When I go to the mar ke t I can see many kind s of things , such as a b ar b er sh op , a sh op p ing ma ll , and a kid s ' school , as well as my own school .
M in e is a middle class family ; that ' s why I live in a middle class family house .
Yes ter day I saw `` L i ke S t ar s on E ar th `` .
To day , I saw the 3 id i ot s .
The se are such great mo v ies .
The direct or is also the le ad act or .
The two mo v ies made me c ry , because they made me think about myself .
My N at ive A c c ent
I was b or n in no r th - e aster n re g ion of J a p an .
T h o se who were b or n there have a dis t in c t a c c ent .
A l th ough there are many a c c ent s in J a p an , the a c c ent of our are a us ed to be called `` c or n y . ``
I was made f un of because of my a c c ent in front of my friend s when I was a ch il d .
I was so hu m il i at ed by my a c c ent d ur ing my ch il d h o o d that I tri ed to mo d if y it .
That ' s why I can speak co m m on a c c ent too .
I took a class to study the str u c ture of J a p an e se language and became a volunteer to day .
O ur teacher told us we should not be as ha m ed of our own a c c ent s because each a c c ent was c re at ed by their c ul ture s .
She let me speak al o ud in my a c c ent in front of other students .
I wonder if many people all over the world are pro ud of their n at ive language s .
I ' m very pro ud of my a c c ent now !
B e c a us e it was g if ted by my ance st or s .
To day I had less on at G A B A with a new teacher who was from E ng l and .
F ir st I asked him some b as ic question s , like `` where are you from ? `` , `` what is your favor ite J a p an e se f o o d ? `` , and `` What is your ho b b y ? `` One of his ho b b ies was c ook ing , so we talk ed about c ook ing and f o o d s .
I was very surprise d that English people like d very hot c ur ry .
Then I talk ed about my favor ite In d i an re st a ur ant in I ke b u ku ro .
To m or r ow morning , I would take a to e ic ex a m in school .

When I was in K or e a , my one of big pro ble m s was my we a k English listen ing s k i ll s .
It ' s so difficult even now .

I have already been living in T or on t o for 3 month s ,
( When ever I go to c in e m a , I get easily f r ust r at ed . )
but I could n ' t understand everything .
When would I be able to understand the new s , mo v ies and p op so ng ?
I am always dr e a m ing that I would be able to tra ve l every where without the need for English .
listen ing ne m o
N e m o : D ad d y help me

S or ry to my teacher
No w I can give my opinion and receiv e a d v ic e from other s in s te ad of just let ting ( as k ing ) my friend s help me .

What was even more ex c it ing was that I receiv ed 9 c or re ction s .
I also c or re c ted a co up le of ent ri es , however , the my pro f i le st at us show ed just 1 c or re ction was made .
A fter the in ter v i e w , I ( will ) help give back more .
I ' m in Tokyo , the c a p it al of J a p an , right now .
I at ten d ed a se m in ar how to think while ma k ing sen t ence s in English .
M an y J a p an e se ten d to tra n s l ate what they want to say litera l ly .
F or ex amp le , if I want to say that he is st u b b or n , I can say he never change s his opinion .
I le ar n ed that I need to have more va ri ous point s of view through this se m in ar .
A fter the se m in ar , some part ic i p ant s , includ ing the teacher and I , went for a dr in k at a b ar .
We talk ed a l ot and had a b la st , and it was interest ing that one of the part ic i p ant s talk ed his ex pe ri ence s when he ' d been in G er man y .
In c id ent ally , I ' m writing this ent ry with / on my i P h on e ! !
I usual ly co m m ut e by c ar , but I ' ll us e a mo t or c y c le to s a ve money .
However , it is very very s l ow to op ar ate .
She c a n ' t still s w im very well yet , so she want ed to us e her in n er t u b e the who le time .
But she im p ro v ed a little after one hour .
I can s w im very well because I us ed to p r a c t ic e s w im m ing in high school d ur ing after - school act i v it ies .
A n y way , we had a l ot of f un .
O f course it is in J a p an , but I saw some w or d s written in English : `` T I C K E T M A C H I N E S `` , `` E X I T , `` and `` C O U P O N T I C K E T `` .
He is quiet and keep think ing ( is m us ing ) .
He need s to be in the se c ur ity when the se five people are around in so c i e ty .
He see m s to a d d ic t him s el ve s with fact s and i nformation . i nformation has no p l ur al !
While he think s more further about my s ter i o s and his interest , . . .
. . . he will ga ther the know led g e .
L if e will be de v id ed into each part that let him feel s a f e when he se p ar ate people into va ri ous gr o up s .
A l th ough he does n ' t like ex a c t ly time f r ame act i v it ies and dis c i p line . . . .
. . . he still want to know what people expect from his work or his le is ur e time . He will be in the position to provide a good p l an .
He has a certain c re at i v ity and make good de c is ion s .
but I just happen ed to dis c o ver L an g - 8 and I ' ve started ( us ing it ) .

There were different kind s of question s to c he c k writing s k i ll , writing your opinion free ly , s um m ar i z ing the read ing pass age or s um m ar i z ing the listen ing di al o gue .
I was very bad at s um m ar i z ing the listen ing part of the di al o gue .
The re s ul t has not come yet , but it ' s o b v i ous . . .
We c a n ' t have a c at in the c ur r ent a p ar t ment but my w if e had one when she was in K y us h u .
The c at ' s name is R in and now she live s at my w if e ' s p ar ent s ' house .
She is afraid of every body ex c ept my w if e ' s p ar ent s .
When we visit ed their house this A u g ust and said he ll o to R in , She quick ly c l im b ed to the ce il ing of the w ar e h ous e .

H i .
My name is T at s u k i Ka n i w a .
I ' m 2 5 year s old .
I ' m le ar n ing English serious ly because my dr e a m is to be a high school English teacher .
when I was a un ive r s ity st ud ent , my ma j or was English litera ture .
after gradua ting from the un ive r s ity , I live d in C an ad a for a year to study English .
This M a y & n b s p ; I came back to J a p an .
I & n b s p ; want to make a l ot of friend s , so please con ta c t me .
J a p an e se like to read `` M an g a `` .
R e c ent ly , I think that J a p an e se like to play a game s too .
There are a d ul t s who play game s in the train .
The other day , I saw a woman play ing a game and walk ing in a bu s y street !
I like play ing game s too .
But we must ch o o se the c or re c t place s to play a game .
I wonder what do for e i g n er s think about this .
S in ce both my language ex ch an g ing part n er s , Z a c and M ar k are bu s y at school , I some time s talk to them though , I think it is n ' t enough for me to speak English . I got it !
I ' m very tired .
Well , I ' m a six te en year old girl .
So , I c a n ' t [ speak / write ] English very well .
That is me . N ic e to me e t you !
To day I went to high school .
I want my teacher to be interest ing .
He was tak ing a ho l i day from the 1 8 th of D e ce m b er to the 1 8 th of J an u ar y .
So we had a less on with another teacher who is E th i op i an d ur ing his ho l i day .
We have had less on s from the E th i op i an more than the English teacher l ate ly .
He question s us one by one , and we try to answer but some students can not answer .
When another st ud ent help s them , he say s at once , `` I asked her , not you . ! ``
It end ed with an un p le as ant at m o s p he re .
A fter that we f e ar ed this time .
But , I ' m look ing for w or d to my friend s coming .
This week en d is going to end in 2 hour s .
I have to go to sleep e ar ly to day .
It was my b ir th day yesterday .
My friend told me that she want ed to give me a surprise .
She asked me my ex - bo y f ri en d ' s p h on e number .
I expect ed she would call him , because she knew I ' m mi s s ing him so bad .
But I suppose he does not mi s s me .
So I told the girl not to do anything .
I ' m wait ing , just wait ing .
It ' s l o ver ' s day .
I ' m living on a far m in S us se x , N e w B r un s w ic k .
They have 5 c at s , 5 ho r se s , 4 co w s , 3 do g s , 3 p i g s , probab ly 2 0 la y ing he n s and a ve g e t able ga r d en !
It ' s very c al m and the a ir is clear .
There are many star s in the s k y at night .
I did n ' t know we would be able to see them without a te le s c o pe .
A l s o I not ic ed my c ity is b ri g h t .
We ' ve for g ot ten that there are many star s in the s k y .
When we not ic e we turn off the light s more of ten than before .
I knew , I like d nature and an im al s but I did not know , I would like far m life so much .
I was living in Tokyo , J a p an before I ' came to C an ad a , on M a y 3 0 th , 2 0 1 1 .
because Tokyo is always bu s y and c r ow d ed .
I ho p ed I could have the ch ance to live in a r ur al place .
I was surprise d when I found out about this we b s ite .
O f course , this is because the el d er ly have more money than the you ng ter s .
In an a g ing so c i e ty , the el d er ly are an im p or t ant t ar g e t mar ke t .
S aving money is consider ed as the bad c ir c ul ation .
A il ing J a p an see s a way out by at t r a c ting the a g ed .
I am p l an n ing to stay in H on g K on g for a month .
And I ' ve sea r ch ed i nformation about where to stay ( there ) .
In the place that I want to r ent a house , the a ver age p ri ce you bu y a house for is about 3 5 0 0 0 0 ( $ 5 4 8 4 . 5 ) y u an per square me ter and the a ver age p ri ce you co st to r ent a 6 0 square me ter house is about 5 0 0 0 y u an per month .
C on s id er if you are the house own er , the house will co st you 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 y u an .
If you let the house , you can get 6 0 0 0 0 y u an per year .
That is to say , you money only gr ow s at a ra te of 2 . 8 6 % , while the c ur r ent one - year de po s it ra te is 3 . 5 % .
With the fact that the p ri ce s of house s have stop p ed ri s ing , why does n ' t the house own er se ll the house and de po s it the money into a b an k or other in ve st ment s ?
I s the ho us ing p ri ce in B e i j ing too high ?
I would like to know the ho us ing p ri ce s and r ent al p ri ce in your place , could you tell me ?
I could n ' t hand le it well yet , but I felt the came r a perform ed well .
The at ta ch ed p h ot o is a street scene at S t an f or d un ive r s ity .
I set the came r a ' s mo d e to No st al g ic M o d e .
And find something interest ing to take picture s of and po st to my b l o g .
you c a n ' t bu y a re p la ce ment for two year s .
Some people also do the same p l an , but the p ri ce s are different .
to be con t in u ed .
The new comp a c t di g it al came r a C X 2 has been re le as ed by R ic o h .
This new came r a a new f un ction .
It can take p h ot o g r a p h s that look like mi n i a ture s .
The l and s c a pe look s like a to y l and s c a pe .
In the future , I think that the new comp a c t di g it al came r as will have this f e a ture .
The p h ot o g r a p h be l ow was take n with the new di g it al came r a .
D o es n ' t this l and s c a pe look like a to y l an s c a pe ?
L un ch time T ri p s !

Some time s I go there to have l un ch .

M or e o ver , a small mo un tain and a la ke is also near my office .
It take s about 5 minute s by b ic y c le to go there .
There is also c a f es by the la ke .
Some time , I take a hot d o g and co f f e e .

To day , I came here to im p ro ve my English writing s k i ll s .
A l th ough I have st ud i ed English for many year s , writing an es s a y is hard for me .
So I think writing once a day will help my English ability .
I have see n some other people ' s di ar ies .
B y the way , if you have any pro ble m s with C h in e se , I can help you .
The ma le c at s K ur o ch an and D or a ch an dr in k the water in the bath t u b .
A f e m al e c at My u ch an la p s up the water from the ed g e of bath t u b .
I like watch ing them la p p ing up the water .
It mean s the `` S ch o o l is close d because of he a v y s n ow `` .
However , they of ten called off school because of a ty p h o on .
My job sit u ation is becom ing bu s y again re c ent ly so I called a b a b y sit ter to day .
To day was o k , because I was able to be back at home e ar l i er than I thought .
I could n ' t get back home before 9 p m for a w h i le and had to re ly on b a b y sit ter every day .
And now , my job is becom ing bu s y again ( even gradua l ly ) and I ' m pretty sure that I ' ll be much bu s i er this s um m er .
But this is my way , I ch o o se it by myself so I ' ll never be able to give up .
This year I receiv ed two sp e c i al ti c ke t s for people who live in M in at o - ku .
So we could sit in front of the f i re w or k s .
It was so beautiful and w or th it to see it every year ! !
O f course , I was free there f or e I was take n there .
It is the ma in place where mo un tain game s will take place in the 2 0 1 0 V an c o u ver O ly m p ic s .
Even the bu il d ing s in W h is t l er V i ll age were beautiful .
It was like the C an ad a that I im age d before I came to C an ad a , or more .
I enjoy ed it very much .
To day , I went to help with the de l ive ry of f ur n i ture .
I got a hu g e mi r r or that was being dis po s ed of . ( ? )
I place d the mi r r or on the back of my desk .
I like it s s i z e
B e c a us e the room appear s large r because of the mi r r or effect .
U n f or t un ate ly , it ' s too big for my desk .
I have to find a good way to put it up . . . . .
I think the e ar th qu a ke will c al m down if there are no more after s h ock s .
But the n u c le ar p l ant a c c id ent is much too serious .
J a p an has been de v a st at ed t w ic e by at o m ic bo m b s .
However , now the F u k ish im a n u c le ar p l ant went bad .
I think may b e there will be after - the - fact re p or t s .
The me l t down has happen ed .
But we must so l ve it .
To day , I got my bo n us .
I have some idea on how to sp en d the money .
But I c a n ' t de c id e what to sp en d it on .
I want to bu y an i po d m us ic play er .
I want to take a f l ow er es s ence se m in ar .
But it is an ex p en s ive se m in ar .
I like play ing it .
I want to eat s us h i unti l I get full .
It ' s 5 am now , but I am still a w a ke .
I c a n ' t sleep even though I have work to day !
H ot so y m il k usual ly help s me sleep , but the so y m il k ma g ic did n ' t work to day .
I will be sleep y when I ' m le aving .
C o ul d you tell me know how to sleep well ?
No w , I have to im p ro ve my English s k i ll because it is es s ent i al for the co ll e g e entrance ex a m in ation .
The co ll e g e that I want to ent er de m and s a very f le x i ble English s k i ll .
But study ing English for me is quiet hard so I can not write English sen t ence s f l u ent ly .
B y the way , I think it ' s very s il ly to le ar n another language just for pass ing an ex a m .
I can sha re with you some J a p an e se things if you write a commen t .
I will be glad if you will c or re c t my sen t ence s str ic t ly , because I re ally want to write in English natural ly .
A new se m est er !
To m or r ow a new se m est er will begin .
In a year and a half I will gradua te from co ll e g e .
I ' ve been study ing to take the I E L T S ex a m in M a y .
But one of my friend s think s I should take B E C first , and then finish the I E L T S in J u ly or A u g ust .
That ' s because the B E C is good for job hu n ting .
No w I have no idea what should I do .
C an you give me some suggest ion s , my de ar friend s ? I am re ally con f us ed now .
It was hard to set up before I could print out a p age .
It took long er than I expect ed .
I us ed to us e it easily .
B a c k then , it did n ' t take a long time before I could print it out .
It is ( or It ' s ) hard to keep up with new te ch no l o g y .
On ce it ' s he al ed , I can play hand b a ll ! !
And I left ho s p it al yesterday .
A c c id ent
I f e ll ( off ) by b ic y c le on my way home .
I have never f al le n ( off my ) s c o o ter ( , so ) it ( had ) been a long time since I ( had last ) hu r t myself .
How did the a c c id ent happen ? I was ri d ing along a ro ad but then the ro ad dis a p pe ar ed so I had to go over to a c ar ri age way . There was a small s te p , so I tri ed to s te p over it but I could n ' t since I was going kind of per p en d ic ul ar to the ro ad . T h us I end ed up t um b ling over it while I was still on the b ic y c le .
I gra z ed my k ne es and el b ow s and also had a f e w b l u e - black b r u is es .
( However , in ) some way , I think I was l u c k y ( ; it ) could be w or se .
I am glad there was no c ar s coming from behind me .
I re m e m b er when I was little , I hu r t myself in ex a c t ly the same way .
A b ic y c le is da ng er ous .
My b ic y c le ' s hand le b ar b ent , so I had to keep it ( di a g on al ) to keep going straight .
The w ound is not too bad ( , but ) I was a b it e m b ar r as s ed .
Even the small s te p s s c ar ed me ( , even though ) I was ri d ing very care ful ly .
It has been a long time since I last w ro te an ent ry but now I ' m here again .
I stop p ed le ar n ing K or e an a f e w week s a g o
The se past days I re al i z ed that I should just f o c us on my English !
I ' m try ing to f i g ur e out what ' s wrong with my English .
F or the past f e w week s I have been f re qu ent ing a we b s ite called O m e g le .
It ' s a we b s ite that let s you talk to strange r s at r and o m .
It help s me understand what my c ur r ent English le ve l is .
I can not understand n at ive English speak er s yet .
I think they us e a l ot of s la ng in their con ver s ation s .
D o you think that talk ing to them could im p ro ve my English s k i ll s ?
So I know No r th K or e a has been ma k ing n u c le ar we a p on !
And I watch ed on T V that U S j o ur n al is t s have been de tain ed in No r th K or e a .
D id n ' t they know the sit u ation there ?
J o ur n al is t s that go to da ng er ous place s are so c r a z y , even though there is po s s i b il ity of d y ing .
I respect them , but I will never go to w ar z on e !
W i ll it be K or e a or J a p an ?
O r are they bra ve enough to at ta c k the U S direct ly ?
A n y way no country is interest ed in the P h il i p p in es , so . . . .
What a pe a ce ful world we have here !
I heard that there are p ir ate s in the P h il i p p in es , and that they kid n a p people and k i ll them .
M a y b e b and it s too .
I think he live s in my house . . .
`` You have your who le life a head of you ``
That is one person ' s w or d s I just got when I as k something about life a little while a g o .
I some time feel in se c ur e about my way s if I should get things going or not .
I kind of he s it ate .
In that time , some on e ga ve me a s up p or t ive small push in right way .
I wish I could become like that some day .
I went to the l i b r ar y near my comp an y ' s office , d ur ing l un ch time .
I read some ma g a z in es , which were about fashion , money , mo ter c y c le and so on .
This l i b r ar y is the big g est in my c ity , with so many b ook s in there .
I found this b ook on ' A m a z on ' we b s ite , so I want to r ent the b ook tomorrow .
Yes ter day I me t a friend who st ud ies law at my un ive r s ity .
He called me on the p h on e when I was eat ing l un ch on c amp us .
In the after no on , we me t at a c a f e in front of S st ation near my un ive r s ity .
He seemed to want some on e he could talk to without any con st r a in t .
L a w is not my f i el d , but soon I re al i z ed I ' m interest ed in it , es pe c i ally when he talk ed about the re l ation s h i p between c ri m in al law and p s y ch i at ry .
He looked like he was enjoy ing himself in talk ing about this matter .
It see m s that high school was n ' t that long a g o . T h o se ha p p y moment s o c c ur to me all the time .
I was like , `` What if I could stay at that time for ever ? `` But I know my mind now has change d a l ot .
And I would n ' t have thought I would go this far .
A ll I ' m think ing now is how I can get a good , pro m is ing job , im p ro ve myself , so c i al i z e with other people and im p ro ve my English , es pe c i ally spoke n English .
And I think it ' s been quite a long time since I ' ve po st ed any English ar t ic le on this we b s ite , and it might be the be st time for me to p r a c t ic e my second language by us ing L an g - 8 .
I will for ce myself to write something in English every day .
T h an k you ! !
I ' m going to speak about myself in English at 1 0 P M .
So , I will write what I ' m going to say .
I ra n a full mar a th on two week s a g o .
It was n ' t the T O K Y O mar a th on .
I have been talk ing with my friend s on S k y pe l ate ly .
I ' m re ally glad I j o in ed this gr o up .
I felt bad because I am not us ed to accept ing ex p en s ive g if t s from people .
In the morning and at night , t w ic e !
I was re ally tired and f e ll down .
I re m e m b er my teacher told us this when I was a high school st ud ent , he said : `` H a p p i ness is when you like your work . `` I did n ' t understand at that time .
I thought I would n ' t do anything if I dis like d it .
As most C h in e se students , I sp ent too much time to study ing for the un ive r s ity entrance ex a m in ation .
L u c k i ly , I entered a good un ive r s ity and after gradua tion , I got a job in a comp an y .
But the pro ble m is , I do n ' t like my work .
I never tri ed to do anything be s id es le ar n ing for the ex a m .
I do n ' t even know what I re ally like .
So my co w or k er and I went to b ar r a k s to c he c k two of the room s .
It was ho r ri ble .
The f il th y room s are c le an now .
It is hot in J a p an to day .
V er y hot for me .
To day ' s me n u is f ry mi n c ed me at with ri ce and s un n y - side up !
As you know , the B r u in s w on the S t an le y C up this year !
The end of the p ar ad e ro ut e was in C op le y S qu ar e , and I got to be there .
When I ar ri v ed at C op le y , I ' d never see n such a t re m en d ous am o un t of people there .
I thought all the people in B o st on came down t ow n yesterday .
To make matter s w or se , the we a ther was so hot . . .
This was my first time watch ing a p ar ad e in B o st on , and even though I ' m not a big ic e - ho c ke y f an , it was a w es ome .
I ho pe that the Red So x will be the w in n er of the W or l d S er ies , so then I ' ll have a ch ance to watch a p ar ad e again !
H i , my name is No r m a .
I ' m le ar n ing English and J a p an e se .
I ' d like to im p ro ve my s k i ll s by us ing la ng - 8 .
M a y b e I ' ll make mistake s for the first time ,
but if I try more and more ,
I ' ll have good English . ^ ^
My first di ar y ent ry .
H i , This is the first time I ' m writing a di ar y on la ng - 8 .
I would like to im p ro ve my English for the future !
I have never st ud i ed history since j un i or high school .
I felt as ha m ed because I know less about J a p an e se history than my A m er ic an friend s .
I think that many you ng J a p an e se do n ' t know about their history .
We do n ' t know about own country ' s and for e i g n co un t ri es ' .
A l th ough it take s 5 hour s to go / get to H i ro s h im a , I ' m very ex cited .
E at ing L o c al F o o d
I ' m ha p p y that I at e most of the things I tri ed in A m s ter d a m .
Yes ter day I was give n l ot s of e m a il s by my friend s and present s by my p ar ent s .
A fter that , I went to a c r a m school .
S in ce I had been so la z y the se last f e w days , the class seemed to be difficult .
I can not wait for that .
I ' m start ing L an g - 8 !
I ' m 2 5 and a me d ical st ud ent at 5 th gra d e .
D o es any body know To t t or i ?
To day I read a ma g a z in e in which L an g - 8 was in t ro d u c ed .
I want to im p ro ve my English , and I will start it to day .
I do n ' t know how to us e this .
It is so difficult that I ' m dis a p po in ted .
But to a ch ive my dr e a m s , I still have to study hard .
To day , when I was sleep ing in the after no on I had a bad dr e a m .
It was very ter ri ble .
I was so s c ar ed that it w o ke me up .
H a p p y V al ent in e ' s D a y
T r a ve l p l an going to the E a st co a st
My p l an is to go to the E a st co a st ; because , I have never been there and the are as I want to visit are N e w Y or k , W ash ing t on D .
C . and F l or id a .
I gue s s it would take more than a week if I will visit all the f a m ous to ur is t sp ot s in those are as and I ' m not sure whether I could take a va c ation more than a week .
So , I might give up visit ing some sp ot s .
A n y way , I have to re se ar ch how long I need to go around each l o c ation , I want to go and then de c id e the d ur ation of the tri p .
I me t a lady who had something gr e y .
She told us if we to u ch ed it we would be ha p p i er .
So many people want ed to to u ch it , we even had to wait for a while .
There were about three hu n d r ed of people ( there wait ing ) .
She made it us ing a to w el which she b ough t at a one hu n d r ed yen sh op .
D o you know what `` U n a g i no b or i `` mean s in J a p an e se ?
If you to u ch `` U n a e , `` you will soon become l u c k y .
A c t u ally , she has been l u c k y since she made `` U n a e `` .
( because , ) she can me e t many people and talk to g e ther .
If you want to know about `` U n a e , `` please visit this sit e .
I he a v ed her o ' s a d u e t I heard her o ' s d u e t ? ? ? ?
The m us ic is re ally f ant a st ic !
This m us ical feel s similar to the mo v i e M o ul in R o u g e .
It was b ri ll i ant and sen s ation al .
It ' s a l o ve story , d ur ing the w ar , between a hu r ted pro st it ut e and a so l d i er who has to fight .
It en s in a tra g ed y with the her o in es s u ic id e .
He ar t - str ic k en their l o ve made me she d tea r s .
To day is ra in y day so I sp ent it watch ing a mo v i e .
What do you do on a day like this ?
I ' ll want to c le an my room after the mo v i e end s .
I am going to sp en d my day at home .
No w a day s dis c i p line from teachers to students in school s are said to have l o o s en ed up .
I es c a p ed from the co l d .
but now I have a head a ch e .
and I took out some e c on o m ic b ook s from the l i b r ar y .
To m m or ow I will have to study English and e c on o m ic s .
W o ul d you please tell me what is the natural way to as k some on e for a favor , es pe c i ally when some on e has a question , like what I am do ing .
C he c k ing a l ot of for um s about English us age , I not ic ed that many question er s a d d a than k s p h r a se at the end of their question s , like , `` T h an k s in a d v ance for your help , `` or just `` T h an k s . `` J a p an e se usual ly do n ' t speak in this manner , but in s te ad we us e a different for m of p h r as es to finish a request for a favor .
T h an k s in a d v ance for your help .
I took part in a job in ter v i e w this morning , but after the H R kept as k ing me question s for about 3 0 minute s , she told me may b e this position does n ' t f it for me because I do n ' t have the S Q L s k i ll .
I was wonder ing why she did n ' t as k me if I have the S Q L s k i ll in the p h on e call last week .
I have two job in ter v i e w s to go to tomorrow .
One is in the morning , and the other is in the after no on .
I us e the i P ad for read ing b ook s and watch ing D V D s like F R I E N D S .
I can also con ne c t to the In ter ne t any where and any time .
But , it is a p ity that the i P ad is he a v y for me .
I ' m look ing for w ar d and wait ing for what the A p p le will b r ing
This c ity is called ' M us ic c ity . ' I ' m talk ing about N ash v il le .
This is the M e c c a of country m us ic .
A l ot of country m us ic star s come from here .
I came here a f e w days a g o , and I found this c ity is full of m us ic .
F or ex amp le , there are m us ic bo x es ( j u ke b o x es ) along the street ; and there are a l ot of b ar s open at l un ch time , and they have good live m us ic .
I re ally want to go to the b ar s and listen to re al country m us ic , but I ' m as ha m ed to go inside by myself .
B e f or e I leave here , I have to try .
I came here to le ar n English .
I ' m not sure how I can sp en d 3 more week s here .
are get ting better
I made a light er re ally hot from the f i re of the light er and p re s s ed the light er on my s k in to make a smile y face .
It hu r t , but after w ar d s it was o k : )
My bo y f ri en d told me about the smile y face , ( I did n ' t know n about it before ) but he was w or ri ed about me when I did them .
So I will not do any new one s .
B y the way , they don t look like smile y face s ,
I think it ' s because I us ed a J a p an e se light er
so they do n ' t smile ! : o
but I do n ' t mind ~
A n y way s , I have not been study ing English re c ent ly ,
I should ! ! ! !
A b ir th day part y is going to be he l d in my so n ' s n ur se ry school this T h ur s day .
I will go to the part y and say a f e w w or d s of ce le b r ation to him .
My hand s are it ch ing to write about this !
E ver y on e has a favor ite an im al and so do I .
My mother is all er g ic to c at s so she is n ' t a ' ' c at person ' ' .
A l th ough my mother did n ' t like c at s , and still she does n ' t , she agree d with the idea to look after the c at for a f e w days .
I know it , my father has no sen se of original ity !
I was watch ing T V while dr in k ing some hot ch o c o l ate , y um y um y um !
I heard some c r a c k ing sound s a b o ve my head .
Well , old house s some time s make no is e when you walk .
C at s always l and on their feet , p he w !
When I was tak ing the piece s of in s ul ation ma ter i al off her , I had to laugh about my c l um s y c at !
I laugh ed and said : You ' re a ha ir y , o b e se id i ot !
My c at is n ' t the s l im m est c at around ( She we i g h s 5 k il o ' s o _ 0 ) , so the th in p l ate s could n ' t s up p or t her we i g h t .
( B y the way , I did n ' t know what to call the ce il ing .
I ' m s ad because I con t in u e to be ter ri ble in English .
I always try to write something but I have difficult y because of I do n ' t have some on e to c or re c t me .
I ' m afraid to write something wrong in face b ook and have people laugh .
English is not difficult but I con t in u e to have a small v o c a b ul ar y .
I took money from my pocket but it was 93 0 yen , so I was going to pay 1 1 0 yen from a my point c ar d from this came r a sh op but I was short 1 0 yen , so I had to give up on bu y ing one pack but I re ally want ed to bu y one more .
A ll the work er s were surprise d that I found 1 0 0 yen .
I have 6 days left unti l my T O E F L i B T t est . . .
I ' ll be tak ing the t est for the first time and this t est is re ally im p or t ant for me . . .
If I can get a certain s c or e , I can go to am er ic a to study for a year us ing an ex change st ud ent pro g r a m of my un ive r s ity .
But , it see m s very difficult for me , so I am almost los ing my con f id ence now . . .
It ' s no us e comp la in ing now . . .
I should have st ud i ed hard er d ur ing my w in ter ho l i day . ( > _ < )
This week , I re m e m b er ed 6 0 new w or d s
by study ing the S T E P p re - 1 st gra d e .
I have enough time to write ( p r a c t ic e ? ) new w or d s .
But I want to con t in u e study ing English every day .
B as ic ally , the comp ut er ' s op er ation is C U I .
One of my dr e a m s is to be the e ng en e er of F or m ul a One .
However I have now los t as s ur ance ( ho pe ? ) of it .
The teacher want ed to mar k his students ' English comp o s i tion s on the b as is of the natural ness of their English , in or d er to e v al u ate how much they have us ed the language .
H a p p y day !
To day , my very funny class made me ex t re m e ly ha p p y .
In fact , they always make me ha p p y .
One of my go al s is to co m m un ic ate with n at ive English speak er s without any o b st a c le s .
So , please do n ' t he s it ate to re v is e my poor English , even if it ' s a ti n y ti n y mistake , mi s us e , or n u ance pro ble m .
I believe there are kind people in this on line co m m un ity and I ho pe they will help me im p ro ve my English s k i ll s . .
I ' m study ing like this .
To day , I had a ch ance to speak English .
I think it is better to le ar n con ver s ation and know our c ul ture s than v o c a b ul ar y le ar n ing .
So I want to watch mo v ies but it ` s too ex p en s ive for me . . .
To day I thought about po st ing a v id e o from a F re n ch mo v i e , in which a scene take s place in H ar le m .
So the pro ta g on is t s speak English of course , and every body can understand the v id e o ; I do n ' t need to tra n s c ri b e or to tra n s l ate .
I ' ll in t ro d u ce the mo v i e a little : The mo v i e take s place in the 1 9 8 0 s ; it ' s a F re n ch come d y as they were very p op ul ar in F r ance .
The ma in character is play ed by M i ch el C o l u c c i a . k . a C o l u ch e , a very p op ul ar F re n ch come d i an and act or .
In this mo v i e , the pro ta g on is t ( C o l u ch e ) works for an in s ur ance so c i e ty and has to tra ve l around the world to b r ing back to F r ance un l u c k y to ur is t s who have un f or t un ate ly had pro ble m s or a c c id ent s .
T h us , in the mo v i e , C o l u ch e tra ve l s around the world , and ex pe ri ence s some a d ve n ture s in va ri ous co un t ri es such as M or o c c o , The United - States ( H ar le m ) , C h in a and so on . . .
It ' s one of my favor ite F re n ch come d ies ; I still laugh each time I watch it , even at this very moment writing the ent ry and listen ing to the ex c er p t at the same time .
I think it may be interest ing to listen to the F re n ch a c c ent and the ( may b e ex a g g er at ed ) view of H ar le m by the F re n ch at the time .
The man say s that N e w Y or k is very da ng er ous and w ar n s C o l u ch e to be care ful , es pe c i ally of black people who at ta c k w h ite s .
C o l u ch e , who was not afraid before he me t the man , is now very ten se and afraid . . .
And as k s him to go to H ar le m , but even the black tax i - dr ive r re f us es to go there and leave s him close to the dis t ri c t .
And the as the v id e o begin s we see him walk ing on the de s er ted street s of H ar le m .
and is surprise d to see that this same man is in b and age s and a p p ar ent ly in j ur ed .
He as k s him what happen ed , and the answer is that the man has been at ta c k ed ( if I re m e m b er c or re c t ly , I think that he was even at ta c k ed by w h ite me n . . .
W h i ch is funny as he only w ar n ed about black s ) .
I suppose it ' s because I work ed in the co l d st or e yesterday .
When we have a co l d , eat ing and sleep ing well is the be st for us .
My f a v o ur ite sea s on is s um m er , but not when it ' s very hot .
No w in R us s i a it is s um m er and it ' s a w ful ly hot ! ! ! We go to the ri ver almost every day , but even bath ing does n ' t re l i e ve me from the he at ! I never im a g in ed that I would ho pe it would be w in ter now .
W in ter I l o ve too , but if you want to go for a walk in this sea s on / w in ter , you have to to we ar many / a l ot of c l o th es ! ! A ut um n . . .
I ha te a ut um n ! It of ten ra in s , which is why you c a n ' t go for a walk .
It is n ' t so hot , the gra s s and leave s are gr e en , the b ir d s are s ing ing . . .
I ' m a c c ust ome d to s um m er ' s he at and l o ve it be st of all !
I have to go to my office at the same time as usual after a he a v y s n ow f a ll .
I also have to sh o ve l s n ow around my house , c ar p ar k s and office . . .
In addition to this , tra f f ic is so c r ow d ed . . .
I just started this S N S .
I think this is good to im p ro ve my English s k i ll s .
I have been study ing English for a f e w year s , but my English writing and speak ing is still not good , so I want to le ar n n at ive English on L an g - 8 ( ^ _ ^ ) /
It ' s the first s un n y day in a while .
S un s h in e make s me ha p p y and give s me en er g y .
But a high hu m id ity make s me feel he a v y and s te al s my v it al ity .
I ho pe that f a ll in J a p an will come as soon as possible !
I like going s n ow b o ar d ing d ur ing the w in ter , even though I ' m not very a th l etic .
I went s n ow b o ar d ing the past two S at ur day s : - )
The f in al st age was so difficult that I tri ed ha d to try it 2 0 time s in or d er t o so l ve it : - P But I have a l ot of st age s which is not so l v ed , so I have to try them la ter .
N a g an o , J a p an
I would l o ve to see a mo un tain .
I want to live in the country s id e in the future .
Some time s when I take a walk with my do g , I feel a side w o k is da ng er ous because of b ic y c le s .
In J a p an , we have the r ul e that de f in es a b ic y c le as a kind of c ar that has ri s k .
But some people who ri d e b ic y c le s do n ' t know or understand it s ri s k .
I some time s watch ed on T V that there are ro ad s for b ic y c le s in P ar is .
I ho pe that my c ity also p re p ar es b ic y c le ' s ro ad s for s a f e ty .
A fter 1 0 days , we will take an ex a m about e ng l ish .
It is very im p or t ant and very f a m ous if you do n ' t pass it , you w on t get a s u it able job in C h in a .
It is for co ll e g e students .
P e op le who have already gradua ted can also take this ex a m , so that make s this ex a m more comp e t it ive .
But act u ally , people may have the ability to pass it , but they still c a n ' t co m m un ic ate well in English .
I pass ed it half a year a g o , but writing pass age s are still re ally hard . . .
No w , I can f in ally c ook D A K D O R I !
The whether was not very co l d this morning , not like it ty p ic ally is in S w ed en .
S p r ing is co m m ing !
A n y way , I had to c ook l un ch for the next 3 days .
I had some ch i k en and I want ed to c ook D a k d or i which I had at te m ted three time s before and f a il ed !
F or t un ate ly , now I have a b ook which my mo m sen t me which is about K or e an f o o d .
D a k d or i was just one the re c i pe s includ ed in the b ook under the ch ic k en me n u .
A fter 3 0 minute s my k it ch en was a little di r ty but the ta s te was f ant a st ic !
I was very pro ud of myself .
No w I can show this to my friend s who are e age r to eat k or e an f o o d .
ha ha ha
I have to go to the office right now !
I over s l ept .
I work hard every day .
I am re ally look ing for w ar d to it .
On ce or t w ic e a year our c l u b play s ma t ch es against other sen i or so c c er tea m s . or another sen i or so c c er tea m
We also help each other in both our public and p ri v ate live s .
my name ' s A b d o . I ' m for ty year s old and I am new here .
I want to make friend s .
There were two ty pe s of for e i g n er s who were in J a p an before the e ar th qu a ke happen ed .
Some for e i g n er s in J a p an went back to their home co un t ri es .
However , it is found that Tokyo may be a s a f e are a this week , so they are try ing to come back to J a p an .
I he ar that when they come back to J a p an , they will have pro ble m s .
O ther work er s in their comp an y who did not leave and con t in u ed to work may be a ng ry .
In fact , they im po s ed their work on other work er s , but I think s a f e ty is the most im p or t ant thing and they should be we l c ome d back to their comp an y .
A r and o m thought on ( or : about ) en er g y
While I was re se ar ch ing al ter n at ive en er g y for a five minute s speech , a thought o c c ur r ed to me .
It is ne ce s s ar y that we de ve l op al ter n at ive en er g y .
In c a p it al is m , it is in e v it able that al ter n at ive en er g y will be us ed for pro f it s
I think what we need now is not to g en er ate more en er g y , but to con s um e less en er g y .
In mo d er n so c i e ty , es pe c i ally in ur b an life , we have become too depend ant on en er g y .
F or ex amp le , when I come home after work , I us e water and ga s en er g y to take a show er .
I s ur f the in ter ne t with an a ir - condition er and a f an turn ed on . A fter s ur f ing the we b I watch T V with the desk - to p still on and us e a st o ve and mi c r ow a ve to have a me al .
B e f or e going to be d , I usual ly read a b ook listen ing to m us ic , unless I go to the p u b .
I went through a black o ut once d ur ing my stay in the P h il i p p in es .
I re al i z ed then how much I depend on en er g y .
D ar k ness made me a fool who could n ' t do anything at all .
I was just sit ting in front of my la p t op in dark ness
N e x t thing I know , it was night time .
So I went outside
I could n ' t do anything .
electronic de v ic es that had n ' t been re ch ar g ed were us e less such as a la p t op , t v , m p 3 play er , even the re f ri g er at or .
A ll I could do was dr in k be er going s ta le in the re f ri g er at or .
F o s s il f u el is limit ed
There f or e , we will de ve l op al ter n at ive en er g y some day .
But the en er g y it s el f will be me re ly a co m m o d ity . To be b ough t or so l d in c a p it al is m .
We also made c ar b on d y x id e a co m m o d ity . We even bu y and se ll the right of e mission .
I think it ' s im po s s i ble for s us tain able de ve l op ment to be re al i z ed .
The conc ept of s us tain able de ve l op ment must have been made by c a p it al is t s who want ed to le g it a m i z e de ve l op ment and ex p l o it ation .
There is al re e ad y enough de ve l op ment and ex p l o it ation .
U n less we do , we will be at ta c k ed by nature with c l im ate change
B e c a us e the a ir p la ne was so e ar ly , I f a ll as le e p while the p la ne was f ly ing .
When I w o ke up , I heard a sound like g la s se s f al ling to the floor .
I re al i z ed that it was my g la s se s , but I could not see where they were after re a ch ing around for a while .
al th ough I even did not know him
He was very friend ly and help ed me find them ,
then I not ic ed he looked like a gentle man who was full of understand ing ,
the same age as me , and also we ar ing g la s se s .
A fter cha t ting for a while , we seemed to have a good impress ion of each other , because we enjoy ed our talk ing and we had a re ally n ic e time . I think we will be close friend s for life .
I think the o il sp i ll a c c id ent in the g ul f of me x ic o is a very im p or t ant thing in the world .
D e p en d ing on a case , I think it is more im p or t ant than e c on o m ic pro ble m s , re l i g ion , w ar , po ver ty , or any other pro ble m .
B e c a us e It affect s the who le world , no body know s a so l u tion , and no body can p r ed ic t what will happen .
But we hard ly he ar the new s about a c c id ent on T V in J a p an .
D o you guy s re ally speak like that ! ?
`` We st of the mo un tain s are b ro ad and f a ir ly f l at p la in s . ``
I can understand it s mean ing , but is it a w k w ar d for the English read er or listen er ?
English A g a in !
A fter an English le c ture , I tell myself over and over again : I must le ar n English now !
It look s re ally n ic e here .
I have sen t many me s s age s to strange r s who speak English .
I ho pe they ' ll re p ly .
I ha te English , because I have st ud i ed it for e i g h t year s , but I c a n ' t listen to a le c ture well , and I c a n ' t read an English paper well either .
I re ally need this we b s ite to im p ro ve my work .
So I ho pe English speak er s will become my friend s .
So I think it ' s me m or able to keep something down here . ( un c le ar )
I have to a d m it age is a becom ing more and more a sen s it ive is s u e as I get old er and old er , and the old er I get , the more respon s i b il ity come s along and the more ma ture you should be ha ve .
Well , I think I wish I could we l c ome the moment at home as usual , but I f a il ed for the last co up le of days which f l ash ed through so quick ly in a no r ther n c ity I have never been to before .
T r a ve ll ing make s the time e la p se so quick ly that I have hard ly any time to di g est the change of age sat is f a c t or i ly , Even though I have been able to come back home this morning , I still c a n ' t take my time and am act u ally str u g g ling to keep a w a ke to di g est it as much as I can , because I hard ly s l ept yesterday .
D o n ' t tell other s , o k a y ?
- D a i k on - O ro s h i is gra ted J a p an e se ( w h ite ) ra d ish .
He got a ng ry and s w un g his k it ch en k n if e ( at her ) , but his d aught er re s is ted / block ed with her can e and es c a p ed .
And then the police c aught him in the act .
He said `` My d aught er at e my D a i k on - O ro s h i from the re f ri g er at or without my per mission , so I got up se t ,
I did n ' t re ally / act u ally in ten d to k i ll her . It was just a th re at . . . ``
My new friend s who come from U S A .
I was suppose to very n er v ous , because my English is n ' t well , I was afraid that I could n ' t express my English well .
That ' s right . I should be about to b re a k through myself .
To day is my ho l i day .
J a p an has a ho l i day called `` B on va c ation `` .
D o you know what is B on va c ation ?
M o st of the people are on ho l i day d ur ing B on va c ation .
B on va c ation is the day of w or s h i p ing our ance st or .
But I was on d ut y d ur ing the B on va c ation .
There f or e I took to day off as an al ter n at ive to B on va c ation .
O ur comp an y is all about tra d ing .
There are many things we ex p or t , es pe c i ally f o o d s .
My bo s s went off the comp an y proper ty at one moment .
I got re ally hung ry .
I want to have a b an an a .
In the picture show n a b o ve .
It is a s amp le that we se ll .
But it look s re ally n ic e and s m e ll s good .
My bo s s always tell us , do n ' t eat the s amp le s because he has to us e it for show .
But I c a n ' t be p at i ent .
When I first had sp a g he t t i in the U K , I found it ter ri ble .
It was bo il ed for too long and too so f t for me .
M or e o ver , I still did n ' t like it when I b ough t a can of sp a g he t t i ( can n ed sp a g he t t i ) and had it because it was like j el ly , and was es s ent i ally just a can of me at s a u ce .
In the far e aster n country J a p an , we did n ' t know al de n te in the past .
We have tra d i tion al noodle s , U d on and So b a , which are b as ic ally bo il ed to their co re .
However , we now know that it ' s far better to have sp a g he t t i in that way .
Why is n ' t al de n te that co m m on in this E ur o pe an country who se people are the most o m n i v or ous ?

I made a t w it ter account .

I know it ' s re ally just a small thing , but I feel like this ti n y ga p de f in ite ly ex is t s .
As you may know , I ' m the kind of person who is so ' easy ' .
B e ing easy is a good point , but it make me w an n a di e .
I do n ' t know how to es c a pe from this guy I have live d as for 2 2 year s .
The thing I re ally ha te is having a p r ed ic t able future .
There is no op tion , I have to us e this ch ance .
I can stay here only 3 more month s .
How can I understand it ? G ive me more i nformation .
K or e a has a very tra g ic mo d er n history .
The c a p it al is t side and the co m m un is t side b ro ke out into w ar .
To day , I found this new s ar t ic le .
No r th K or e a began a large con st r u ction pro j e c t in P y on g y an g .

T h an k you !
In s te ad of re p ly ing each , I ( will ) than k you all for c or re c ting this di ar y .

J a p an has a big pro ble m since we / it had a big e ar th qu a ke ,
so I have to end ur e many things because many people s u f f er .
I feel that sp r ing has ar ri v ed here over night , for the simple reason that the te m p er a ture in re c ent days has ri s en to 2 0 de g re e d ur ing the day .
however , there was he a v y s n ow on the 1 2 th of A p ri l last year and the s n ow re m a in ed unti l the end of that month .
but so far , there is only a little part of s n ow left in the corner , where it is she l ter ed from the s un sh in ing direct ly on it d ur ing the day .
A ccord ing to the l o c al s , they have even ex pe ri ence d s n ow in M a y when they were you ng er .
now the we a ther is becom ing more and more ex t re m e .
I b ough t a new la p t op to day because my P C b ro ke .

I will take an English less on on S k y pe this week en d .
But just now I tri ed to he ar my voice on S k y pe , and it sound ed bad .
I ' m w or ri ed if I can take the less on s m o o th ly this week en d .
I want to write my pro f i le first .
I listen to [ the G a z e t te ] and [ Ka la f in a ] .
And I like L o l it a fashion !
T h an k you for read ing !
The p ri m ar y reason that I watch ed this mo v i e because I just want ed to re la x for a little b it after I knew we still could n ' t get the an n u al bo n us again this year .
P l us , the mo v i e scene s could n ' t be better .
This mo v i e is talk ing about two different A m er ic an girl s who sp ent their s um m er in B ar ce l on a , where they have a ro man t ic , un f or g e t t able a d ve n ture .
M e an w h i le , they are still le ar n ing how to face some is s u es in their live s .
This mo v i e ' s spirit see m s give us the idea that everything is possible , es pe c i ally re la ting to l o ve .
When it come s to the sub j e c t of l o ve , some people ten d to be re al is t ic , some people are always expect ing something very different .
I can understand how it feel s when people want to cha se , and find something in their life , but do n ' t know what ex a c t ly is the purpose .
There f or e , what ever what kind of life we want , it ' s our ch o ic e .
But I think most people in our country , we do n ' t have enough co ur age to change the sit u ation , or some time s we just c ar ry more mo r al respon s i b il ity .
O ur sp a ce was near the sea and the st ation , and when I ar ri v ed , there were some friend s .
( While we wait ed for the start of the f i re w or k s show , we at e and dr an k . would be more natural . )
We had been tired , but when we watch ed them , we for g ot our f at i gue .
The f i re w or k s were the most beautiful which I had watch ed ever .
P le a se watch them with my picture s ^ ^ In fact , they were more beautiful ! !
A l s o , I w or e a y u k at a for a long time so I was ha p p y .
I ' ll talk about what is f un .
It is f un to watch my favor ite T V pro g r a m s .
So when I come home about all pro g r a m s I want to watch have already finish ed .
So , I re c or d pro g r a m s to my B l u - ra y dis k .
In the follow ing days I ' ll write about my favor ite pro g r a m s .
Some un ive r s ity students find they be ne f it from part - time work while other s say that work ing even part - time would p re v ent them from ma k ing the most of their st ud ies . D is c us s the me ri t s of both ar g u ment s . With which point of view do you agree with in regard to your country and why ?
Some students need to find job s for living , but other s have a ch o ic e if they work or not for ex t r a money .
A l s o some of them say work would be an o b st a c le for their study .
But I agree with that students do part - time work even in J a p an .
So they do not need to work , though they still need some ex t r a money for c l o th es , da ting and so on .
I think there are f e w students who work for living co st s like f o o d , r ent , ut il ity b i ll s .
That s why it see m s like an un ne ce s s ar y ex pe ri ence .
C o op er ation s k i ll s are very im p or t ant , so if they w o n ' t do any job while they are st ud ent , after gradua tion they may face some difficult y such re la ted with so c i al and co p ing s k i ll s in the future .
A l s o they would know how time is p re c i ous and en h ance their time man age ment s k i ll s .
In conc l us ion , part - time job s are be ne f ic i al but students should n ' t sp en d too much time for a little ex t r a money .
I heard new s that one of the old est and most f a m ous re st a ur ant s in R ome was p un ish ed with s us p en tion of their business op er ation because they dis h on est ly charge d a J a p an e se co up le about 7 0 0 E ur o s for l un ch .
They could not speak It al i an or English , so their J a p an e se hotel own er went to the police st ation with them to claim the money back .
I was surprise d that they had pai d with their credit c ar d !
If I were them , I would make a comp la in t in English any way .
But they might have th re a ten ed me or p re ten d ed to not understand English . . . .
What could I do ? ? ?
P ' P un suggest ed this sit e to me and I re ally a p p re c i ate him . .
ha ha ho pe he does n ' t see this .
there are some things that we need to re m e m b er , while there are some things that we need to for g e t , and ha d better not re m e m b er again .
I ' m try ing to for g e t some body who was just a gue st in my life , they just live d in my past life .
they will not come again .
tea r s can get people ' s sympath y , and c an make me feel good , but I do n ' t like it .
tea r s show that I am we a k , I am n ever will ing for other people to see me c ry ing .
the me m or y of the se un ha p p y things will dis a p pe ar with time .
It ' s M a y now , but it is too hot .
To day , we had a V ER Y long meeting . . .
It was over 2 hour s , and it was so b or ing that many of us s l ept : - P
A fter that , I tri ed to f i x a bu g on my so f t w ar e .
I had go o g led for 3 or 4 hour s and f in ally I found a so l u tion and f i x ed the bu g ! !
It see m s that there is no i nformation in J a p an e se about the bu g , so if I have time , I will write an ar t ic le about that .
We live our every day live s us ing clock s .
We us e them when we get up in the morning , go to work , to go back home , and go to be d at night .
But I of ten dr e a m of a life without clock s .
I think that it might be a ri ch er kind of life . ( ? )
My bo s s go es on a off ic i al to ur to day .
So
I am free in the mo r in ing .
But the t est is next week .
B y the way , I s there the dr i ll for e ar th qu a ke s ?
, E ar th qu a k ed ri ll s happen more than f ir ed ri ll s in J a p an , because J a p an has many e ar h qu a ke s .
There is an express ion in J a p an e se .
`` e ar th qu a ke s , thunder , f ir es , father s ``
The se are all s c ar y .
If there are mistake s in my sen t ence s , please tell me .
A ccord ing to the we a ther for e c a st it ' s going to s n ow tomorrow .
I think w in ter is sure ly coming soon .
I ' m p l an n ing to go to S a p po ro ( the c a p it al of H o k k a id o , J a p an ) this week en d and I feel un e as y about going through the pass because it ' s very da ng er ous to dr ive on ic y ro ad s .
A c t u ally , I ' ve never go ne through the pass d ur ing this time of the year .
I ho pe that nothing bad will happen .

I made some mistake s but every on e ex c ept for my father said it was good .
E ver y on e was very ( kind .
My father , however , said `` O h , this mo ch i is re ally hard like a stone . `` as soon as he at e it .
While I c ook ed , he was just sleep ing .
He should have help ed or just said nothing .
S in ce F ri day , when ever I turn ed on A / C , a we ir d and loud no is e come s from the front part of the c ar , where the e ng in e is l o c at ed .
But , I still could he ar very a in ter r up ting and worry ing no is e from A / C .
To m or r ow is S un day , so I do n ' t think they will be open .
I ho pe it w o n ' t co st me a l ot .
I will po st a picture of S po t tomorrow with some writing . R i g h t now , I ' m so tired and want to go sleep .
I feel so tri ed . I had to finish my home w or k , but I think I will be able to finish my home w or k by the end of this ho l i day .
However , my p ar ent s do n ' t agree . They think I will sp en d my time le ar n ing something s else .
So much work . I can I finish it all .
I have de c id ed to go on a di e t .
I went to G u an g z h o u a f e w days a g o , and in t ro d u c ed some kind s of di m s um to a S ha ng ha i friend .
She l o v ed it so much .
My favor ite kind of di m s um is l i us ha b a o co l d c a ke , and ch ic k en feet !

M a y b e try other s if you do n ' t da re to try ch ic k en feet !
I want ed to be friend s ( with her ) , but I could n ' t .
I was sh y and could n ' t find a reason to talk with her .
My bo y f ri en d and I are going to a sh ri ne to p r a y for our he al th for this year .
We are sp en d ing a very re la x ing time on our ho l i day .
I wish I can take good care of our family f in an c i al man age ment .
I get a part of our s aving s to in ve st in the st ock mar ke t .
So , if I have free time s I conc er n st ock mar ke t i nformation .
When ever I think about job - hu n ting , I feel so o o o an x i ous .
I want to be a ch il d for ever . . .
I s this P e ter P an s y n d r ome ?
I think the de f in i tion of an a d ul t is different through o ut the world .
But may b e there are many co un t ri es that de f in e `` a d ul t `` at an e ar l i er age .
I ' m 1 8 year s old , so I could be consider ed an a d ul t in another country .
My comp le x ion is get ting better comp ar ed to other sea s on s .
That is mo s qu it o es .
D e ar mo s qu it o es , do you re ally think my b l o o d is more y um m y than other s ?

I am going to do something about it .
I do n ' t like to be a p ow er less v ic t im for the mo s qu it o es .
I ' m w re st ling with the idea s on how to pro te c t myself from them .
B as ic ally , it is said J a p an e se people are not good at speak ing English .
We begin to le ar n it in j un i or high s c o o l .
If we go to un ive r s ity , we are le ar n ing English for 1 0 year s .
My name is o an h ch a u . I ' m from V i e t n a m . My language is v i e t n ame se .
This is the first time I write a j o ur n al on the in ter ne t . A c t u ally my
e ng l ish is very bad , so now I am try ing to s ty d y e ng l ish hard
N e x t month I am p l an ing to get some re st at the s n ow y mo un tain s .
U n f or t un ate ly I could not do it d ur ing the new year ' s ce le b r ation s with my friend s because of my i ll ness .
But now , after the ex a m s I must have some fresh high l and a ir .
There is a s k i re s or t in my town , but to my re g re t I only got to know about it at last year .
O ver there s n ow b o ar d is the most P op ul ar , but I did not ch o se it for this reason .
I have ex pe ri ence d many year s in s k i ing , but I never s n ow b o ar d ed .
Well , I will wait for the end of this month and for good we a ther now .
The be st tra d i tion al per u v i an f o o d of all the place s I ' ve eat en at !
It ' s l o c at ed at 1 0 6 2 S an M ar t in A ve n u e , P u e b l o L i b re .
In particular , they have a good va ri e ty of great f o o d , a big me n u of tra d i tion al dis he s such as p a p a re ll en a , ce v ic he , but if ar r a . One of the most f a m ous is `` ch or it o s a la cha la c a `` .
The who le place is an old co l on i al bu il d ing !
I think it ' s one of the only place s in the c a p it al c ity that ma in tain s the se tra d i tion s .
In s id e of the re st a ur ant , you will see many picture s from the time when this place was under con st r u ction , picture s of our first mo n or a il , the first c ar s in per u , e t c .
The wait er s are a b it old , but they are re ally good .
I feel very p le as ant every time I go there . You find out about not only our f o o d but also a little b it about our history !
And there are a l ot of for e i g n er s going there as well .
The p ri ce is quite normal and I find it reason able since they c ook very well . .
I would like to re c o m m en d this re st a ur ant to all the to ur is t s who are coming to visit P er u . If you p l an to f i ll your st o m a ch with something tra d tion al , f a st , un i qu e and good from an an c i ent place like this , do n ' t he s is t ate and go find it out for your s el f .
I ' m w ri t ting my first po st , and I need to your help to ex p l or e my English .
My friend R a f a el , said in one of his last po st s , that he can on ly study in a per f e c t not e b ook .
He ' s a very funny guy , and I me e t him when we were on ly five year s old .
U n t il the start of this year , he was my class m ate , and he suggest ed this we b s ite to me .
In my point of view , it ' s a compli c ate we b s ite , but I think if I p r a c t ic e , I can us e so go o s this sit e , and f in ally re a ch my object ive .
I ' ll a p p re c i ate those w h o c or re c t my te x t , and than k s s s s s ( a l ot of `` S `` it ' s a in ter ne t for m or express ion that we us e a l ot on M S N , here in B r as il )
I sp ed up on the ro ad try ing to catch up to my friend ' s c ar .
I did not see that a police c ar was behind me .
I re al i z ed that was why every on e was dr i v ing so s l ow .
I es pe c i ally like watch ing E ur o pe an so c c er !
He D e f e at ed a B ul ly
When some bu ll ies walk ed up to him to bu l ly him yesterday , he s ud d en ly de f e at ed the bo s s of them with a p un ch to his st o m a ch .
H on est ly , I was glad to he ar this from my so n , and I am pro ud of him .
I think that my so n will have a more pe a ce ful school life for a while .
No w a day s I think about a l ot of things .
M a y b e the f in al t est is coming soon .
I took a ri d e on his mo t or c y c le .
He took me many place s that I ' ve never been .
R id ing a mo t or c y c le was not as s c ar y as I thought it would be .
I heard he has n ' t got a girl f ri en d .
To day I will me e t my friend s who study with me at un ive r s ity .
We will me e t at 6 P M .
M and dr in k some l i qu or .
I do n ' t think I ' ll return home to day .
I like to take home sick k it ten s to treat their i ll ness es .
M o st k it ten s are re ally sick and di e a f e w days la ter .
My c at is the only k it ten that has gr ow n to a d ul th o o d .
I want ed to a d op t him , but I do n ' t have enough sp a ce for two c at s .
I bath ed him every day because he had a th ic k la y er of f le as .
A fter a f e w days , his eyes were get ting better , but he was still th in .
This after no on , when I c he c k ed on how he was do ing , his bo x was e m p ty .
The house m a id said that he went to the ver and a , j um p ed from the second floor , and es c a p ed through the front ga te .
It see m s like s um m er is back .
The te m p er a ture in the day time is over 3 0 de g re es .
However , it is co o l er in the morning and even ing with a p le as ant a ut um n b re e z e .
We also feel a p le as ant b re e z e in the sha d e , even in the day time .
D ur ing the c y c ling tri p , I stop p ed at a l o c al public f a c il ity
where many t re k k er s were re st ing .
I wonder ed why so many people were walk ing there so I asked one of them .
She told me that this f a c il ity was one of the c he c k po in t s of the O x f a m T r a il w al k .
A c t u ally , the c he c k po in t I saw yesterday was the one for 8 0 k m .
She said that they were walk ing another 2 0 k m for the re st of the day .
This even t is also a f un d - ra is ing even t .
as they might f e ar the n u c le ar c ri s is and after s h ock s of the 3 . 1 1 e ar th qu a ke .
Some w or e T - shirt s on which en c o ur a g ing me s s age s for J a p an were written .
This is the four th time for her to part ic i p ate in the O ly m p ic s .
She was place d 7 th in her first O ly m p ic in N a g an o , J a p an , 6 th in S al t L a ke C ity , U S A and 5 th in To ri no , I ta ly .
This time , she had perform ed better than she had been and the other play er s , but she was place d only 4 th .
I was ho p ing this time she could w in a me d al . .
A fter her run , she said `` I f a il ed to get a me d al but I did try my be st . ``
That made me think that I should s up p or t her ever though I am not sure if she will con t in u e with mo g ul .
A n y w an y , I think it ' s going to be one ex c it ing O ly m p ic .
If you want to le ar n J a p an e se , I ' d be will ing to help as much as possible .
I enjoy the school f est i v al from O c t o b er 9 th to 1 1 th .
There was a conc er t , and I play ed the T ro m b on e .
M an y people came to watch our conc er t , so I was very ha p p y .
I think I will work very hard to p re p ar e for the next conc er t .
This time I w ro te easy and short sen t ence .
I will write long er and more difficult sen t ence s next time .
To day I had an English meeting with three re p re s ent at ive s of our comp an y , and c ust ome r s .
I me t three co ll e a gue s at the Tokyo st ation , then head ed to U t s un o m i y a st ation where we were going to me e t them .
I was a little n er v ous yesterday , so I called my mo m to as k her ( about ) the point s I have to keep in mind for the business meeting in English .
M o st J a p an e se do n ' t understand the b as ic conc ept of `` sha k ing hand s , `` She said .
A hu g e e ar th qu a ke and t s un a m i hi t my p re f e c ture
I could not believe my eyes when I saw it on T V .
I live in T ha il and now ,
So it is difficult to get p re c is e i nformation .
I went for a dr in k with my co ll e a gue and saw the B B C pro g r a m .
I saw , an at ro c i ous scene .
A large am o un t of c ar s , house s , and people were f l o at ing .
W a ll s and b i ll b o ar d s had f e ll .
The w or st thing is , the f o c us of the e ar th qu a ke was near my house .
My mother and s is ter still live there .
And a p ar t from them , my father and you ng er brother also are in the p re f e c ture .
There f or e , I tri ed to call them with my ce ll p h on e ,
I was so w or ri ed about them .
I could not stop sea r ch ing the in ter ne t for any i nformation .
U s ing sit es like ust re a m , t w it ter , and face b ook .
She said that they were all s a f e and are stay ing at home to g e ther now .
I felt a little re l i e v ed .
N u c le ar da m age is so ter ri ble .
A ll I can do is to p r a y for their s a f e ty .
To day I got a p h on e call from M r s . H u an g as k ing me to in ter v i e w with her comp an y .
It ' s the th ir d call so far , but I did n ' t go . ( yet ? )
Some time s I re g re t my de c is ion , but I have no way because of my st ud ies .
I did n ' t p re p ar e for it ent i re ly .
I do n ' t know how to dress for an in ter v i e w , how to de al with one , and how to answer hard question s .
No w I ' m con f us ed .
I ` m a co ll e g e st ud ent and I live in a dormitory .
The dormitory has a c ur f e w .
So even If I ` m hung ry , I c a n ' t go to a s up er m ar ke t to bu y f o o d when it is past c ur f e w .
However , I ` m hung ry now .
We went to b o g g an ing down a hi ll in my ne i g h b or h o o d .
It was my first time do ing it , al th ough I have s k i ed and s n ow b o ar d ed .
It was so s c ar y !
A t first I b r us h ed it off and thought it is was a sp or t for kid s .
It is like a ro ll er co aster .
The far ther we went , the f aster we went .
The sp e ed was out r age ous .
Besides that , I could n ' t con t ro l it well .
I act u ally str u c k a ch il d .
F or t un ate ly she was n ' t hu r t , but my mind went b l an k at that moment .
I a d m ir ed the ch il d re n because they had no f e ar .
I gue s s there are a l ot of op p or t un it ies to to b o g g an here and I have to im p ro ve my s k i ll s so as not to be be a ten by ch il d re n .
I got pretty / f a ir ly dr un k .
I will go to sleep e ar ly to day .
It is far more difficult than we think to be ha ve that way .
B e c a us e a re l ation s h i p require s co op er ation , listen ing to each other is very im p or t ant .
This also a p p l ies to da i ly con ver s ation s .
It was n ' t finish . It did n ' t finish .
I ' ll try next day . I ' ll try tomorrow .
he y ~ he ll o : D
this is an ne who keep s listen ing to 5 7 5 by per f um e ( j a p an e se ar t is t ) the se days .
first I went to V i ll age V an g u ar d which is a b ook st or e .
this is one of the most k a w a i i and us e ful b ook st or es I ' ve ever been to .
and I had a b an an a t ar t with c re a m and a c up of so y l at te .
I wish that place was a no n - s m o k ing place and
I wish I could stay a little b it long er .
( you have to or d er more if you want to stay there for over 2 hour s . . . )
and this is a kind of a b ook c a f e so
so there are many b ook s
I read the b ook about mo v i e qu ot es ( interest ing )
am a a a a a z in n ng and it made me c ry .
this is me and this is a day of an ot a ku - girl .
As you know , the e c on o m y sit u ation is get ting w or se , es pe c i ally the c ar in d ust ry includ ing U S and K or e a .
I have to s a ve money if I w an n a bu y a c ar . . . ^ ^
I ' m ha p p y to know about this sit e .
I ' ll try to write a di ar y and c or re c t some on e ' s di ar y every day .
I am t est ing whether or not L an g - 8 has re ally become f aster after it s ma in ten ance and I think it is work ing just fine .
A c ce s s sp e ed is very c ri t ical for an S N S and I re ally a p p re c i ate the effort which the s ta f f has made so far .
No w I can keep up on my language p r a c t ic es .
I thought that c re at ing pro x ies was difficult .
But to day , I w ro te one .
It was piece of c a ke .
but us ing that co d e , I can access that U R L .
That me ch an is m is , When I access `` U R L `` , pro x y respon se `` U R L `` .
normal ly , A j a x can not cross sit e .
but , but us ing this me ch an is m , per ha p s , I can do it .
He ll o , I ' m new here .
But then I re al i z ed it was an interest ing one ; there f or e , I have re g is ter ed here .
P e op le say I ' m ma k ing big pro g re s s , but I do n ' t think so ,
because my spoke n English is still poor .
I of ten talk to n at ive speak er s , but act u ally , I do n ' t understand them too much .
Yes ter day , the ra in y sea s on began at K y us y u dis t ri c t , which is l o c at ed in the so u th w est er n part of J a p an .
It will begin in all part s of the country d ur ing the next f e w days .
I do n ' t like this sea s on because it is difficult to go out on a ra in y day .
But you can see beautiful h y d r an g e a d ur ing the ra in y sea s on in J a p an .
My ha ir is part ed on the left side .
When I put down my ha ir , it is long enough to re a ch my middle back .
I am p l an n ing to gr ow it long er ; to my l ow er back .
I us ed to we ar bang s . ( O r have bang s )
S in ce I was told to re ve al my for e head to have better l u c k , I gr e w the front ha ir out and p ul led it to the side .
The sh op always has f l ow er ( s ) in a big va se .
To day ' s f l ow er is called `` f o x face `` .
My friend is a teacher at a j un i or co ll e g e .
She said , `` What do you think ? ``
I thought about it a little b it , and I answered ,
She smile d in agreement , and s i p p ed hot co f f e e .
I ' m not going to school
because of the school open ing ce re m on y
I am going to go to the l i b r ar y and study hard
and go to a c ad e m y ( a c ad e m y ? )
To day is a ho l i day .
I was very sick last / on T h ur s day .
But I did not go to the ho s p it al , because I was bu s y .
I felt re ally bad .
I feel so good .
Yes ter day was my friend ' s b ir th day .
I b ough t her a clock and a ha ir d ry er .
I dr o ve to the part y .
We are at the part y .
I could n ' t go to A k it a to enjoy it / the f est i v al but I watch ed it on T V .
I have never see n the f i re w or k s neither on T V no r re al one / live .
B e c a us e they are so beautiful with beautiful m us ic .
In the train , a high school st ud ent sat down on a cha ir .
In front of him an el d er ly woman appeared .
He said to her ' S it down , please . '
But she de c line d that propos al so he felt e m b ar as s ed and p ity for as k ing .
A week la ter , a head of an el d er ly man , the st ud ent sat down without saying anything .
What would you do ( can do n ' t need ) if you were the st ud ent ?
But you should know there are people who do n ' t want to be asked .
W ome n L o ve T al k ing .
My friend and I were going to do home w or k after class e .
We were do ing the home w or k at the good p a ce .
But then we started talk ing about our high school days to re fresh our s el ve s because we were tired .
We had no time to do the home w or k , so we each went home .
It is very f un for me to talk with my friend s .
P ro b ably , most w ome n like it .
I ' m a J a p an e se .
I like my c at .
He r name is Ka r up in .
She w a ke s up me at se ve n every day .
But we sleep to g e ther .
It ' s very c ut e and I feel re la x ed .
To day , I work ed as in ter n at a small ve n ture comp an y .
In this comp an y , there are only four people and some in ter n students includ ing me .
This comp an y de al s with some I T - like business .
And to day after work ing I had dinner with my a c qu a in t ance , a person who is work ing in the f a m ous con s ul ting comp an y a c c en ture .
He was also b or n in Ka n s a i are a , I mean O s a k a , so the te m po we spoke at ma t ch ed .
The to p ic of my ex pe ri ence s on my tri p to the P h il i p p in es that I had this A u g ust came up in con ver s ation .
I had tra ve led alone to thoroughly o b s er ve the different c ul ture and study English , and my tri al re s ul ted in success .
I had a p re c i ous ex pe ri ence .
And as I talk ed about it , I do n ' t know why , but I not ic ed tea r s in my eyes .
This is probab ly because of the ex pe ri ence I had there , that is what I saw in the s l um s and people in po ver ty and what I felt was un re as on able .
I re m e m b er think ing that I want to heart i ly change d this sit u ation , to help people who natural ly did n ' t do anything wrong .
I thought again about what I should do .
I asked to myself again in my mind , but I still have no answer .
F ro m the a ng le where I was sea ted , I could see Y o s s y and behind her , through the w in d ow , the g l o o m y , st or m y we a ther in Tokyo ; I could n ' t he ar any sound s of the ra in or thunder .
If you had stood next to the s l id ing do or of the room he ar ing what was being talk ed inside , you might have heard in ter m it t ent laugh ing sound s made by a f e m al e ( 1 only ? ) , and mo no t on ous , ent h us i a st ic talk s by a ma le ( 1 only ? ) , which might have ga ve you an impress ion ; the at m o s p he re was not too bad , or too good either .
It has been about 2 week s since I have j o in ed this sit e .
S ur e ly , I have got ten many friend s that re ally want to help me .
However , I only found one friend on this sit e who was re ally kind and conc er n ed .
She is L a ur a , also called A m a y a , .
She is from the U S .
She always help s me on every j o ur n al that I have written .
She also c or re c t s me .
I ' m pro ud of her because even though she is bu s y work ing and study ing .
She still find s time to help me .
So , I would like to than k A m a y a for her help and a d v ic e .
I ho pe she will a ch i e ve her dr e a m of study ing in J a p an .
On b ir th day s , f a m il ies ga ther and wish each other well .
I feel please d . I feel ha p p y .
I ho pe we will con t in u e to be a pe a ce ful family in the future .
I have p r a c t ical train ing for three days , and the comp an y ' s do r m has w i re less in ter ne t .
I c a n ' t s ur f the in ter ne t on the first day so I am very s ad because I s ur f the in ter ne t almost every day .
But to day , I can s ur f the in ter ne t . I am very glad so I like the comp an y more than before !
R e c ent ly , a high - sp e ed train a c c id ent o c c ur r ed in C h in a .
I ' ve me t some c al m and gentle people from C h in a to talk to with this sit e .
O f course , not every on e is like this .
I still want to see the world and co m m un ic ate with many people .
H i , I ' m C ar on te 7 5 1 and this is my first po st on this sit e ,
I ' d like to im p ro ve my English by writing some st or ies or paragraph s
I ho pe to do the same for you .
A t that time I did n ' t know how to eat it , so I po ur ed mi l k over it , which did n ' t ta s te very good .
In Tokyo I found m u es l i in a gr o ce ry st or e .
I saw how to make it so f t by so a k ing it for s ever al hour s in y o g ur t .
It seemed like a good idea .
I b ough t a pack age of m u es l i , mi x ed it with y o g ur t and put it in my re f ri g er at or at night before going to be d .
The next morning , I had it with j a m .
It was so de l ic i ous that I want to have it more of ten .
I will have f un . It will be f un .
I T h in k of My s el f on Q u ic k S and

A fter in t ro d u c ing the perform ance s y s te m to mi m ic the U S , tea m w or k does not work and we think of co - work er s as e ne m ies .

We , however , ex p l o it te m p or ar y s ta f f and live in a do g - eat - do g world .
We bu l ly we a k er e m p l o y e es and they bu l ly the we a ke st .
L u c k i ly I have a job and a depend able in c ome .
But , I feel help less
some time s when my co ll e a gue s leave the office .
I ' ve just re m e m b er ed I knew `` x x x `` has `` that `` mean ing when every on e told me , and I do n ' t want to mi s le ad you guy s with my name any more !
My c ut e `` My L it t le P on y `` should not con ne c ted to such a n as ty w or d .
l o l o l o l No , they should not . . . . . . . . .
We just know `` K is s K is s K is s `` , that is why you can see c ut e and class y J a p an e se girl s have us er n ame s includ e `` x x x `` on t w it ter !
B el i e ve it or not , we just think `` x x x `` look s `` Ka w a i i `` .
I ch o se `` C h l o e `` for my new name because my re al name start s `` C `` also .
: - ) I think `` C in d y `` is a g o o d one , too .
My de e pe st con d o l ence s to the e ar th qu a ke v ic t im s .
I ' m pretty s ad about the e ar th qu a ke that happen ed in J a p an a f e w days a g o .
G o o d l u c k to all the people that live in J a p an !
My comp an y ' s office hour s are suppose d to be from 1 0 : 0 0 to 7 : 0 0 p m .
But , no body leave s the office at 7 : 0 0 .
My co w or k er s all work unti l l ate at night .
I do n ' t know ex a c t ly what time they go home because I ' m one of the first three people to leave the office .
I usual ly leave the office around 7 : 3 0 .
I want to finish my job at ex a c t ly 7 : 0 0 and enjoy my p ri v ate life .
But It ' s a w k w ar d to leave office at 7 while other s are work ing s il ent ly . . .
I ' m not that con f id ent about get ting a high s c or e , but I ' ll try my be st .
One of my friend s on s k y pe told me that all you have to do is conc ent r ate on the ex a m and re la x .
C er tain ly , it is ne ce s s ar y to re la x to get a high s c or e .
S in ce I ' ve written some j o ur n al s about T O E I C , you might have gue s s ed that I ri s k my life for it , but that ' s not tru e .
Well , study ing business English is b l o o d y b or ing .
I do n ' t think that much business English is need ed to co m m un ic ate with for e i g n people .
what should I write to my p en p al s about ?
if everything would be so easy then I could just start writing right now . . .
it ' s a big `` di le m m a `` .
can you re c o m m en d something to me ?
T w o week s a g o I b ough t a new p or t able D V D play er that is re g ion free at an on line sh op .
A l th ough I like it , I have found that some D V D s do not work .
I have l ot s of A m er ic an D V D s who se re g ion co d e is 1 in my house .
When I tri ed to find out why I can not watch some of them , I dis c o ver ed there are the re g ion co d e of some D V D s that could not be re c o g n i z e with a re g ion free D V D play er .
That is why some my D V D s do n ' t work with my D V D play er .
So , I am think ing when I go to A m er ic a next time , I will bu y a p or t able re g ion 1 D V D play er .
I think if I b ough t it , since all my D V D s are re g ion co d e 1 , I could watch all of them .
A l th ough I have to ha ng on unti l I go to A m er ic a again , I think it is a good idea .
I ho pe I will be able to bu y a good one at a good p ri ce .
I str a in ed my back when I tri ed to l if t a s ta c k of 2 4 D V D s .
It ' s too he a v y for me ?
He re ' s my last question ^ ^ l o l
When I speak English , al th ough it is n ' t in a per f e c t sen t ence , a n at ive speak er can usual ly understand what I mean .
But , I always wonder if my English is right .
S e e , I have never visit ed a for e i g n country .
As an English - language le ar n er , it is de f in ite ly ne ce s s ar y to go to a b ro ad but I do n ' t have enough money .
I heard that S ook m y un g U n ive r s ity ' s T E S O L course is l in k ed to a for e i g n un ive r s ity , so after I finish the course I ho pe to study a b ro ad at a for e i g n un ive r s ity .
As an English - language le ar n er , I feel that the English education in K or e a has not been effect ive .
T h r ough the T E S O L course , I ho pe to im p ro ve myself as a qu al if i ed English teacher .
A fter finish the course , I will p r a c t ic e what I have le ar n ed in p re p ar ation to tea ch K in d er g ar ten and if the ch ance come s to me I ho pe to go to gradua te school .
However , the in ter f a ce is not as so p h is t ic at ed as that of i P h on e .
M or e o ver , the display sp e ed was very s l ow . So I felt s light ly im p at i ent .
A m a z on should de s i g n K in d le to show the pro g re s s st at us clear ly , as it take s s ever al second s to finish some op er ation .
I have been g l ut t on ous re c ent ly . . . .
I had dinner the day before but I at e two more ha m b ur g er s l ate at night after dinner
I was hung ry soon after eat ing . . .
Why is this so ? ? ?
( G o o d ) M or n ing !
I found M r . ho u 8 5 9 2 9 8 4 ' s b l o g .
H is C h in e se f a ir y t al es are so f ant a st ic !
What do you think about ly ing ?
Some people say that it ' s not good to tell a lie even if you have a reason to do it , while other s say that some time s we need to lie to make people feel better .
What do you think about it ?
In or d er to con t in ut e to write English , I should de c id e a them e .
The m e : D e p re s s ion
R e as on s : No w my hu s b and is work ing ( for school s ) as a J a p an e se teacher .
B y writing his de p re s s ion j o ur n al , I would like de p re s s ive p at i ent s and their f a m il ies to know about this dis e a se / i ll ness and sure ly believe in his or her re c o ver y .
( This is po s s i b ly d u e to my little read ing ex pe ri ence , my being la z y and i g n or ant . ) I certain ly enjoy ed read ing it in the original a co up le of year s a g o , and for that now I probab ly do n ' t need the di ction ar y any m or e .
No w I ' m stay ing in / at my a un t ' s house .
E ver y time I go on a tri p , I visit here .
There are five people here ; My un c le and a un t , gr and m o ther , a ma le c ous in , and a c ous in , who is a s ing le mother and has a b a b y .
I did not dr in k al c o h o l in a co up le of days .
I have been a very good girl .
I did n ' t dr in k yesterday too .
I have to tea ch a dance class every th ur s day . ( yesterday was th ur s day )
I was r us h ing to go to the dance st ud i o .
I was l ate le aving my place .
I ra n to the train st ation and when I was on the train I found out
that I was we ar ing two different sh o es on my feet . . .
T h o se sh o es had different co l or s and sha pe s .
I re ally want ed to go back to change them , but I did ' t have time to .
so I stay ed on the train we ar ing two different sh o es .
I was stand ing on one f o ot on the train .
when I got to the st ud i o , every body laugh ed at me so hard .
I was d y ing of laugh ter .
This past co up le of week s , I ' ve been very bu s y .
I had a l ot of things to do , so may b e I was tired ? !
I know It ' s not a good ex c us e .
I play ed f ut s al for the first time in three week s and s c or ed four go al s and ( did ) made four as s is t s .
B t w , I ' m going to bu y a present for a g if t ex change part y on C h ri st m as but I do n ' t know what to bu y because the present is n ' t for some on e sp e c i al .
I could n ' t us e a comp ut er for a long time .
So , I could n ' t return any me s s age s .
I am sorry for the de la y in my respon se s .
A l s o , I ' m just feel ing a little de p re s s ed about J a p an .
The sit e is re ally good because there are many people who le ar n a second or th ir d language there and all of us can help each other c or re c t our writing .
U n t il re c ent ly , I had give n up writing con t in u ous ly s ever al time s . However the sit e is like a so c i al co m m un ity and I can visit it as much as I want .
So I can keep writing more f re qu ent ly .
As my friend in the sit e said , I need to read more English writing .
The ar t ic le was about a girl who had a N e w Z e al and father and a J a p an e se mother .
She ha ted her look s unti l she became a te en age r .
But la ter she found out about her be a ut y and became a fashion mo d el .
I was impress ed by her story .
I am think ing ma g a z in es are good for read ing , but I can not a f f or d to bu y new ma g a z in es and I do not want to read old ma g a z in es from second h and sh op s .
However I might have to bu y new ma g a z in es some time s .
R e c ent ly , I got a B l ow O f f V al ve for my c ar .
She live s in Tokyo so she can & n b s p ; go to & n b s p ; the un i she se le c ted , so we have n ' t see n each other for a while .
We talk ed about a l ot of things and c r a c k ed up : - >
I like c ook ing more than anything else , but I ' m wonder ing serious ly if I should go into the way of c ook ing . . .
In addition , I re ally like c ook ing , but I ' m not very good at c ook ing .
And if you live in F r ance , please give me some i nformation about F r ance . ( In English , please . )
If we had a large ga r d en , we could have a b ar b e c u e there .
If you are a b s ent in class , you would get y el led at by the teacher .
If you left a me s s age on my p h on e , I would have called you back .
A : Why did you ri d e a b i ke to her house yesterday ?
It is too far from your house , is n ' t it ?
B : If I had had a c ar , I would have go ne there by the c ar .
I so l d my g u it ar to day because I ' m going back to J a p an soon and I c a n ' t a f f or d to take it to J a p an .
I b ough t my g u it ar 1 0 month s a g o and have play ed every day before going to be d .
I told my s is ter to con st ant ly play my g u it ar s in J a p an because my in st r u ment s feel l on e ly .
It is a fact that your in st r u ment s will go bad if you do n ' t play them for a long time .
I c a n ' t believe that the N ation al C ent r al L i b r ar y change d the time for my in ter n s h i p and did n ' t tell me !
So un f or t un ate ly , I will have to c ance l my part - time job d ur ing my s um m er va c ation , and this will also make me los e at least 8 0 0 0 N T do ll ar s .
but I do n ' t know how to do it .
how does every on e get so many friend s ?
if I sen d a me s s age to a strange r like `` He ll o , let ' s be friend s ! ``
I re ally think we will be good language part n er s : ) `` ?
I have n ' t a p p ro a ch ed to people much .
I s this re ally J a p an e se think ing ?
L ook ing at la ng - 8 , there are va ri ous people .
But I not ic e J a p an e se is difficult .
I am J a p an e se but J a p an e se language has many con f us ing things .
I for g ot my um b re ll a ! !
To day is a bad day ! !
S t op ra in ing . . . .
They ta st ed very good !
I l o ve the ta s te of p or k .
No w , I have c re at ed a do c u ment on a P C ! !
B o ther s ome ! ! !
I will try hard finish soon !
When had you tra ve led some where re c ent ly ?
I had been to T ur ke y last s um m er .
I went to C a p p ad o c i a .
C a p p ad o c i a is very interest ing because there are many character is t ic r ock s .
One of them is like a came l ( P ic ture 1 ) .
I s c al ed some r ock s and the scene ry which I saw from the up p er part of r ock s is so beautiful and am a z ing .
I was impress ed with the be a ut y of nature .
I found a di f f er ence in s um m er between G er man y and J a p an .
In J a p an , we he ar the bu z z ing of c ic ad as all the time and every where .
I l o ve s um m er better than w in ter because I like s w im m ing , water m el on , and f i re w or k s e t c .
I have to try to s a ve e le c t ri c ity this year , so I ' m going to bu y a J a p an e se f an .
Why I ' m study ing English is to co m m un ic ate with people from other co un t ri es and to study j e w el er y de s i g n in A m s ter d a m ( the N e ther l and s ) .
I b a k ed a c a ke us ing less eggs and but ter last week .
I re ally , re ally like them .
But almost all sweet s are high in c al or ies .
So I thought of how to b a ke a c a ke without us ing much o il , eggs and other high c al or i e stuff .
O f course it should be y um m y !
It had a light ta s te and it was y um m y .
My mother told me she l o v ed it , too .
This re c i pe has become my re g ul ar me n u !
It was sp ic y , but ta s ty .
The p ri ce was more ex p en s ive than other re st a ur ant s , but s er v ic e was better .
There was a live b and which play ed n ic e m us ic .
I ' d like to go to again .
2 n d an n ive r s ar y of going out with my girl f ri en d .
To day is the / my 2 n d / second an n ive r s ar y of going out with my girl f ri en d .
F ir st , we went to A m er ic an V i ll age in O s a k a .
She b ough t me some p ant s / a bo t t o m and two shirt s .
They ' re so co o l !
N e x t , we went to Ka i y u k an ( an a qu ar i um in O s a k a ) .
We looked at l ot s of / many fish and took l ot s of / many p h ot o s .
I ' m going to bu y a present for her ( since / because we did n ' t have time to day ) .
I just heard about this sit e a f e w days a g o .
I do n ' t know who made this we b s ite , but I w an n a than k him / her .
It ' s a very interest ing place to part ic i p ate in ! : )
I l o ve ri d ing b ic y c le s !
We can enjoy M i ku s ing ing so ng s as like .
They made her s ing in front of hu n d r ed s of people ! !
M i ku had her first conc er t s in Tokyo and A m er ic a .
I was de e p ly impress ed when I saw her conc er t D V D .
I s an g to g e ther with her and an a ud i ence on D V D ( ^ ^ ;
No w J a p an ' s e c on o m y is de c l in ing .
The a ut o m o b i le has been a ma in e ng in e for J a p an e se e c on o m y for a long time .
In the 1 96 0 ' s and 7 0 ' s any you ng people long ed for a c ar .
I ' m sure M i ku ' s conc er t is first thing ! ( ^ ^ ) I ' m very very glad to see a game character coming to see me out of P C .
I went to Y u as a town yesterday for a business tri p .
That town is well know as an old so y s a u ce town .
So y s a u ce was made about 8 0 0 year s a g o in that town so there are a l ot of old so y s a u ce and so y be an fact or ies there .
We also visit ed a so y s a u ce m us e um .
He y / H i , I did n ' t write anything on la ng - 8 for a long , long time .
G u es s it was because the f i re inside me b ur n t to cha r c o al and I ' ve los t my spirit : (
So , in the past two year s I ' ve change d a l ot , and now I ' m certain ly more to l er ant , f o c us ing on study ing / my st ud ies , but not for g e t ting about friend s . : D
And , I ' m a k or e an living in k or e a . *
I re ally re ally want to study e ng l ish with friend s from other co un t ri es * *
L if e is full of te m p t ation s , es pe c i ally when some on e is study ing a b ro ad .
My friend and I went to eat supper to g e ther to ce le b r ate his future .
A fter we went on the In ter ne t to play game s .
N e x t , we play ed c ar d s for such a long time that we became hung ry .
I and two me n went to bu y some f o o d at 3 o ' clock at night .
U n f or t un ate ly no ne of them were open so we watch ed a ho r r or f il m called ' The gr ud g e ' and then we s l ept .
under too much p re s s ur e
O ut of all the to p ic s in my class , the hot t est to p ic , the p re s s ur e we are under is dis c us s ed f re qu ent ly .
It is said that students in for e i g n co un t ri es usual ly get up at 9 : 0 0 and then go to school , and it is at 3 : 0 0 when the school is over , right ? ? ? But the sit u ation in our country is the op po s ite .
No t only the time t able is am a z ing , but we le ar n a l ot .
E ver y ter m we study C h in e se , M a th , English , P h y s ic s , C he m is t ry , B i o l o g y , H is t or y , P o l it ic s , G e o g r a p h y , M us ic , A r t , and P h y s ical education , 1 3 in all .
That is s c ar y , do n ' t you think so ? ?
On the other hand , the c ur ri c ul um that we study is difficult too .
No w I will give a ex amp le for in st ance , which was the most difficult less on in one of our ma th t est s ( I us e picture to show it ) :
One week has pass ed in C an ad a
But I feel a little di f f er ence between J a p an and C an ad a because there are many J a p an e se students who be l on g to the same co ll e g e where I ' m stay ing .
It ' s mean ing less study ing a b ro ad , though I want to p r a c t ic e con ver s ation s in English .
I am not good at listen ing to English con ver s ation s .
C an any on e tell me the way to im p ro ve my con ver s ation al s k i ll s ?
I am a st ud ent , study English for becom ing f l u ent ly English speak er .
My st ud ent v is a was sen t to my house from the A m er ic an e m b as s y this morning .
I ' m feel ing easy now that I have my v is a , though I knew there would be no pro ble m . . .
It was first time I went to the A m er ic an e m b as s y .
When I got there , I was so surprise d that there was a l ot of people wait ing outside the e m b as s y .
M or e than 1 5 0 people were there .
B e c a us e only 6 people at a time can get into the little house next to the ga te , we had to wait a long time .
I stood for an hour .
L u c k y , that day was not ra in ing or s un n y . .
It is mi d s um m er now , but it was co o l that day .
U p on ent er ing the house , a man c he c k ed me , and my b a g with an X - ra y machi ne .
I was surprise d I had to leave my ce ll ul ar p h on e behind .
I then I could f in ally get inside the e m b as s y .
It took more than half an hour to finish inside .
I need ed to have an in ter v i e w , and then have my f ing er p r in t s take n .
The style of all the f ur n ish ing s in the bu il d ing were A m er ic an .
I felt like I was already in the U S
It was funny !
H a ve you ever been to a J a p an e se E m b as s y in your country ?
If you have , how was it ?
I gue s s you probab ly did n ' t have to wait as long as me . . .
She usual ly say s : `` I ' m so tired ! ! ``
No w my mother is read ing English because she want s
I ' m only a middle school st ud ent .
I ' ll sen d them to you soon ! ! ^ ^
The head of the de p ar t ment that I ' m in told us that most of the so p h o m or es includ ing those who transfer r ed to this co ll e g e might ' ve got ten over 6 5 0 point s in T O E I C .
I had thought I was s m ar ter than students who had st ud i ed at the co ll e g e just because I transfer r ed .
I found that I was wrong .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t like to comp ar e myself with other s .
One of the reason s is be c as u e when you comp ar e your s el f with other s and there is some on e s m ar ter than you , you get very de p re s s ed , like you ' re going to di e .
A no ther reason is that I do n ' t like people who look down on other s , and when there is some on e less s m ar t than me , I find myself look ing down on him .
As I w ro te yesterday , I had to write a r ough dr a f t of short paper on be h al f of my el d er d aught er .
To day , I had to tra n s l ate her me s s age for her gradua tion ce re m on y .
She will be gradua ting from e le ment ar y school soon !
She has be e en only three month s in this e le ment ar y school , but she need ed to write some ar t ic le s ;
But I feel so much an x i e ty now .
You know , my English is so poor and I do n ' t have any con f id ence in my writing at all .
If I had more time to sub m it , I would write the sen t ence s here and as k you to c or re c t !
A T y p h o on I s A p p ro a ch ing !
A ty p h o on is s l ow ly coming on it s way to J a p an .
I ' m p l an n ing to tra ve l to G un m a P re f e c ture on S ept e m b er 2 n d and 3 r d ,
So I ' m a b it w or ri ed .
I ' ll go to a hot sp a hotel and eat many kind s of de l ic i ous f o o d such as c r a b , s te a k , de s s er t s and so on .
I st ud i ed English very much d ur ing this s um m er va c ation , so I want to take a re st and enjoy this tri p ! ? ?
I want to visit as many place s as possible !
What should I do ?
F ir st , I should re m e m b er l ot s of English w or d s .
N e x t , I should re m e m b er l ot s of E g l ish sen t ence s .
she is one of my favor ite J a p an e se s ing er s .
I re ally like her so ng s es pe c i ally this so ng I put a l in k to .
She has stop p ed her s ing ing b e c a us e of her i ll ness and will now take a long b re a k .
I re ally want her to come back and re le a se new so ng s some day .
He r so ng s give me en er g y es pe c i ally when I feel kind of down .
I think every on e has th e ir ow n favor ite so ng that make s them better .
I like both J a p an e se so ng s called J - p op and for e i g n m us ic .
But J a p an e se m us ic is more co m f or t able for me , may b e because it ' s easy to understand the mean ing of ly ri c s .
S pe a k ing of ly ri c s in English so ng s , it ' s very hard to l is i ten and understand comp ar ed to in a c on ver s ation . . .
D o es any on e feel the same way when you he ar so ng s written in the language you ' re le ar n ing ?
In the future ho pe ful ly my English will be better and I will be able to understand ly ri c s .
I have been study ing English for e i g h te en year s , start ing from gra d e school , con t in u ing at the in st it ut e , to now - by myself .
But I have not had much success with my st ud ies .
F or ex amp le , I can understand only a very small part of ra d i o and t v b ro ad c a st s , or di al o g s in mo v i e picture s .
C o ul d some on e give me a hand ? T w o sen t ence s , A : `` D o you like the gr e en one ? `` and B : `` What about the b l u e one ? `` .
C an I re ver se ( or s w a p ) A and B ' s position in the follow ing ar t ic le ?
What ' s the di f f er ence between `` do you like `` and `` what about `` ?
It ' s beautiful , but too small for me .
It ' s a n ic e dress , I ' ll take it .
It ' s been a while since I w ro te my last ent ry here .
How ' s life going every on e ?
My S um m er ho l i day f in ally started on the 5 th .
I ' m enjoy ing it : ]
I ' m going off to Ya man ash i P re f e c ture with my family this We d ne s day for a short tri p .
I ' m not that ex cited about it honest ly . . . .
But I have got a l ot of p l an s this S um m er : D ho pe it ' s going to be a great S um m er V a c ation !
And , my b a b y bo y is coming back to J a p an on the 1 8 th . . . < 3 < 3 < 3
I can n no t wait X D I have n ' t see n him for almost 3 month s .
I do n ' t know why but I ' m hung ry right now .
It ' s 1 : 5 4 a m in J a p an . . .
I think it ' s just because I at e dinner e ar l i er to n i g h .
I should n t have take n a long n a p . . . . .
A fter a one year ch il d c ar e leave , I f in ally return ed to my work at the end of S ept e m b er .
However , now I am work ing from 9 am to 4 p m to account for the need s of my one year old d aught er .
S in ce I started to work again , I can not write L an g - 8 j o ur n al s so of ten .
S t i ll , I want to con t in u e .
I ' m keep ing this j o ur n al in case my d aught er become s interest ed in for e i g n language s in the future .
A M o ther ' s j o ur n al written in some for e i g n language s is interest ing enough to mo t i v ate her d aught er to le ar n to read them .
D o n ' t you think so ?
My bo y f ri en d and I have in l o ve with each other since M ar ch last year .
We went to a very p op ul ar re st a ur ant in L ot te hotel to ce le b r ate .
The p ri ce of dinner was 6 2 0 0 0 w on per person ,
but we had dinner free of charge
because I had two g if t ti c ke t s for the L ot te H ot el .
The f o o d was very de l ic i ous .
I ' m very full now .
L ot te H ot el l o b b y is so beautiful .
He ga ve me some c l o th es as a present .
So n y is a f a m ous c or p or ation .
One of the most f a m ous So n y de v ic es is the P la y S t ation .
it is a very us e ful de v ic e .
It is J u ly 2 n d to day - - that mean s half the year has pass ed .
This half year was quite a bu s y one for me .
A fter mo v ing into C A and get ting us ed to the life , I found I was p re g n ant .
What will the l at ter half of 2 0 1 0 be like ?
I ho pe it would be a good one and I ' d like to me e t my b a b y b or n he al th i ly .
I ho pe I can do my be st in study and work .
On N e w Y e ar ' s D a y , we had a N e w Y e ar ' s dis h called `` O se ch i `` .
But now , most J a p an e se bu y it at the s up er m a ke t and de p ar t ment st or e .
B e c a us e there once live d so many people in a family , the mother and gr and m a ther made many dis he s for their ch il d re n and gue st s ; however , there are many n u c le ar f a m il ies in J a p an and are f e w gue st s .
`` O se ch i `` - ma k ing is re ally hard work .
I will mi s s the c ust o m s which we start ing to los e .
And this is my first p ic n ic in my co ll e g e !
I think it must be very interest ing !
The ha p p i ness on their face s mean s I did well .
I think it has been my dr e a m since I was a bo y !
No w it is coming tru e .
I wish all my friend s ha p p i ness !
I ' m from K or e a .
I am in A m er ic a to study English .
And this D e ce m b er , I will go back to K or e a .
I want to make friend s to study English through cha t ting or m s n p h on e .
So a d d me on m s n .
I ' m study ing English now .
I am a begin n er at English , so I am bad at w ri t ting my thought s .
I want to make a l ot of friend s here .
T h an k you for read ing this .
I had a bad co l d . I am not very fine . I ho pe that every on e take good care of them s el f and do n ' t get co l d like me .
The we a ther is bad . It is was t to have a co l d .
I thought I should ta ke some m ed ic en e .
I think that many of the J a p an e se me m b er s of la ng 8 will write about the same to p ic tomorrow .
B e c a us e tomorrow is T an a b at a , a tra d i tion al J a p an e se ho l i day .
L on g , long a g o , there were a co up le of l o ver s .
However , the l o ver s could n ' t see each other .
They could only see each other once a year .
D u e to the story , it is believe d that our wish es will come tru e if we p r a y one wish on that day .
I ' m old er so I can not re m e m b er some f a ir y ta il s very well .
It was very hard to write this ent ry .
M or n ing g l or ies just do n ' t b l o o m because of the s un ri se .
They are ( g en etic ally ) pro g r a m m ed to b l o o m about e i g h t hour s after s un se t .
A fter I entered K y ot o U n ive r s ity , I tri ed to play the g u it ar for some time , but I always ga ve up im m ed i ate ly .
I am dis a p po in ted that I am not p at i ent .
What is the ke y to not g i v ing up play ing the g u it ar ?
I have a l ot of free time to day .
I saw this sit e from a T V pro g r a m .
I know a little English and I want to le ar n more .
R i g h t now I ' m study ing English in
and I ho pe that you can help me by im p ro v ing my English . I ' d like to make some new friend s here .
F e el ing down
I went sh op p ing with my hu s b and a f e w days a g o .
A fter we sh op p ed , we went to b a ke ry to bu y b re a k f a st for the next day .
I pai d money for b re ad and receiv ed the change but I for g ot to take the b re ad . . .
I went to another bra n ch of the same b a ke ry to day .
I looked at the p ri ce that I had for g ot ten the b re ad .
P o l ic e do g
I found be l ow an ar t ic le .

( A 3 ) is more easy and simple than ( A 2 ) , so some time s we us e ( A 3 ) in s te ad of ( A 2 ) .
D o es that make sen se ?
It is the G o l d en We e k ho l i day per i o d in J a p an now .
We have ho l i day s for up to 1 6 days .
The job train ing has finish ed , so I have to go back to my ro ut in e job , teaching ma th .
Yes ter day , my bo s s called me and ga ve me some work to do for the next day .
My bo s s said , he had some business to do from yesterday , so he need ed me to do something .
There were just only two students in the class ro o m .
I help ed them de al with their home w or k .
The job was easy for me .
The two students are very s m ar t t w in s .
N e w - ty pe T r ous er s
It ' s been very hot around here the se days .
It ' s hard to sleep even for a s ing le hour without us ing an a ir condition er .
L a st night , I s w e at a l ot , so I put all the c l o th es around me into the was h ing machi ne .
I w o ke up feel ing re fresh ed this morning and found no t r ous er s in my room .
G re at !
E ver y th ing seemed per f e c t .
I got t r ous er s as co l d as water .
I thought that I would be able to conc ent r ate on work for to day .
P le a se do n ' t say where I am po st ing this ent ry .
O b v i ous ly , the effect of the new - ty pe t r ous er s last ed only two hour s .
T h an k you M i y a k o ^ ^
I can understand a little b it of English . . .
So I ' m p r a c t is ing by writing the di ar y in English !
B e c a us e I want to get better at English ^ ^
He l p me with a bu n ch of potatoes !
I ' m d y ing from think ing about f o o d s every minute .
I ' ve read two th ir d s of the first b ook of The M a in S t re e t S er ies .
I think it ' s a little b it b or ing .
But I have an impress ion that if I read a little more , it ' ll turn out to be interest ing . . .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to going to S an F r an c is c o again .
My w if e and I called him `` The G re at A d v ent ur er , `` and prais ed his co ur age very much .
I think a l ot of an x i e ty affect ed him very much and he did not know how to co pe with it .
When he stay ed up l ate last night , I told him to go to be d ,
I think there was no particular reason .
A n y way , it was a very n ic e day for us .
I am look ing for w ar d to see ing how he will gr ow up from now on .
I must have got ( ten ) some kind of v ir us when I went to a town to do my C h ri st m as sh op p ing . S e e be l ow .
I ' ll see how go es .
`` O t l o b `` is a de l ive ry - s er v ic e sit e address in E g y p t .
So I or d er ed M us h ro o m & C he e se F e t ir a ( E g y p t P i z z a ) us ing the sit e now that I know about it .
But I should go down to the 1 st floor because the e le v at or does n ' t work to day . This way , the de l ive ry man w o n ' t need to call me .
My house ( room ) is on the 1 0 th floor . ( T .
T ) This is not a de l ive ry s er v ic e .
It was w ar m yesterday .
I s l i p p ed in the s n ow before .
I have pai n in my l ow er back .
I just finish ed my home w or k .
That ' s my home w or k sub j e c t .
I need to us e this sen t ence to write a 5 0 0 w or d the s is .
However when I have done my home w or k and read it care ful ly ,
I found that there were still many things that need s to be f i x ed .
I see m to be stand ing far , far away from my English le ar n ing go al .
I c a n ' t speak English . T T
L a st year , I went to P us an in So u th K or e a and st ud i ed there for a half year .
I can speak K or e an .
However , the more I study K or e an , the more I for g e t English .
My ho b b y is play ing b a se b a ll and tra ve ling the world .
I go watch a b a se b a ll game when I am free .
and I like to go on a tri p to the f a m ous place s in J a p an and a b ro ad . And I visit ed C h in a last week .
I ' ve visit ed more than five co un t ri es but C h in a has been the most interest ing country .
I want to visit not only As i a but also E ur o pe in the future .
He al th c he c k for B re a st C ance r
To day I got a half day off to have a re g ul ar c he c k up for can c er .
I ' ve kept having it once in every year .
To day I was so tired ; too long to wait for my turn .
But this c he c k up is very im p or t ant .
I think he al th is the most im p or t ant thing for life .
D o you have a re g ul ar me d ical c he c k up ?
A fter s ever al days of re st ing , I ' ve re c o ver ed from the f ever .
To ce le b r ate I called my friend s and we de c id ed to go to da n c ing at a c l u b that has C ar i b b e an style s of da n c ing ( s al s a , me re n gue , b a ch at a ) .
As soon as we entered , my every thought was address ed to the m us ic . So after I re m o v ed my co at quick ly , my body began con ne c ting with the tra c k play ing .
B e t w e en all the C ar i b b e an dance s , the one which I prefer is s al s a . That is because it express es pass ion , a character is t ic that is part of me . In fact I ' m a s c or p ion ^ ^ .
When I listen to this m us ic , in particular M ar c A n th on y , I become one with the me l o d y and I feel free . E ver y th ing around me dis a p pe ar s and I feel only my heart b e at that follow s the r h y th m of the m us ic .
D ance to me is like the a ir that I b re a th . When I was sick it re n d er ed me im po s s i ble to enjoy da n c ing , but now I am much better ! ^ _ _ ^
A fter we f in ally es c a p ed from the c l u b , we stop p ed in a beautiful b ar where we had a b re a k f a st of c or ne t t o and c a p p u c c in o . So it turn s out we saw the s un ri se , the b ir th of a new day . D a w n is a ma g n if ic ent show !
Y U I is from F U K U O K A and she is 2 2 year s old .
When she was 1 6 year s old ( O R : When she was 1 6 ) , she at ten d ed M us ic co a ch ing school .
But then she became i ll .
As she did n ' t have enough money , she began to work in a C h in e se re st a ur ant .
He r every day life became very bu s y ( a ud i tion s , ho s p it al and work ) .
F in ally , she pass ed one of her a ud i tion s .
She was ch o s en among 2 0 0 0 0 part ic i p ant s .
A L it t le He s it ation and N er v ous ness
I am very bu s y the se days .
My gr o up ' s le ad er asked me to p re p ar e a ra ce speech and a show of a c c o m p l ish ment s because we have a va c ant position for se c re ta ry of the you th le a gue co m m it te e in the gr o up .
I just have a little he s it ation and n er v ous ness about this .
M a y b e I should to take things co o l ly .
This picture is of a b a b y to m at o in my k it ch en ga r d en .
I p l ant ed some to m at o es , e g g p l ant s and gr e en pe p p er s in A p ri l .
I was un c er tain about the we a ther this sp r ing , and I w or ri ed about whether they would gr ow up well .
F or t un ate ly , some of the to m at o p l ant s have many f r u it s .
To day is ( a ) very good day ! ! !
I ( am ) go ( ing ) to ( an ) ar t school less on tri al in ( the ) morning . .
In or d er to take an ex a m in ation in C o ll e g e of A r t s .
I must become s k i ll ful draw ing r ough s ke t ch ( for the ) ex a m in ation ! !
N e x t I ( will ) go to K A R A O K E with a friend in ( the ) after no on .
I ( will ) s ing a l ot of so ng s ! !
It ' s ex c it ing ! !
The man g a is l o ve story of 1 6 p age s .
I just started to draw it yesterday .
What a bad day !
N e ed less to say , I had to we ar a l ot of c l o th es and make effort to keep my body w ar m before I went to school .
Yes , I was like a s n ow man to day . . .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t understand why my school could n ' t provide w ar m water to all of the students after they had finish ed their p h y s i o l o g ic ally need .
I m a g in e that you have just finish ed p is s ing . When you are going to was h your hand s , you have to let the C O L D water run through your hand s .
What a ' great ' feel ing that is !
The w in d was blow ing against my W E T hand s and I could feel my hand s sha k ing .
I know that I have to cha ll e ng e nature again tomorrow , even if I do n ' t want to face it .
E ver y time I me e t a for e i g n er interest ed in le ar n ing S p an ish and also interest ed in le ar n ing the language in a sp an ish speak ing country , their natural ch o ic e was S p a in .
And I started wonder ing why .
It might be that S p a in is close r to them because in E ur o pe all of the co un t ri es are kind of to g e ther , or because of the c ur re n c y .
But then again , So u th A m er ic a is far , I know , but by p la ne is what 1 3 1 5 hour s away from E ur o pe ?
P la ne ti c ke t , much more ex p en s ive . . .
Then what ?
many things we a p p re c i ate being our s are act u ally the her it age of S p an ish , G er man , or D ut ch im m i g r ant s .
but this mi x of c ul ture s to g e ther with the effect of time over our p op ul ation make us a country ri ch in ar t and ar ch ite c ture .
P le a se if you are p l an n ing to visit a sp an ish speak ing country , don t l o o se the ch ance of dr op p ing in here or in any other ne i g h b or ing country .

To day , I made an `` I r ish b re a k f a st `` for l un ch .

I like this me al so much , but I feel that I r ish b a c on and black ( w h ite ) p ud d ing are a b it s al ty for J a p an e se people , so I eat the b a c on and b re ad to g e ther .

He is g en u in e ly interest ed in other people .
It ' s all about H im , my J a p an e se teacher . . .

I have a pro ble m
I am study ing English w or d s in or d er to get a high s c or e on the T O E F L t est .
But I am having trouble .
It is difficult for me to understand the s c i ent if ic w or d s .
B e c a us e their mean ing s are difficult if I tra n s l ate the w or d s from English into J a p an e se .
F or ex amp le , `` C or i o l is effect `` , `` sp e c t r um `` , e t c .
I c a n ' t quite re m e m b er the se w or d s .
But I want to gradua te from an A m er ic an un ive r s ity , so I will study hard ! ! !
My friend and I visit ed the M or in a g a comp an y , and j o in ed the in fact or y - to ur .
It made me ha p p y because I ' m a ch o c o h o l ic .

I p r a c t ic ed ma k ing a Z o m b i face .
P le a se look at the se picture s .
What do you think ?
I think I ' m a good me n a c ing Z o m b i .
B y the way ,
I c a n ' t ri d myself of j e t la g .
D o you know how to get ri d of it .
P le a se tell me . . . . ! ! !
I ' ve been think ing about writing a b l o g in English , but I was n ' t sure how I could start it .
To day , when I was ne t - s ur f ing for b l o g s in English , I happen ed to find this sit e .
I ma j or ed in so c i o l o g y at So p h i a U n ive r s ity in J a p an since I ' m interest ed in what affect s people ' s de c is ion s to do something or not .
U n f or t un ate ly , I have n ' t a ch i e v ed that yet , but now I ' ve ch o s en English education as my care er and I enjoy my work teaching students .
It was not only out of c ur i o s ity , but also because I did n ' t feel that I f it ted in my s ur r ound ing s well .
I thought that if J a p an was not the be st place to live in , just try another one .
You can ch o o se where you live . You have ch o ic es - that make s you feel at e a se when you find your s el f un f it ted to your circumstance .
If you can speak English , you can live almost every where .
I ' m also interest ed in an a ly z ing ty pe s of so c i e t ies .
I want to think about what ty pe of a so c i e ty J a p an is through my every day ex pe ri ence s , and express my view s on the J a p an e se so c i e ty .
I wish to get fee d b a c k from people who visit my b l o g from over se as and ex change opinion s about J a p an and other co un t ri es .
When I c ut my f ing er , a l ot of b l o o d ra n out . ( 1 )
A t that time , I was was h ing the dis he s , and the s in k became comp le te ly re d . ( 2 )
I was surprise d , and r us h ed into the bath room to was h my hand .
I a p p l i ed a B and - A id , and saw the s in k look ing as if it was the scene of a m ur d er .
( E : ex a m in er , M : me )
M : Yes we do .
My w if e , my two so n s , my mother and I live to g e ther .
M : We all get to g e ther only once a year at my home .
M : Yes , there are a l ot of f a m ous sp ot s .
E : What interest ing place s are there to visit in your home t ow n ?
It re se m ble s N e w Z e al and .
As if the big b l u e mo on speak s to me . . .
I always ch o se a st able way . . .
I ' m always afraid of f a il ur e . . .
I always a v o id my tru e feel ing s . . .
And probab ly , I dis t re s s myself because of this at t it ud e of mi ne .
The mo on light asked me to make a life for myself .
I wonder how many more time s should I see the mo on for me to f in ally take a s te p for w ar d . . .
W h i ch is to night . . .
I only s l ept 5 hour s yesterday because of ch ur ch .
and went to ch ur ch .
H m m I b or r ow ed 2 b ook s for one of the s is ter s who m I know . A n un ?
re m e m b er the s is ter who I told you about ?
The p re t t ies t s is ter who
( da m n , I do n ' t know how to express it . )
2 week s la ter , there will be an ex a m a w a it ing me .
I made up my mind
This was a p op ul ar J a p an e se an im e .
It was in the new s in J a p an , that a man who called himself `` T i g er M as k `` made a con t ri b u tion to an O r p h an age .
To day I had p l ent y of time in the after no on so I took a walk around my home t ow n .
A t first I went to return D V D s which I r ent a f e w days a g o .
And then I went to a b ook st or e which so l d second - hand b ook s .
In fact when I was a high school st ud ent , I be l on g ed to the A m er ic an F o ot b a ll c l u b .
I us ed to be a re p re s ent at ive A m er ic an F o ot b a ll er of my p re f e ture . . . .
It ' s re ally tru e ! !
He has n ' t change d at all .
When I was about to go home , it ' s going to ra in . . . .
I should a v o id to take a bath . . .
The we a ther see m s to be hu m id to day .
S u ch we a ther is not good for me , because I us e a b i ke to co m m ut e .
I have done nothing , but I am ha p p y .
It will be great if I make friend s with English and J a p an e se speak er s .
F or ex amp le , let ' s say you can not get any idea ( of what ) to write in your ent ry on L an g - 8 .
You talk to your s el f , `` a h , I can write nothing on L an g - 8 to day . `` And the explanation of that you can write nothing affect s you .
Some th ing to write about might o c c ur to you if you kept on think ing for a while , but you become un able to get any idea s of what to write re ally d u e to your explanation of , `` I can not `` .
If you o b s er ve your s el f , you may find how you are affect ed by what you talk about to your s el f in every day life .
B e ing an English T e a ch er
One of who is D a v id from E ng l and and the other person is C h in e se .
D a v id is the teacher .
He ' s help ing a C h in e se woman with her English .
She said that she need s to im p ro ve .
I le ar n English not because it ' s us ed every where but because I like it .
I like le ar n ing different language s .
I think I will write more if I have time and when I am in a good mo o d l o l .
L a st day of F e b r u ar y
To day is the last day of F e b r u ar y .
What do you think ?
We ' ve already had two month s of this year go ne .
D o es any on e know of any good way s for me to los e we i g h t ?
I p l an n ed to stop off at the G r and C an y on on the way back to J a p an this J u ly .
But there were no a v a il able sea t s on f light s which would all ow me to go to sight se e ing around L as V e g as .
So I just transfer at L as V e g as . . .
I will mo ve to a new place so I qu it my English con ver s ation school at the end of this month .
My last class was this M on day , but I had to go to my d aught er ' s c r a m school
I like my English teacher , S e an , and I w ro te about him here some time s
H is teaching style is so un i qu e , and I l o v ed the way
he always en c o ur age d me and spoke to me after class .
We enjoy ed cha t ting in those f e w minute s .
When I heard that , I was very ha p p y .
I am very s ad that I could n ' t at ten d the last class
I want ed to express my than k s , and I also want ed to say good by e .
If I know his e - ma il address , I will be able to con ta c t him though . . .
A fter I got mar ri ed , I ' ve mo v ed re pe at ed ly because of my hu s b and ' s business .
This is the se ve n th time .
P e op le tell me that I ' m l u c k y because I can live in many place s , and I can have ex pe ri ence s which other people c a n ' t .
O f course , that ' s tru e , but I ' m not the easy going person that my friend s think I am .
M o v ing some time s works against me .
S e an and I could ma in tain a good re l ation s h i p if I did n ' t mo ve .
I always have to c ut off good re l ation s h i p s by myself , even if I do n ' t want to
In this case , I c ut off two good re l ation s h i p s by myself .
One was my o il pai n ting teacher , and the other was my English teacher .
I ' ll never return here so I ' ll never me e t them again
I know that after pai n ful a se p ar ation , I have other ch ance s to me e t good people .
There f or e , I will be op t im is t ic , and I will ant ic i p ate meeting new people in a new place .
The last f e w days have been strange .
S in ce I came back home , I have been feel ing very l on e ly .
My mother and brother are in I ta ly , and my father ' s re c ent ly work ing almost the who le day out of town and I can only see him for a while every day .
The friend s I ' d like to see are all out of town too .
A t first I thought it would be great to have so much time only for myself and my ho b b ies , but I gradua l ly found out it ' s not that easy .
S in ce I have so much time , I do things I never would have expect ed myself to do at the begin n ing of s um m er ho l i day .
And I re ally do n ' t know why I am try ing because I ' ve never been interest ed in it .
To m or r ow I ' m having my first J a p an e se less on in a long time .
I ' m very ha p p y about it , es pe c i ally because my teacher is a very good friend .
F ir st we saw 8 picture s and gue s s ed what the story was about .
And then , we read a ( this ) ar t ic le .
What story do you picture from the se im age s ?
T w o month s have pass ed since I came here .
I am re ally le ar n ing a l ot , but I some time s wish the class es were a b it more difficult so I could le ar n more .
To day , I j a m m ed with a B ri t ish person at his house because his b and los t their g u it ar is t , so he was look ing for one .
I was surprise d at how people here make friend s .
N e x t month , I have n in e days of va c ation .
I f a il ed to get a W or k ing H o l i day V is a for the U K . . .
It mean s that I can not work there and will have to go back to J a p an in just 6 month s because of a circumstance with my money . If I had got ten the a p po in t ment I could ' ve stay ed up to 2 year s . . . .
It ' s so tra g ic for me .
I ' m feel ing so b l u e de s p ite it being N e w Y e ar ' s . . . .
I have a dr e a m of becom ing a teacher .
O r e m p l o y er of a little sh op .
T h an k you for you visit ing and read ing my me s s age !
I will try to write my di ar y in English to le ar n .
But I c a n ' t write re ally difficult w or d s and sen t ence s .
I ' m not good at English , so please c or re c t my mistake s if you want .
I will be a un ive r s ity st ud ent le ar n ing In ter n ation al s c i ence start ing this sp r ing : )
T h an k s a l ot for all of your help with my English st ud ies , my friend s : )
F al ling in l o ve
A c t u ally , it is just an in f at u ation !
A l th ough I tru st my feel ing s !
She is a new st ud ent at my school .
She is K or e an , while I ' m J a p an e se . . .
How can I make this work ?
1 ) G ive up on her .
2 ) As k her to go out with me .
3 ) I could study the K or e an language
The big g est pro ble m is with the di f f er ence in our language s . . .
How can I express my feel ing to her ?
My im a g in ation can only gr ow ! ^ ^
In conc l us ion , s el f con t ro l and a d a p t ation will le ad to a success ful life .
When you walk on the ro ad to success , there are many te m p t ation s which p re v ent you from do ing what you should do for a success ful life .
With o ut s el f con t ro l you will get side t r a c k ed easily .
When you face o b st a c le s , you should a p p ly an a p p ro p ri ate a d a p t ation in or d er to mo ve for w ar d .
I do n ' t have good e ar s , so I had to listen to the C D again and again in or d er to copy p h r as es and write it on m us ic she e t s .
It took a long time to finish one so ng .
No w , I do n ' t need the she e t m us ic any more .
To enjoy my ho b b y more , I have to do some work first .
I b ough t a voice re c or d er called a line ar P C M re c or d er .
This kind of re c or d er can re c or d your voice and m us ic at the same le ve l as or high er than a C D ' s .
My old er one ' s sound qu al ity was M P 3 , so when I heard the re c or d ed voice s , I had to de al with he ar ing c r a c k ing sound s .

We have to be care ful of he at str o ke the se days .
It ' s im p or t ant that we take water and s al t as of ten as possible to a v o id he at str o ke .

N e w Y e ar ' s E ve
I have a 4 day long N e w Y e ar ho l i day .
G o o d ~ I must or g an i z e m y s ch ed ul e for the se 4 days well .
I am p l an n ing on going to the T a i pe i 1 0 1 p la z a to enjoy a f i re w or k show .
A l th ough it is a little b it c l ic he , as every year I always go there to see the f i re w or k s .
I have no idea what to write about , let ' s just see if I ' m able to pro d u ce con s is t ent English , at least on paper ( on mo n it or , you ' d rather say : ) ) .
A l th ough I do n ' t like the se co m m er c i al i z ed sit es that off er everything in the for m of s ever al easy s te p s , I have to a d m it that the va st , help ful co m m un ity easily over c o m p en s ate s for it : )
As I have not ic ed , people like to b re a k things into paragraph s here , some time s de d ic at ing one for each sen t ence .
This is my first di ar y ent ry on L an g - 8 .
So I s l ept 1 2 hour s !
O ur bu s ra n through va st s te p pe and I enjoy ed p an or a m ic view s from there .
A ll an im al s I saw in M on g o l i a seemed co m f or t able . .
E a ch time when I re m e m b er the e ar th qu a ke , it always feel s pai n ful , because of the ho r ri ble scene s that I ex pe ri ence d and saw from T V and D V D s of ten appear in my mind , and I can hard ly for g e t people ' s b l o o d y face s and in c o m p le te bo d ies under the r u in s .
H um an being s are so f r a g i le in the face of natural dis aster .
That e ar th qu a ke change d me a l ot , and it made me re th in k how I should live and what the most im p or t ant things in my life are .
I think it ' s ne ce s s ar y for me to write down what happen ed and what I ex pe ri ence d in may , 2 0 0 8 , because it will re le a se something in my de e p heart and I re ally need a re le a se . The se things have de p re s s ed me so long , and I must un l o ad them now .
A co up le of days a g o , I dis c us s ed f o o d with my F il i p in o on line t ut or .
While we were dis c us s ing , our to p ic change d to f a st f o o d .
So , when I talk ed with him about M a c D on al d ' s , he sh ar ed a very s c ar y v id e o c l i p from You T u b e .
However , natural f re n ch f ri es and a ha m b ur g er ro t quick ly , but M a c D on al d ' s f o o d ' s ro t ting sp e ed s is very s l ow .
The s c ar ies t stuff is M a c D on al d ' s f re n ch f ri es .
I think the guy is from my favor ite do c u ment ar y , `` S up er S i z e M e `` .
I re ally think that there is l ot of c he m ical stuff in M a c D on al d ' s f o o d .
However , I do u b t it ' s only M a c D on al d f o o d , but another f a st f o o d as w e ll .
However , I de f in ite ly need to think about where and what I ' ll eat .
This was after a de c ad e since our last con ta c t .
He said , `` How are you do ing ?
It ' s been a re ally long time . ``
I said , `` O h , I ' m fine . ``
He re p l i ed , `` I mo v ed to O s a k a from K y ot o and I still work as a m un ic i p al e m p l o y e e .
No th ing , I have no pro ble m .
I just re m e m b er ed you .
So I called . ``
I felt s light ly strange , because he is mar ri ed and he also has a ch il d .
And he has not con ta c ted me for a long time .
If I were him , I probab ly would not have con ta c ted a for m er girl f ri en d
I just re m en b er ed .
The line had al ot of st at ic .
So I said to him , `` Where are you now ?
He re p l i ed me , `` M e ?
On the b al c on y of my a p ar t ment .
It ' s w in d y to day . ``
O R Why did n ' t he consider his w if e and ch il d ?
I con ta c ted a co m m on friend of our s but he said ex was O K .
I think , some time s he act ed ch il d ish ly .
I believe he was into it all along .
I ' ll re c o ver from my lack of sleep and p re p ar e for tax return .
What is your dr e a m ?
To day , I am going to go to a g en er al as se m b ly of you th Y M C A .
F r an k ly speak ing , it is not as str ic t as we think , because the as se m b ly is he l d by you ng students , age s 1 5 to 1 9 .
I ' m 2 0 year s old , but I took a ro le to tea ch them what they should do in you th Y M C A .
I ' ve been a me m b er of you th Y M C A since I was 1 4 year s old ( in K or e a ) .
But as I gradua te from high school and go to a un ive r s ity , I ' ll begin to be bu s y in different place s , with different people and in different way s .
So this as se m b ly may be the last act i v ity I do in this town .
As a st ud ent I ' d been [ felt ] st u c k in you th Y M C A , but the fact that I ' m le aving make s me mi s s it .
However , I ' ll do my be st in this as se m b ly , and de l ive r what I ' d felt while I had been a me m b er of Y M C A .
I also have great ho pe that I can ex pe ri ence new things .
M a k ing English sen t ence s
I start to p r a c t ic e by ma k ing English sen t ence s .
The p r a c t ic e is to tra n s l ate a simple J a p an e se sen t ence to English .
E la b or ate p r at ical p l an s can give you a hand when you face difficult ies or feel de p re s s ed and help you get ri d of un e x pe c ted
It was such a bo l d and cha ll e ng ing p l an so that most people around him did n ' t s up p or t this p l an .
I went to the co m m un ity c ent er this after no on .
I have been s ing ing a so ng once a month with other ch or us me m b er s .
A ll me m b er s are good people and half of them are at a re t i re ment age .
I enjoy ed every time .
O ur re p er t o i re of so ng s is f e w and our s ing ing t al ent is not so good .
But it is a good way to keep a me m b er ' s re l ation s h i p .
It is only once a month and so it is difficult to im p ro ve with each other .
The enjoy able time is im p or t ant .
But 2 4 is a dr a m a with a little b it un us u al sit u ation ( p l ot ) and is very difficult for me to listen to .
J a c k B a u er always say s `` What ' s going on ! ! ! `` : ) .
A l ly M c B e al has a very usual sit u ation ( p l ot ) but I l o ve it al th ough I am a ma le . . .
I would like to listen to more English through e - dr a m as and le ar n more about da i ly con ver s ation and de b ate .
T w o days from now ( 6 / 1 2 ) , my bo y f ri en d will come to my house .
My family go es to l i b r ar y every other week .
We can each b or r ow up to 1 0 b ook s
I finish ed read ing part of the b ook this week , but I have to b or r ow it next time .
in s te ad of a dr um set
I p r a c t ic ed play ing d ur ing short b re a k s between school hour s .
I play ed the b as s dr um part by s te p p ing my sh o es on the floor in s te ad of a b as s dr um .
I play ed the s n ar e dr um part us ing a p en c il and desk in s te ad of a st ic k and s n ar e dr um .
I did n ' t play well , so I ' ve never impress ed other s .
S pe c i ally , I would of ten play the in t ro d u c t or y pass age of ' into the l en s . '
The b a se g u it ar part of that t un e is s y n ch ro n i z ed to the r h y th m of the b as s dr um .
A t the same time , the ke y b o ar d part of that t un e is s y n ch ro n i z ed to the r h y th m of the s n ar e dr um .
But , it does n ' t make me ex cited much . . .
To day , we are hold ing our once - a - month meeting .
I am a J a p an e se high school st ud ent .
I will become a co ll e g e st ud ent next year .
I want to d y e my ha ir and have my e ar s p i er c ed next year .
But I need co ur age to do it .
But I will have f un too !
I am find ing a way to make my le ar n ing pro ce s s more e f f ic i ent .
F or me , p h y s ic s con s is t s of comp le x conc ept s and l ot s of i nformation .
To le ar n it well , I must me m or i z e it .
But I c a n ' t a ch i e ve that , as my me m or y is not good .
I know that I will los e my way if this sit u ation con t in u es .
B e f or e I can do that I have to find the so l u tion
As we know , success will not come s ud d en ly .
I c a n ' t expect success without effort .
B e c a us e this is im p or t ant I have to make an effort to a ch i e ve my go al s .
No w , I find English to be interest ing so I am more mo t i v at ed to le ar n it than in the past .
In fact , the w or d s that I write are to en c o ur g e myself to le ar n .
I do n ' t want to give up my st ud ies .
I have go al s like every on e else .
I us e t w it ter very of ten in a day .
U s u ally , I t w e e t about what I am think ing , and new s ar t ic le s .
F or ex amp le , If I read a new s ar t ic le , and if I feel that it is interest ing : I t w e e t it s ti t le and l in k .
R e c ent ly , I have began to read new s on my i P h on e .
T y p ing on the i P h on e is both er ing for me because my ty p ing sp e ed is very l ow .
So I did n ' t a d d my commen t s when I was read ing new s v i a my i P h on e .
However , my ty p ing sp e ed has im p ro v ed dr a m at ic ally because of train ing us ing an enjoy able a p p l ic ation .
A l th ough the c at is so c ut e , tak ing care of it is a big pro ble m .
And now , I re ally need to keep my room c le an and le ar n how to take care of a c at .
B y the way , his name is M i is e y .
It S t ar t s to day !
I can speak English a little , but re c ent ly I have to read English b ook s more and more .
I ' m a sen i or st ud ent at So o ch ow U n ive r s ity . I ma j or in teaching C h in e se as a for e i g n language and in ter n ation al tra d e .
R es p on d ing To The A r t ic le , ( ' B e a ut i ful T h ing s W or k B e t ter ' )
In respon se to the ar t ic le ' B e a ut i ful T h ing s W or k B e t ter ' , as a teacher myself , I could not agree more .
The year s sp ent in the de s p er ate sea r ch for better te ch n i qu es , the very p r a c t ic e of teaching with it s am a z ing up s and sleep less down s , has de f in it ive ly pro v ed that le ar n ing as such , take s place so le ly in f a v o ur able s ur r ound ing s .
The point on which I could take is s u e with the a u th or lie s in how to c re ate the right en v ir on ment for the language a c qu is i tion to happen , give n that each person is str i k ing ly different .
The thing I feel strong ly about is that it see m s un f a ir to v il if y tra d i tion al education on the gr ound s that it f a il s to me e t every st ud ent ' s need s .
N ever th e less , if we da re take a close r look at c re at i v ity , ( and what is le ar n ing if not a f as c in at ing mi x ture of ex pe ri ment ing , for m ing , sha p ing , pro d u c ing and the like ? ) , then we have to a d m it that , in the long run , success is not a be d of ro se s , al b e it high ly re w ar d ed in the end .
S h or t stay in S en e g al
I will go S en e g al for two month s this ( coming ) f a ll / a ut um n .
I will have to dis c us s some / a f e w de ta il s with my ho st re se ar ch er .
My f light is con f ir m ed as per the at ta ch ed f i le .
R e g ar d ing the hotel , I would like to in qu i re about another de ta il .
O ur comp an y will only co ver a c c o m m o d ation and f light ex p en se s .
a new fashion t re n d is coming to Tokyo now .
P le a se let me know if you think it ' s good or bad .
To day , I got on a train .
But all girl s were us ing their mo b il es .
And train c re w s did n ' t tell them to stop us ing their mo b il es .
S t ud ent from A m er ic a
So I talk ed with her a little .
I will try hard er tomorrow !
I want to im p ro ve my speak ing ability .
What should I do ?
If you have time , please give me a little a d v ic e .
I know , I los t him comp le te ly .
Even though we b ro ke off two year s a g o .
But now , I know I mi s s him , I don t want los e con ta c t with him .
To m or r ow is our ho l i day , I should very ha p p y with my family , but I c a n ' t feel ha p p y .
I want to c ry .
and act u ally I had a good c ry in my office this after no on .
I went into a sh op and asked a lady c l er k for direction s , and she kind ly off er ed me a l if t to my de st in ation !
M o st of the name s of l and s are M a or i name s and I found that they sound quite f a m il i ar , being a J a p an e se n at ive .
A bout half of the people I saw walk ing down the street s were As i an .
I just re c or d ed a C D .
I just had dinner and sat down at my / the desk .
I can feel a ch i ll e ar ly in the morning .
I like the we a ther in the f a ll .
It make S me sen t im E n t al and mo o d y .
So I just re c or d ed a C D .
While I was dr i v ing the c ar , I of ten us ed to listen m us ic .
H a ve you heard of S ting the m us ic i an ?
He sound s like the f a ll .
or H is voice go es well with the f a ll .
( I ' m not sure A B O U T this sen ten se )
The better my re l ation s h i p s are with my friend s , the hard er it is to say good - by e to them .
R e c ent ly , my English teacher left J a p an , and another teacher is le aving J a p an soon too .
I will have difficult y get ting over this great s ad ness .
How do people get over their gr i e f ?
I re al i z ed that if I am in l o ve with a certain man , there will be a time when I have to say good - by e to that man .
Even if we l o ve each other , or no matter how we are at t r a c ted to each other . . .
I am con f us ed by ro man t ic re l ation s h i p s re c ent ly .
What a s ad sea s on it is ! ! !
I ha te ( the ) r us s i an we a ther .
It ' s M ar ch , but we ' ve just had a very th ic k ( B e t ter : he a v y ) s n ow f a ll .
M a y b e it was even a b l i z z ar d .
To night , I went to a c ur ry re st a ur ant with my friend ( s ) .
There were only a f e w In d i an s there , but they could speak J a p an e se and we could co m m un ic ate with them .
K e e m a c ur ry and c he e se n an ta st es very good ! But the n an is th in and wide , so it get s co l d with in a minute .
And if you dr in k water after eat ing the n an , it a b s or b s the water and become s big g er and big g er in your st o m a ch .
D o you have a f a v o ur ite J a p an e se f o o d ? I re c o m m en d the J a p an e se f o o d ' T empura ' : )
My k n if e is of very good qu al ity , and is pretty hand y as well .
S e e ing the man walk ing in public with a k n if e , a ne i g h b or called the police im m ed i ate ly .
It is said that an a d e qu ate work o ut can le ad to a he al th i er life .
I think walk ing is the e as ies t work o ut for almost every on e , from you ng to old people .
When you turn on the p ed ome ter , it co un t s your s te p s a ut o m at ic ally .
It is f un , even f un n er than I expect ed .
I re c o m m en d try ing it .
M or e than ten th ous and s s te p s a day is the t ar g e t go al .
B e ing po s it ive is a much more im p or t ant thing than I thought .
The b ook also said that you must not say or even think `` I do n ' t - - - . `` That mean s that you must not f o c us on the ne g at ive side of any stuff .
F or ex amp le , when you are afraid about something , do n ' t think `` I do n ' t have to be afraid . `` but in s te ad you can think `` R e la x ! `` or `` E n j o y . `` A c t u ally , I c a n ' t agree with this easily , but the point is the same thing R o b er t told me before .
If there is water in half of a c up , how do you think ?
To be able to answer the for m er one make s us different .
No w I get what he said some h ow .
I do n ' t have class every F ri day , but I have works h op s in s te ad .
S in ce I watch it with English sub t it le s , it ' s not so compli c at ed to understand the story .
I also have a K or e an friend who like s J a p an e se come d y and m us ic . He can speak J a p an e se well .
I want to im p ro ve my speak ing and listen ing s k i ll s , so I have a question .
D o you think watch ing mo v ies or dr a m as is a good way to study la ng u age s ?
R e m o v ed a c a st
She b ro ke a bo ne in her left ar m two month s a g o .
I re ally l o ve watch ing v id e o c l i p s which en c o ur age and mo t i v ate me .
A ccord ing to the v id e o c l i p , al th ough the woman is 9 0 year s old , she is still do ing well and is still c re at ing hand made v i o l in s .
I her c r a f t s man s h i p is wonder ful .
S in ce I ' m not good at understand ing A r k an s as a c c ent s , I c a n ' t understand what she is saying per f e c t ly .
However , the re p or ter ' s English is very clear , and I can gue s s what she is saying from the re p or ter ' s story .
C an you ma in tain your mo t i v ation like her ?
A fter I watch ed the c l i p , I asked myself that .
However , I some time s los e interest ed in them .
I know that in both pai n ting and le ar n ing English , if I want to m aster them , all I have to do is keep going .
However , it is most difficult , and most people dr op out mi d way .
In the v id e o c l i p she look s b ri g h t and c he er ful .
I re ally would l o ve to be a for e m o st c r a f t s man like her !
As you know , she is a great s ing er .
A t the moment , my favor ite so ng of her ' s is `` If I were a bo y ``
But re al bo y s do n ' t think de e p ly about their girl f ri en d ' s feel ing s .
I part ly agree with it .
B o y s should think more about girl ' s feel ing s , and girl s should make an effort to co m m un ic ate how they ' re feel ing .
E ver y body dr an k and at e a l ot .
C ha ng ing the sub j e c t , I ' m ex ha ust ed to day , because I had a l ot of work b ut everything went well .
It ' s ra in ing
M a y b e a ut um n is coming .
It has ra in ed for three days , and the te m p er a ture dr op s to 1 8 de g re es c ent i g r ad e . It ' s co o l now .
I need to dress with two la y er s of c l o th ing , but I feel co m f or t able .
A t the st or e , a ut um n fashion start to show off ( se ll ) . They were ex p en s ive and I could n ' t a f f or d the p ur se I want ed . It would have b ro k en the b an k .
In my opinion , it was a ri p - off .
I ' ll bu y the a ut um n fashion when the p ri ce s become c he a p er ( when the st or e give s a dis c o un t ) .
I am a fresh man at un ive r s ity .
I got to know this we b sit e s ever al days a g o , and I have got through some ent ri es written by other s .
I will sp en d some time to c or re c t C h in e se le ar n er ' s ent ri es .
B e c a us e I wish more and more people could a p p re c i ate my mother to n gue .
F or the past 5 month s I had been watch ing a M e x ic an te le no ve la ( dr a m a ? ) called T er es a .
She was mean , she lie d to her friend s , and she said her mother was de ad cause she was e m b ar r as s ed of her hu m ble ro ot s .
P l us , she d um p ed the ri ch guy and s ed u c ed his be st friend , who also happen ed to be her s is ter - in - law ' s bo y f ri en d .
So in s um m ar y ( need less to say ) she was a tra m p .
A n y way , this past S un day the no ve la end ed .
My family came to my house and we c ook ed c ar ne as ad a . We were all watch ing T er es a ' s last cha p ter to g e ther , and were ho p ing her to end up home less and l on e ly ( like in the original ver s ion ) , but to our surprise she did n ' t .
It was so un f a ir , she kept the money and the guy .
So what did she le ar n ?
What was the me s s age , be a tra m p and you ' ll s u c ce ed ?
So to end this ent ry , I ' ll just qu o te T er es a ' s mo m : M e da s mi ed o T er es a . . .
3 r d , S um m it G l o b al J a p an re p or ted they would start s el ling in st ant f il m and in st ant came r as under the P o la ro id bra n d in J a p an in 2 0 1 0 .
P o la ro id face d f in an c i al c ri s is and stop p ed s el ling in st ant f il m and in st ant came r as .
I took many picture s with their came r as and f il m .
I re g re t ted that P or al o id stop p ed s el ling their p h ot o g r a p h y pro d u c t s and think if I were a ri ch man , I would bu y the P o la ro id comp an y and con t in u e to se ll their pro d u c t s .
F or t un ate ly there is another ri ch comp an y and it re v ive d P o la ro id .
One of the most at t r a c t ive point s of P o la ro id is that we can see the p h ot o s we take just after we take them .
But now we are us ing di g it al came r as to do that and the run n ing co st to see p h ot o s take n by a di g it al came r a is free while p h ot o s on a P o la ro id came r a co st s us a f il m fee .
Even so P o la ro id has un i qu e at t r a c t ive point s such as the ex c it ing feel ing when we see p h ot o s appear ing on the f il m .
Then I thought re f ri g er at or was re ally like ma g ic , because there are many de l ic i ous f o o d s in it .
A n e ar th qu a ke has happen ed in J a p an .
There has been an e ar th qu a ke in J a p an .
When the e ar th qu a ke happen ed , I was very an x i ous for my w if e and d aught er .
( M a y b e you mean ) But I could n ' t con ne c t with her .
I f e ar ed for both her and my d aught er ' s s a f e ty .
A fter I was all ow ed to leave the comp an y , I left the office a little e ar ly at 5 o ' clock to get to my w if e ' s job .
I went to the S h in a g a w a S t ation from S h i b u y a .
I think it took about 5 hour s .
But we did n ' t me e t there , because the co m m un ic ation ne t w or k s y s te m was n ' t work ing .
A fter a little time had pass ed , we were able to speak to each other by s m ar t p h on e .
( My w if e is J a p an e se , I ' m K or e an )
I had to walk to the same place .
I had re a ch ed home at 5 A M .
So al t o g e ther I had walk ed for 1 0 hour s .
I was ha p p y for my family ' s s a f e ty .
But I am very w or ri ed about the a c c id ent at the n u c le ar p ow er p l ant .
I worry about the ra d i o a c t i v ity .
I was work ing from the morning to no on to day .
I had a f e w job s so it was easy to get tired . .
What I would like to be or what I have to do in the near future .
I ' m a po s it ive think ing man so I ' ll just do what I have to do .
There will always be tomorrow , so we have to be po s it ive .
W h i ch country s l aught er ed more ? J a p an ? or G er man y ?
The his t or i an C h al m er s J o h n s on has written that
it may be point less to try to est a b l ish which W or l d W ar T w o A x is a g g re s s or , G er man y or J a p an , was more b r ut al to the people s it v ic t im i z ed .
It is s ur p ri s ing how we s ter n people are un a w ar e of J a p an e se at ro c it ies while they always comp ar e H it l er to the de v il .
M or e o ver , it is the J a p an e se who w or s h i p the w ar c ri m in al s in a temple sp e c if ic ally bu il t for them .
As if that was n ' t enough , they change d their history te x t b ook s , ( by ) re m o v ing many of their fault s d ur ing W or l d W ar 2 .
In s te ad of a d m it ting it , they ' re just if y it by saying that all they did was le g it im ate a ccord ing to the in ter n ation al law .
I s it le g it im ate to a b d u c t you ng l ad ies from co un t ri es like K or e a and C h in a and se x u ally a b us e them in the w ar place ?
The di f f er ence between G er man s and J a p an e se is that it see m s like the J a p an e se are not as ha m ed of what they did in the past , while G er man s are not only as ha m ed of what they did but also did not for g e t to apologize to v ic t im i z ed co un t ri es , such as P o l and .
A m a z ing ly , in J a p an , the p ri m e mi n is ter has been re p la c ed each year .
A n y way , we have already had four p ri m e mi n is ter s since K o i z um i .
J a p an e se people are now expect ing a new le ad er , and a new er a .
G o o d A m er ic an S h ow .
I ' ve have n ' t been on la ng - 8 for many days .
I have been too bu s y with work and school .
A class m ate told me N I K I T A is a good show .
It ' s name is N I K I T A .
It star s M a g g i e Q .
There are only se ve n set s in the first sea s on .
I was impress ed by the s up er i or the f o c us and sh ut ter sp e ed of the came r a .
I have to pay close at ten tion to a v o id the new came r a being b ro k en by my so n .
It is a ra in y day to day .
I think it ' s very im p or t ant for me to have as many op p or t un it ies as possible to talk to a n at ive speak er , or a person who can speak English f l u ent ly , in or d er to im p ro ve my speak ing s k i ll s .
One such op p or t un ity is a less on with a n at ive speak er .
The se less on s are he l d near ly every S at ur day .
They are t aught by one of five A L T s ( As s is t ant L an g u age T e a ch er s ) who work in public school ing .
The se less on s are a p re c i ous op p or t un ity for me .
W h i ch is why it is very difficult to find n at ive English speak er s .
B e c a us e the less on s have so f e w part ic i p ant s , we have many op p or t un it ies to speak in English .
A fter talk ing , we us e a te x t for va ri ous act i v it ies .
F or ex amp le , we us e it to re m e m b er us e ful express ion s , e ng age in ro le - play , and con st r u c t sen t ence s con tain ing new w or d s .
N e ar the end of the less on , we read an ar t ic le in the new s p a p er and dis c us s it .
The 2 hour s always f ly by quick ly .
I at ten d ed the `` 76 meeting `` to day .
C o m p an y p re s id ent s b or n in 1 976 ga ther ed for it and 2 0 people came .
In every meeting , one make s a present ation about his comp an y . This time I made it .
A fter that , we dr an k to g e ther and had f un .
There was a light s n ow f a ll yesterday at my ne i g h b or h o o d .
So far it has become w in ter .
I watch ed a D V D `` W h o k il led the e le c t ri c c ar ? `` ; this is a do c u ment ar y f il m that de al s with the history of the e le c t ri c c ar , ma in ly f o c us ed on The G en er al M ot or s E V I .
This ty pe of c ar was in v ent ed to re d u ce a ir po ll u tion , the e mission of c ar b on di o x id e into the at m o s p he re about ten year s a g o .
When it was re le as ed at G M , it was a sen s ation but dis a p pe ar ed and the `` H um m er `` was re le as ed in s te ad .
This is said to have been d u e ch i e f ly to the in f l u ence of the B us h a d m in is t r ation and o il comp an ies push ing out this en v ir on ment ally friend ly c ar .
T en year s la ter , now , we are con s c i ous of how we can be `` gr e en `` and P re s id ent O b a m a is going to en c o ur age the in ve n tion of this p l u g - in e le c t ri c c ar .
The f il m is very impress ive explain ing the sit u ation in those days , and how strong po l ic y and comp an ies ' re l ation s are to p ur s u e each pro f it .
S e c on d of all , I ' d like to study fashion de s i g n .
J a p an e se fashion school s do n ' t tea ch fashion de s i g n .
They only tea ch how to make beautiful c l o th es by mean s of saw ing and ma k ing p at ter n s .
I ' d like to turn my idea s into a re al ity f e at ur ing de e p sen se and study how to express the story to every on e c re at ing a strong impress ion .
There f or e I de c id ed to study in a for e i g n country .
L a st night , I do n ' t know what went wrong .
I just could n ' t sleep , even though I us ed many way s to help myself sleep , no ne of them help ed me .
No w , I am in school .
E ver y class , I am sleep ing , I do n ' t know what ' s wrong with me .
I know I c a n ' t do that , but I c a n ' t make myself not sleep in class .
It is close to C h ri st m as .
He answered , `` S e c re t ! `` .
To m or r ow , I only have two class es .
So I will go to K in k a ku - j i temple to g u id e people .
There is a beautiful go l d en p a v il ion there .
C an you see it on the picture ?
That is go l d co ver ing it .
And , there are three st or ies each con s is ting of a s ing le room .
F ir st is the tea ce re m on y room ; second is the im pe ri al room ; th ir d is the s a m ur a i room .
Even if you want to ent er the se room s , you c a n ' t do that .
You can only see it from the outside .
There is a p on d in front of the p a v il ion .
I watch ed the W or l d S er ies last night and as most of you know , the Ya n ke es w on .
A m a z ing ly , M at s u i hi t remark ably well and was ch o s en as the M V P of this W or l d S er ies .
S in ce he had been probab ly the most p op ul ar play er in J a p an before coming to the U S , many f an s were sh ock ed about his de c is ion of le aving the J a p an e se le a gue .
However , most of the people are still ro ot ing for him as `` M at s u i in the Ya n ke es `` .
I was a f an , too , but last night he turn ed into my f o e .
In his M V P in ter v i e w , he said `` I feel like I ' m in a dr e a m . `` That was a night m ar e for P h i ll ies f an s includ ing myself .
A n y way , I enjoy ed watch ing the P h i ll ies ' game s and I want to than k all play er s !
I am going to tra ve l to T ha il and . in J un e .
I have to make a re s er v ation for a hotel in T ha il and .
I in ten d to make a re s er v ation on the In ter ne t .
I would like to request a no n - s m o k ing room with a t w in be d .
We will be ar ri v ing at 6 : 2 5 p . m .
I should go to be d e ar l , even though , I have a l ot of things to do .
I will do my be st so I will be able to co m m un ic ate with my friend s in English f l u ent ly in the near future .
It felt great . *
I am going to con t in u e do ing it for a little while here a fter .
However , I have to take care about s l i p p ing .
I am not p ic k y .
So , I ' d like to eat va ri ous co un t ri es ' f o o d s .
There are many kind of f o o d s sp e c ul i ar to each country in the world .
not c ar ing whether I looked f at or not .
do a co up le more things , but ne g le c ted them per f e c t ly to day .
To im p ro ve our English .
D o you have ti p s for us ? W h i ch c ity do you re c o m m en d ?
Y o g a is in v o gue among my co w or k er s the se days and they are going to the g y m almost every day after work .
They always re c o m m en d me do ing Y o g a , but I ' m afraid I ' m not interest ed in ex er c is e .
G e t ting the new s p a p er from ma il b o x should be the ex er c is e that most I will do .
B e t ter than do ing nothing , ha !
I have to speak English at my office .
I will study hard .
The very begin n ing . . .
It ' s hard to start a new di ar y , es pe c i ally here .
It was a little b it b or ing .
We are ( just ) try ing to c ar ry out an in ter ve n tion al study with a gr o up of 1 5 - 1 6 year old s j u ve n i le de l in qu ent s us ing to the b ook `` E X P L O R I N G F E E L I N G S : the C o g n it ive B e ha v i or The r a p y To M an age A ng er `` , which was tra n s la ted into J a p an e se .
There f or e I have con ta c ted D r / / / / / / , the a u th or of the b ook , so that we would have some a d v ic e for the pro g r a m .
With regard to the ra ting s c al e and s c i ent if ic e v al u ation of the pro g r a m ( to comp ar e the pro g r a m ' s effect before and after ) , he suggest ed that I con ta c t you and ga ve me your e - ma il address .
We are p l an n ing to me as ur e with the S t ate - T r a it A ng er E x p re s s ion In v ent or y - 2 ( S ch w en k m e z g er e t al .
1 99 2 ) for the e v al u ation study , but we are also think ing that it would be a b it difficult for some of the sub j e c t gr o up me m b er s .
That is why , it would be help ful , if you could give us some a d v ic e for the e v al u ation of the re se ar ch and provide the de ta il s about the ra ting s c al es that were us ed in the b ook .
In my opinion , We s ter n you th s have more free d o m than their friend s in the E a st .
In many case s , they have to e ar n money for not only themselves but also their family : they become the ma in e ar n er s .
So some time s they c a n ' t follow their dr e a m s . In s te ad , they get job s they do n ' t like , as long as the job s b r ing them money .
A f e w people do n ' t give up but after s ever al year s , their pass ion is not strong enough .
In other w or d s , they s a c ri f ic e for their family .
They do not want their s i b ling s to make s a c ri f ic es as well .
To day , I ' m going to read a law b ook after I have read l ot s of no ve l s .
No w , I must go to read .
B y e - by e !
Yes ter day ' s English L es s on
Yes ter day my English con ver s ation teacher S e an and I had a very interest ing less on .
He suggest ed to me that I tell a lie in English .
When I told a lie , I was very n er v ous .
B e c a us e I had to make two st or ies where one is tru e and the other is f al se and I also had to tell them in English with same f a c i al express ion , voice to ne and so on .
My st or ies were that ; when I was you ng er , I was a to m b o y and most of my friend s were bo y s .
I like d play ing game s with them and one of my favor ite game s was ma k ing f ro g bo m b s .
I stuff ed f i re c r a c k er s into live f ro g s and th re w them to w ar d s people .
My mo m was always up se t about my be ha v i or .
When I was three year s old , one day I was look ing at a was h ing machi ne and was c ur i ous about it .
W h il st I was watch ing the mo ve ment , I do n ' t know why , but I want ed to try and j um p into the was h ing machi ne .
A t the same time I re c o g n i z ed that I would turn around with the la un d ry .
A ll of my ha ir came out and of course , I heard my mo m ' s s c re a m ing .
On the other hand , when I was you ng er , I wish ed to pe e with stand ing like my bo y friend s .
When I play ed with them , I always pe ed stand ing up .
One day I tri ed to do pe e with one of my bo y friend s from up st a ir s to w ar d s my da d ' s c ar .
We were stand ing on the b al c on y and pe ed .
When my mo m saw our pe e down st a ir s , she was re ally ma d at us .
D o you know which story ( j um p ing into the was h ing machi ne or do ing a pe e w h il st stand ing ) is tru e ?
O f course , I did n ' t speak them in English though .
He ga ve me a copy of the so ng ' s ly ri c s , but I just know how to s ing the begin n ing of the so ng , which go es `` I ' m dr e a m ing of a w h ite C h ri st m as . J ust like the one s I us ed to know . ``
There f or e , I c he c k ed the so ng ' s me l o d y on You t u b e and I ' m p r a c t ic ing now .
I want to read English no ve l s that are written by K ur t V on ne g ut .
I ' ll get an impress ion and know led g e of read ing English te x t , which is my purpose in j o in ing L an g - 8 .
B e c a us e I went to be d l ate .
to day ' s to do l is t
To day I went to see an English speech con t est at a un ive r s ity .
7 students p at ic i p at ed in it and they were great ^ ^ Some students did n ' t me m or i z e their s c ri p t enough not to show it but still I thought they put in a l ot of effort .
The to p ic s were all different , g l o b al w ar m ing , in ter ne t game a d d i ction , s u ic id e and so on .
I could n ' t catch all the w or d s that part ic i p ant s were speak ing but I enjoy ed it and it was re ally in f or m at ive for me to listen to the a d v ic es from the j ud g es .
It ta st es th ic k .
What C an We D o for the To h o ku R e g ion ?
U p to now , the de a th to ll has re a ch ed up to at least f if te en th ous and , and ten th ous and people are still mi s s ing .
A ccord ing to T V new s , there is still a l ot of de b ri s in the de v a st at ed are a .
, It is ne ce s s ar y to re m o ve it im m ed i ate ly so re c on st r u ction can begin .
A l s o , the dis aster had a serious im p a c t on the education en v ir on ment in that re g ion .
B e c a us e of the cha in of natural dis aster s , the ch il d re n in the re g ion have not been able to get enough education .
There f or e , since we have know led g e , we can tea ch them and help them study to some ex t ent ; we will be able to provide them with education .
We can bu y as many pro d u c t s made in the re g ion as we can .
F ir st , let me explain the S R I in de ta il .
However , in addition to the se point s , so c i al con t ri b u tion should also be take n in account .
The for m er in ve st s 1 0 0 yen per piece of c l o th for the To h o ku re g ion .
If we p l an on bu y ing the same kind of a c l o th , we will bu y it from the for m er .
There f or e , if you are interest ed , I would like you to find comp an ies c ar ry ing out S R I
This is my as s i g n ment for my un ive r s ity
If you have time , please c or re c t my mistake s !
us ing ce ll p h on es in school
Why can ` t we us e ce ll p h on es at high school ?
C er tain ly , it is not good to us e it
d ur ing class time ,
but I think that there is no reason not to us e ce ll p h on es d ur ing re st time and co m m ut e .
I c a n ' t speak English well .
I can give good c or re ction s in J a p an e se .
W ow , I ' m look ing more for w ar d to it than to the W or l d C up game .
This T V pro g r a m is very f a m ous in J a p an . it is called `` K in - cha n no Ka s ot a ish o `` ( How do I say in English . . .
In this v id e o , m ul t i p le people are perform ing to g e ther to for m a s k it of a girl f ri en d going c r a z y on her bo y f ri en d .
She ' s th r ow ing water , a p l ate , p i z z a , sp a g he t t i e t c .
C o m ing home , my w if e and I talk ed about the people we me t at S ar a h ' s w ed d ing .
It ' s been near ly ten year s since we got into the U n ive r s ity , but some do n ' t see m to be gr ow ing up .
It may be asked whether I am gr ow ing .
I sure ly can say ' y es , I am ' at least in some are as . Well , it ' s not that I am pro ud of myself but I am hung ry for gr ow th .
I work as an as s is t ant of a pro j e c t man age ment tea m , and writing meeting not es is one of my ma in ta s k s .
There is a meeting almost every day , but it ' s still hard for me to understand what they are talk ing about .
That ' s why a voice re c or d er is a ne ce s s ar y it e m .
What would you do if I said l o ve .
To day is the first day to work in S ing a po re .
The re s ul t is not so bad .
F o o d and life is good for me .
I had a dinner at a f o o d - co ur t .
I said `` C an I have a take - out of this ? `` .
( I do n ' t know if this p h r a se is right or not )
Then the s ta f f person said `` take a way ? ``
A re the se different ?
C an any on e help me with my question ?
D if f ic ul t !
This is my first time writing a di ar y in English .
B e c a us e of this , I w o n ' t write a long da ir y .
I w o n ' t go out to day .
he y ~ , How about the we a ther where you live ?
When I was a un ive r s ity st ud ent , I be l on g ed to the y a ch t c l u b .
A l m o st every me m b er had not y a ch ted before they j o in ed our c l u b .
However , we have had a go al that we will w in a place in the n ation al ch amp ion s h i p .
We have not a ch i e v ed the go al but we will cha ll e ng e it .
I go to stand ing b ar s once or t w ic e a week .
I like stand ing b ar s more than re g ul ar b ar s because it is c he a p er and I can co m m un ic ate with other c ust ome r s .
Some time s there are for e i g n er s at stand ing b ar s , and I get a ch ance to talk to / with them .
Some of my friend s , name ly H and F , and I had made p l an s to go on a 2 - day tri p to S en d a i d ur ing the long 5 - day week en d , from S ept e m b er 1 9 th to the 2 3 r d .
Yes ter day F sen t an e - ma il to H and me .
A ccord ing to F ' s e - ma il , F s ud d en ly had to make a business tri p from S ept e m b er 2 0 th , and F asked us to re s ch ed ul e the tri p to S ept e m b er 2 2 n d and 2 3 r d .
So we made p l an s again to go to O d a w ar a for a day on S ept e m b er 2 2 n d .
It take s around 2 hour s to get to school by train .
So in the train , I do things like read a b ook , listen to m us ic and so on .
I c he c k ed my e m a il , study ed and then s l ept to day .
In addition , I ' m also writing in my j o ur n al !
I started le ar n ing English at the age of 1 3 which is the age of j un i or high school students in J a p an .
S in ce there were not many for e i g n er s in my c ity at that time , I felt le ar n ing English was re ally fresh .
I gradua ted from un ive r s ity , and at the same time , I qu it study ing English .
However , I re st ar ted study ing English to im p ro ve my life since I understand how English is im p or t ant in a g l o b al so c i e ty .
B o th the read ing pass age and the le c ture r in the listen ing part re f er to a question that di no s a ur s are either w ar m - b l o o d ed re p t il es or not .
The read ing pass age ar gue s that di no s a ur s are like to day ' s ma m m al s and b ir d s , w ar m - b l o o d ed an im al s , but the le c ture r hold s an op po s ite point of view and ma in tain s that this the or y is not very per s u as ive .
He re f ut es what is cited in the read ing pass age ; the f o s s il in So u th D a k ot a in 1 993 is the e v id ence that can s up p or t that the or y .
The le c ture r ' s second point is that di no s a ur s do not have to a d a p t un st able c l im ate , such as how s n a ke s and l i z ar d s do to day .
C on t r ar y to what is me n tion ed in the read ing pass age , that only w ar m - b l o o d ed an im al s can s ur v ive from the f ic k le te m p er a ture at that time , he op in es that the we a ther at that time was re l at ive ly mo d er ate than to day ' s , mean ing that there was no ex t re m e sh if t between high and l ow in te m p er a ture .
Besides , the f a st - cha ng ing we a ther te m p er a ture was never re c or d ed .
L a st but not the least , the le c ture r con ten d s that a big body s i z e does not ne ce s s ar i ly mean having a w ar m ed - b l o o d s y s te m .
He agree s with the opinion of the read ing pass age that g i ant body need s a con st ant body te m p er a ture ; however , he believe s di no s a ur s like big sea t ur t le s have a l ow r ation of s ur f a ce to v o l um e , which can re d u ce he at - los s , and that is able to keep them in a st able body te m p er a ture .
R e c ent ly , I ' ve been watch ing `` F R I E N D S `` , an A m er ic an dr a m a s er ies .
Some ma g a z in es re c ome n d ed watch ing F R I E N D S to le ar n English ,
B e c a us e it s w or d ing is not difficult and they speak natural English .
As a matter of fact , it is e as i er to listen to and understand what the act or s say
than in other dr a m as such as `` B O N E S `` ( in which there are too many te ch n ical terms ) .
I also enjoy it very much because the p l ot it s el f is very funny .
However , there is one pro ble m . . .
The j o ke s are some time s very difficult to understand , es pe c i ally the b l u e j o ke s .
They require us to have the a p p r or p a ite c ul t u al back g r ound or understand un i qu e v o c a b ul ar y .
This re m in d s me of an a ne c d o te / incident .
a man told a j o ke but I just star ed at him b l an k ly .
In the future , when I can enjoy every j o ke in F R I E N D S ,
I re ally will have a c qu i re English s k i ll s .
I ' m A k i .
but English ( it ) is very difficult for me ! !
I ' d like to cha ll e ng e myself to take the T O E I C t est .
She said that she like s to take the T O E I C t est because she get a l ot of en er g y from tak ing it .
She has been study ing English for 3 hour s a day .
I c a n ' t study English for even an hour .
Even if I have time to study English I will simpl y not do it .
A f e w days a g o I b ough t a C D and a ra d i o play er .
I want ed to listen some m us ic in the bath room .
So I ' m feel ing like sp en d ing a ha p p y bath time to w ar m body .
( not only having a show er , but so a k ing in a full ta b of w ar m water )
It ' s funny how I sp en d my bath time , is n ' t it ?
D e c id ed on a school
To day , I finish ed the tri al less on at last .
And I de c id ed on a language school .
My ch o ic e of school is L S C .
But L S C was different .
I have never watch ed a ma j or le a gue game .
C o ul d you explain the mean ing and give me some ex amp le s of it s us age ?
T O E F L writing a w a it s your re v is ion ! !
I strong ly dis a g re e that the help from go ver n ment is of ten not ne ce s s ar y since most people can so l ve their pro ble m s by themselves or with the help of their f a m il ies .
On the con t r ar y ( or In con t r ar y ) , I believe that even if people receiv e help some where else , the help from go ver n ment , in some case s , is what c it i z en s need most , because of go ver n ment ' s t re m en d ous p ow er s .
Besides , off er ing va ri ous help is a go ver n ment ' s o b l i g ation , whether it ` s ne ce s s ar y or not .
I w o ke up at 4 : 0 0 a . m . to go s ur f ing this morning , but the w a ve s were too small .
I in ten d ed to s ur f before going to work , but I could not .
A fter work , I in ten d ed to s ur f again , but it was w in d y .
R e c ent ly , I have n ' t been s ur f ing .
A fter I work 4 more days , there is 9 - day week en d .
I c a n ' t wait .
I just j o in ed L an g - 8 !
I ' m not sure how to us e L an g - 8 yet .
I ' ve started study ing English in C an ad a this month !
My English is poor , but I ' ll study hard .
That ' s why it is my first time to day .
It see m s very help ful
I ho pe I can keep us ing it .
L a st night , I went to s us h i b ar with my co w or k er s and bo s s ( ? ) .
That w as a great time .
I le ar n ed a l ot from them .
In J a p an , when you are going to make a to a st , you have to pay at ten s ion to your position .
If you ar e the you ng er one , your g la s s should be a little l ow er than the other s ' .
It is the way to s ur v ive in business my bo s s said .
I do n ' t w an n a go out , so just watch ing mo v ies to day !
My s k in is not good .
I of ten go to de r m at o l o g y c l in ic s or us e s k in care pro d u c t s .
I re ally want my s k in to become s m o o th !
U n f or t un ate ly my s k in has become dr y , dr y and dr y . . . ! ! ! ! ! !
I have co l d s with run n y no se and head a ch e .
On the other hand , a ccord ing to re c ent re se ar ch , V i e t n a m ' s p op ul ation is get ting old f aster than any other country .
It ' s un e x pe c ted ly difficult to c or re c t j a p an e se
To day , I c or re c ted some j a p an e se ent ri es .
but , it ' s un e x pe c ted ly difficult to c or re c t
The reason is that J a p an e se has va ri ous express ion s in one te x t .
m m m .
B y the way ,
I was am a z ed that there are many j a p an e se ent ri es .
I think it ' s wonder ful .
I think that tak ing an interest in such a different c i v il i z ation is a very great way for us to understand each o ther better , and be ha p p i er .
P le a se do n ' t p i le up the dis he s
She is a very w ar m - heart ed person .
But she is n ' t good at house w or k , es pe c i ally was h ing the dis he s .
Yes ter day a l ot of us ed dis he s were p il ed up on the k it ch en s in k and I could n ' t be ar those left for a day .
So it ur g ed me to was h the dis he s and de al t with them r ough ly with a ng er .
1 0 minute s la ter , my w if e came a cross me and show ed me a w h ite c up .
She told me that it was give n to her by her gr and m o ther who was already de ad .
My s um m er ho l i day s were too short , as usual ; - )
The reason why my school start s on T h ur s day is , p up il s with the gra d e 5 in their school re p or t s can make a t est about the who le last year to get in the next high er class .
I am le ar n ing E le c t ro n ic s with In f or m at ic s and C o m p ut er te ch n i qu es .
The A ust ri an school s are very un ive r s ally that we know from everything a little .
It con s is t s many te ch n ical a c k n ow led g ment s , but also sub j e c t s as G er man , English and E c on o m y will be asked .
But that the hard est and the most f e ar s ome t est is the `` F T K L Project `` ( tra n s la ted in English : M an u f a c t ur ing and C on st r u ction D o c t ri ne ) .
A fter pass ing all t est s , I can de c id e to start work ing or go to a un ive r s ity .
But I think I will ch o o se work ing because I am already sick of study ing > . <
A d d i tion ally , after 2 year s work ex pe ri ence , I will get a ut o m at ic ally the ti t le `` E ng in e er `` .
I kind of thought that , as long as I write something in English , some on e would c or re c t my English while sleep ing .
but I gue s s that ' s too good to be tru e .
That ' s kind of s ad because this is about in ter a c ting with re al people ,
I gue s s I have to take a ction in or d er to find some on e to c or re c t my English ?
Y e a h , let me find some on e who need s my help .
Some on e who is study ing J a p an e se in this case ?
A ll right , where are they ?
C an I just say he ll o to them ?
O r a d d them ?
I s n ' t it kind of a w k w ar d ?
You do n ' t have to c or re c t my English .
J ust tell me how to us e this we b s ite first !
My be st friend is coming from J a p an in a week s time .
She is the first person to visit me since I came to A ust r al i a .
It ' s not very long , but still , I am so ex cited to be see ing her .
We went to the same high school but went to different co ll e g es .
She is now work ing for the same b an k that I was work ing for .
However , on the first day , she is just le aving J a p an l ate in the even ing , and on the last day , she need s to take an e ar ly f light , so , we have got three full days off to g e ther .
I wonder if 3 days will be enough .
So I was surprise d at how much it ' s change d ! !
I ' m enjoy ing my s um m er va c ation , but I have a l ot of things to do .
F ir st , I must do my home w or k .
We have an as s i g n ment to write a b ook re v i e w .
I like read ing b ook s , but I ha te this home w or k !
I do n ' t know what to write . . .
To m or r ow , my ch il d h o o d friend s are coming for a visit .
We are going to the k ar a o ke .
So , I w o n ' t be able to do my home w or k tomorrow .
I ' ll start study ing right now . . .
C h ic k en C ur ry , S a f f ro n ri ce with J a p an e se p ic k led p l um , mi x ed dr i ed f r u it s N an , pe p p er m in t cha i with c in n a m on and sh o ch u , J a p an e se sweet p ot at o w in e with k a b o s u , an O it a p re f e c ture pro d u c ed f r u it that is just like a le m on .
I ' d like to sleep more , but at the same time , I want to le ar n English more .
I ' m try ing to do everything if it ' s possible .
My heart is be at ing now
It has been be at ing since yesterday .
The reason why I am so is that my close friend has give n me a g if t for my English study .
But may be I have to get first ex pe ri ence .
So my heart is be at ing .
S ad N e w s
I receiv ed some very s ad new s from my friend in Tokyo .
A ccord ing to her , one of our class m ate s in our pai n ting school di ed because of can c er .
A c t u ally , I talk ed to her just last month .
To be honest with you , I did n ' t like her because she was the kind of person who said what ever was on her mind .
So , I was we a k around her .
When I cha t ted with her last time , it was my first time to have see n her in six month s .
I live far from Tokyo , so I can not at ten d her f un er al .
L ate ly , I ' ve had a run n y no se .
S ne e z ing see m s to be my ro ut in e .
I s ne e z e all day and night .
In fact , I am all er g ic to co l d a ir , so every time some on e s w it ch es on the A C , I will s ne e z e la ter .
A f e w days a g o , I p l u c k ed my no se ha ir because it was too long .
M a y b e I hu r t the inside of my no se .
The most ex a g g er at ed thing is the ti s s u e I us ed to blow my no se became a mo is t to w e le t te .
I wonder if it can be c ur ed with time .
When I was a second ar y ( school ) st ud ent , two teachers t aught us English at the school .
M a in ly , J a p an e se teacher t aught English gra m m er , a c c ent s and va ri ous w or d s .
A no ther teacher who came from an English speak ing country ( may b e the U .
I had never me t a for e i g n er unti l then , as I live d in a small town in J a p an .
The J a p an e se teacher talk ed and talk ed to us in J a p an e se for the who le class .
I did nothing ex c ept for writing down what the teacher explain ed .
I always want ed to have a pe t at home .
My mother was very s c ept ic of this idea , but my father full f il led my dr e a m by bu y ing me a beautiful do g . I was very ha p p y , and I sp ent almost all my time with my F ri en d . : )
But one day my do g dis a p pe ar ed , and now I c a n ' t find him any where .
I mi s s my F ri en d . I look for him through the w in d ow every day . . .
a y a m i ' is my s c re en name and my re al name is A y a .
may b e I ' ll us e both here . . .
I ma j or in English and A m er ic an di p l o m a c y & history .
I am going to the un ive r s ity of G e or g i a this A u g ust .
to day , it was so o o o co l d and there were a l ot of s n ow in O s a k a .
so I have been at home all day listen ing to the new al b um of D a v id G u e t ta ! ^ ^
I can not b or r ow it even if it has already been c he c k ed out for three or four month s .
To make matter s w or se ,
I have been made to b or r ow six b ook s all in one day .
A ll the se are s light ly s ever e there for two week s . ( ? )
But it was the b ook which every on e want s to read .
I will con g r at ul ate you start ing next year .
I do n ' t like dr in k ing very much but I say he ll o , and he say s let ' s ( have a ) dr in k if you have time .
A l th ough I do n ' t like dr in k ing , I like meeting my friend s .
I ' ll c he er you on .
My name `` G al le `` is name d after a be a ut y s al on I go to .
I am a st ud ent at a J a p an e se un ive r s ity .
But my English is bad es pe c i ally when it come s to speak ing , so I can have no w or d s when ever I try to speak in English !
So , I want to study mo d er n English on this we b s ite .
I ' ll write di ar ies as much as I can / as much as possible .
P le a se c or re c t my mistake s !
To day , I ' ve started L an g - 8 .
My English le ve l is like a b a b y . . .
To begin with , I ' ll study some w or d s !
And try some c or re ction s !
I will take the T O E F L next week en d ! O h my go d !
A l th ough I am not good at English act u ally , but I just want to try and to know what le ve l I am .
I feel n er v ous because this is the first time I will take it .
I ho pe it will go well !
I me t with my friend last night .
We had n ' t me t for a long time .
My friend is work ing at a b an k and I am study ing for ex a m s .
It was very n ic e to see her .
We talk ed about many things .
It has been t ough for her to work but she is look ing for something sp e c i al .
Some th ing like what she dr e a m s of .
A l s o I do my be st to make my dr e a m s come tru e .
I think that ma k ing dr e a m s come tru e is difficult and need s hard work .
I thought that as I was read ing a b ook at a l i b r ar y .
`` D re a m is eat ing be ad s of s w e at ( your effort ) , not a ra in b ow . ``
It was easy enough to understand and quite ent er tain ing to watch .
I hu r t my bo y f ri en d ' s feel ing s .
I could n ' t stand his at t it ud e and I sen t him re ally bad w or d s through an e m a il .
`` I know we have different va l u es and thought s ,
but this is the w or st person to i g no re the question of what they ' re as k ing .
So I try not to re a c t no matter who I like or not .
But , you know , there ' s a person like that who never care s for other s .
It was about him but I never re f er r ed to that because I just want ed him to
A fter sen d ing the e m a il I felt better , al th ough he did n ' t re p ly .
In the even ing I found out that he had dis a p pe ar ed .
I looked around and I found him in a b ook room , and he was ar r an g ing it . ( We ' re going to mo ve another bu il d ing this month of 1 3 th . ) I spoke to him , he seemed to get a ng ry .
He seemed to be c ry ing because I not ic ed that his eyes tea r ed up .
I re al i z ed my w or d s hu r t his feel ing s . . .
I just want ed him to not ic e my heart .
He was a p p ar ent ly down and I propos ed going to dinner .
We need ed to talk to each other yesterday .
If we mi s un d er st o o d each other , that would le ad us to a b re a k up .
I spoke to him about my tru e feel ing s that I have felt the se days .
I tri ed to be honest and sha re my thought s .
He has always care d what he did to me , and some time s he felt sorry for me .
And he said to me , `` I was going to b re a k up with you , act u ally . `` J ust j o k ing , but when I heard this , I re al i z ed how mean I was to him . .
I re al i z ed that I was being re ally s el f ish , and when I saw his tea r s , I was re ally as ha m ed of myself .
When I b ro ke up a friend s h i p with a bo y friend in co ll e g e , he said to me , `` you ' re always think ing about your s el f .
This was one of the most de p re s s ing ex pe ri ence in my life and since then I tri ed to keep that in mind about this .
Even if I l o v ed him I re ally , did n ' t tru st him from the bo t t o m of my heart .
I ' ve always want ed his re p ly , and re a ction because I want to find out his thought s , view s and va l u es .
Even though , this was bad some h ow I ' m still re l i e v ed
to tell him about my thought s
I went to a for t un e te ll er last night with my friend s .
And I got n ic e i nformation about my future .
R e c ent ly , J a p an e se ten d to say that it ' s in c on s id er ate to have an even t or f est i v al or such kind s of things .
I understand why they would say so , but do they not re al i z e it will make s u f f er er s of the e ar th qu a ke face an even hard er sit u ation ?
S el f - c en s or ing an even t make s e c on o m y de c line .
A de c l in ing e c on o m y make s people un ha p p y , includ ing s u f f er er s .
I ' m con f us ed !
One of my friend s asked me a question .
I thought about it but I could n ' t find a proper answer .
If you read my b l o g please c or re c t her answer for me .
He r question is the mean ing of the sen t ence be l ow and if the sen t ence is c or re c t or not .
This sen t ence is print ed on her so n ' s T - shirt .
One day when her so n ' s English teacher saw that T - shirt , he took picture s of it and said it was so funny !
So my friend is an x i ous about the mean ing of that is ent ence and want s to know if it has D o you mean `` s la ng `` and `` bad w or d s `` ?
I tri ed to tra n s l ate it but it ' s a little b it compli c at ed .
I ' m sorry to both er you .
L on g time since I ' ve been here
because my work kept me very bu s y .
And I started a new b l o g in J a p an e se here .
B e c a us e I read them tra n s la ted to J a p an e se s ever al time s , I can read them without a di ction ar y .
S t ud y ing English
I ' ve been to U S A three time s with in two month s .
I think I will im p ro ve by j o in ing up la ng - 8
I was the first c ar at the sign al in the right la ne to make a turn right there .
Then , what happen ed was that the c ar on my left pass ed my c ar and turn ed right on the re d sign al .
This c ar was in the middle la ne at the time .
L a st se m est er , things got very me s s y .
I might not be able to keep my pro m is e for the who le se m est er , but I ' ll try .
I might try to raise the number of ent ri es per week , after I get a de c ent know led g e of S p an ish .
I did n ' t even have time to think about pro c r a st in at ing there .
But as the gr o up F la w less from B ri tain ' s G ot T al ent said , `` C ha se the dr e a m , not the comp e t i tion . `` I just ho pe that I can make it . No t ne ce s s ar i ly before the end of the comp e t i tion , but it ' d be n ic e if it was a c c o m p l ish ed in time for my gradua tion pro j e c t .
I keep push ing myself to be op t im is t ic , but there are some moment s when I find this very difficult . T h ough , who does n ' t ? !
This qu ot ation is the only thing that keep s me going .
I ho pe it does the same for you .
F or t C un n ing p ar k and M a c R it ch i e re s er v o ir
Yes ter day , my hu s b and and I visit ed F or t C un n ing p ar k and M a c R it ch i e re s er v o ir .
B o th were beautiful nature p ar k s and we had a good time there .
In the morning we started our walk to F or t C un n ing i nformation c ent er to get a ma p .
It was l un ch time , so I went to the F or t C un n ing c l u b house where there were some re st a ur ant s and a b ar .
U n f or t un ate ly , it was being re no v at ed !
We quick ly looked on the ma p for other re st a ur ant s and found one .
A t last we ar ri v ed .
It was a n ic e look ing re st a ur ant on a hi ll s ur r ound ed by a beautiful for est .
It was a co l on i al style ( S ing a po re co l on i al house is called black and w h ite ) and found ed in 1 9 0 8 .
If the re st a ur ant had not been close d , we could have had l un ch on the ter r a ce !
The re st a ur ant was close d every S un day !
We want ed to eat anything any where , so we had l un ch at a near b y M c D on al d ' s ( my hu s b and like s ma c ) .
A fter l un ch , we took a walk around the p ar k .
I took many picture s in a da z e .
On the way , I happen ed to see a tra d i tion al M al a y w ed d ing outside .
It was so wonder ful !
We had time to go to another place , so we went to M a c R it ch i e re s er v o ir near our house .
A t the re s er v o ir , we re n ted a p ad d le boat .
We p ad d led the boat and it was a l ot of f un !
The re s er v o ir was in the for est , so it felt like we were ex p l or ing a j un g le or something .
This is the first time since my mother came home from the ho s p it al .
A l th ough we need to `` be `` back home by six , my d aught er s enjoy ed it with my p ar ent s .
We also visit ed the gra ve `` in `` which my gr and p ar ent s sleep .
G o d , I ' m so sleep y .
I always feel sleep y when I have some work to do . ( H ome w or k or c le an ing my room , e t c . . )
A l s o , I can f a ll as le e p in a f e w minute s when I try to read a b ook , k k k k k : )
A fter the English class in which I could not even understand what the p rofessor said , I p re p ar ed for the class by read ing a b ook and think ing about what I ' d say .
I ' m just wait ing for C h us e o k , K or e an T h an k s g i v ing D a y .
It is not co m f or t able here for me , it is too small and too no is y .
But I ' m also re ally enjoy ing this life , read ing some j o ur n al s and talk ing to you guy s !
They are all good people here .
My old est so n is 4 year s old , and you ng er 2 .
When my w if e was p re g n ant , `` just like all the other hu s b and and father `` , I thought everything was going to be beautiful just like on T V .
But , after 2 so n s , what I im a g in ed pro v ed as such an i ll us ion .
F ar from talk ing and eat ing around the dinner t able with my l o ve ly family gra ce ful ly , I can hard ly eat my me al s to s ur v ive .
I be t any body who has ch il d re n ( es pe c i ally more than 2 ) can understand ex a c t ly what I am saying now .
R e al ity is a who le l ot different from im a g in ation .
S e e ing me and my w if e play ing loud ly ( may b e my first ch il d seemed to have thought we were qu ar re ling ) , he said to me `` D ad d y ,
I do n ' t want you to hu r t mo m m y . ``
That made my eyes water .
We have to le ar n a ch il d ' s thought ful consider ation for other s and f r an k ness about it , because we know consider ation and f r an k ness always work .
I like t o talk to po e p le from other co un t ri es .
a d d me please : )
I believe that most people like play ing on line game s .
I always want to find new on line game s to play .
However , it is not easy to find a game that is interest ing
F or now , I want to find some on line game s from for e i g n co un t ri es .
But un f or t un ate ly , they are so difficult to find , even if I us e a sea r ch e ng in e such as y a h o o or go o g le .
So , can you in t ro d u ce some interest ing and ex c it ing on line game s to me ?
I was sit ting on the bu s and watch ing the T V in the bu s .
I did not not ic e a th i e f had be g un to c ut my b a g .
When I found this , my b a g had been s c r at ch ed by the th i e f .
F or t un ate ly , I did n ' t los e anything .
The th i e f had already go ne away when I not ic ed my b a g was b ro k en .
This is the th ir d b a g which has been c ut by a th i e f .
He ll o E ver y on e !
I got a day off from yesterday .
Y e a h ! !
I me t up with a friend , and we went to the c in e m a to g e ther .
Why did I watch a mo v i e ? ? What do you think ? ? I like come d ies ! ! ! I will get another day off in 4 days . . .
I w an n a go on a tri p ! ! ! But I can not get a long va c ation ( > o < ) . If you can get a long va c ation , what would you do ? ? ( ^ o ' ) b
I like to read man g a .
My favor ite man g a is D r a g on B a ll ,
I me t my con ver s ation part n er ( st ud ent t ut or ) , A m and a , for the first time .
( She stood me up ! ) I thought that might happen because we had set a d ate at the begin n ing of last week .
F or that reason , I was re ally look ing for w ar d to see ing her .
On the first day , we did not work on any cha p ter s in the te x t b ook .
She did not b r ing it because she thought it was more im p or t ant to get to know each other .
It mean s she has n ' t even re a ch ed the le g al dr in k ing age yet .
I have a difficult time ma k ing / comp o s ing long sen t ence s and can not keep talk ing about one sp e c if ic to p ic .
She also told me to feel free to as k what ever / anything I want to know .
She let me know her ce ll p h on e number , and I did the same .
We set a future s ch ed ul ed ate and said good - by e to each other .
L a st month , go o g le was at ta c k ed by C h in e se serve r s .
But it appear s that G o o g le has already got ten it ' s re ve ng e against the at ta c k er s .
The a b o ve ar t ic le s are very interest ing but f ri g h ten ing .
I got up at 6 : 3 0 am at the hotel in Y o k o ha m a .
The hotel name was Y o k o ha m a P r in ce H ot el , and the room I stay ed in was very good .
I wish I could stay long er !
The works h op s and one of class es were so b or ing but the other class was re ally n ic e .
The teacher was ent h us i a st ic so I conc ent r at ed on listen ing to her le c ture very much .
My friend who m I me t with last night after a long time brought me two paper b a c k s to day .
The p ow er ful ty p h o on had pass ed by , so the we a ther was good in Y o k o ha m a .
I left there about 5 : 3 0 p m and came back to N i i g at a about 8 : 3 0 p m .
T h ough it was only a two - day tri p , I felt like it was a long business tri p this time .
E s c a p is m ?
I wonder if I could take a s um m er va c ation .
I gue s s even if I take a va c ation , I ' ll have to sp en d much time on home w or k .
To day I saw a mo v i e , B e f or e S un ri se .
L if e is n ' t like that , now a day s I feel that
life has no end of trouble s .
No w I can le ar n English and think about it when ever ^ ^
I ex pe ri ence d the g i g ant ic e ar th qu a ke in no r th - e a st J a p an .
Then all of the things on the desk f e ll down to the floor .
I walk ed back to my house after about 5 0 minute s .
On the way home I saw the people f il led in the street s walk ing .
I am ha p p y all my family me m b er s are s a f e .
[ she s la m m ed down the p h on e when I called to apologize this morning ] ?
To day , I went to the d ent is t for the first time in a while .
I was suppose d to go on M ar ch 1 st , but I c ance led the a p po in t ment .
I pro c r a st in at ed because I have been too bu s y re c ent ly and my te e th did n ' t a ch e any more .
To day , I had free time and f in ally went .
I think my te e th will never a ch e any more , but I have to have my te e th and f il ling s kept c le an .
To day , I con ta c ted my new bo s s .
My new bo s s said , you must le ar n English .
The reason is that my bo s s in ten d s for me to con ta c t to for e i g n comp an ies .
My bo s s said , I want you to go to the P h il i p p in es .
I thought it was a j o ke .
However , it was not .
P er ha p s , I will visit the P h il i p p in es in a f e w month s from now .
That was the first time that I had ever see n the who le town without e le c t ri c ity and go comp le te ly dark .
No e le c t ri c ity mean s that everything includ ing tra f f ic light s , street light s , and st ation s do n ' t work comp le te ly .
Yes ter day , I had a black o ut for three hour s and d ur ing that time , I stay ed home and play ed the a c ous t ic g u it ar because there was nothing to do expect that .
I could n ' t turn on my P C , I c a n ' t c ook anything in my k it ch en which works with e le c t ri c ity and I could n ' t read any b ook s .
No w I ' ve been wonder ing when our life will go back to normal .
It is not a business tri p !
I ' m going to visit S i man e K en this S un day and
I ' m p l an n ing to go to I z um o - T a is y a on S at ur day .
I ' m a little a f f r a id that I c a n ' t get a ti c ke t to see around I z um o - T a is y a ,
because there is a sp e c i al ex h i b i tion this s um m er that is
he l d once every 6 0 year s .
I gue s s there are many to ur is t s .
B e f or e the farewell part y for my friend , we went to S un se t be a ch .
I ' m try ing to a b s or b it as if it ' s like a kind of de st in y for us who come to the U S to study English .
I ' ve already see n off l ot s of friend s .
So tomorrow I will go to L A X to see her off .
A n y way , I ( we ) went to S un se t be a ch .
We s w a m a l ot for a to t al of 2 hour s .
T h an k s to that , my who le body is so re to day .
As you know , there are two way s to study .
We will talk with our friend s , we will want to play outside with our friend s , but there are n ' t any p ar ent s who will dis c i p line us for the se things , there f or e we may play outside and not study .
However , if we study alone , normal ly we study in our home , so there is n ' t any part n er to talk with / to , al th ough we re ally want to play outside , there are n ' t enough friend s to play with , and our p ar ent s would dis c i p line us about this .
Some people say : It ' s he al th i er for the body to either la y or sleep on the gr ound .
However , since I first mo v ed to my new house I have been sleep ing for one week on the gr ound .
F ir st ly my ne c k was almost b ro k en : (
but after two days I got us ed to it . A l s o , I felt more re la x ed .
In addition , I have n ' t found a be d yet .
I re g ul ar ly go j o g g ing 3 or 4 k il ome ter s once a week .
To day , al th ough I did n ' t know what I was think ing , I de c id ed to run to the near est sea that is about 3 0 k il ome ter s and back .
I have become a f an of this sit e .
This is easy to study and I enjoy us ing this .
But I only p r a c t ic e my writing on this sit e .
M an y teachers c or re c t my sen t ence s and tea ch me .
And I can also study when I have small am o un t s of free time .
T h an k s to the own er and every us er of this sit e .
U n like most un ive r s it ies with too many bu il d ing s and too little p l ant s , C ha ng s ha U n ive r s ity look s like more than a ga r d en .
A cross the ga te get ting into the school , you will feel like return ing to nature .
W and er ing on the c amp us , gr e en tree s , co l or ful f l ow er s and clear water catch your eyes , f r a g r ant s m e ll of f l ow er s o c c up ies your no se , and voice s of read ing al o ud and s ing ing of b ir d s c a p ture s your e ar s .
The be st thing is that the ro ad is so c le an that you almost c a n ' t find any r u b b ish , even a piece of was te paper .
F ar away from the no is e of down t ow n , study ing and living in the un ive r s ity is a very co m f or t able ex pe ri ence , and the quiet en v ir on ment also help s us more f o c us on study ing .

My friend B R E A D told me la ng - 8 was f un , so I re g is ter ed an account
I visit ed m y c ous in ' s house last week en d .
H on est ly , I am w or ri ed about their new ly mar ri ed life .
She was poor with house w or k at one time because her mother t ook care of her so much .
I felt sorry , but his dis h / me al was better th an her s .
Some for e i g n er s ten d to think that J a p an e se me n don ` t do house ke e p ing at all and w ome n work for their hu s b and s de v ot ed ly .
Some me n does n ` t do house w or k ti ll now , but most of them help with house h o l d ch or es .
There are a f e w hu s b and s w h o do all a f house ke e ing like a N e w Z e al and er , but more and more me n are begin n ing to be interest ed in their home .
A c t u ally , one of my da d ` s ho b b y is ir on ing shirt s on S un day .
It ` s not work but a h o b b y for him .
That ' s w h y , I want to insist to f or e i g n w ome n . `` D on ` t feel that it is w or st to get mar ri ed w i th J a p an e se guy !
`` And for for e i g n me n , `` D o not expect too much when you get mar ri ed with a J a p an e se woman . ``
if I get a job , I have no pro ble m . .
I ' m re ally w or ri ed about get ting a job . .
I ' m look ing to le ar n to draw .
but school started in J an u ar y .
I just re m a in re g re t ting
but it is too l ate for re g re t .
I ' m T a k um i , from K y ot o , J a p an .
I ' ve never written a di ar y before .
I of ten tra ve l v i a a ir p la ne on business tri p s .
When the a ir p la ne s way s , J a p an e se C A ( f light at ten d ant s ? ) always say , `` We are ex pe ri en c ing t ur b ul ence right now , but it does n ' t po se a pro ble m to our f light . ``
So , it s c ar es me when they say this .
I do n ' t think they should me n tion de ta il s about the f light !
A T y p h o on is co m m ing To J a p an
It is O c t o b er , and it is very co l d .
In the U S A , ty p h o on s have w ome n ' s name s .
In As i a , ty p h o on s have name s of my th ical an im al s .
In J a p an , ty p h o on s are re c or d ed with number s , such as `` ty p h o on # 1 `` , and so on .
A ty p h o on is going through J a p an to night , it b r ing s very r ough we a ther with it .
V er y strong w in d , very he a v y ra in , ty p h o on s some time s cause f l o o d s , & l and s l id es . Some people are k il led .
In the U S A , c y c l on es go through every year . A part of the U S A is serious ly da m age d .
T y p h o on s going through J a p an are not as strong as c y c l on es .
To night , I will stay in my house and w o n ' t go out .
R e c ent ly , I have to study some t est s for my job .
T est s are re la ted to I T s k i ll s , and it ' s certain ly interest ing to so l ve pro ble m s .
Some of t est s are con d u c ted in English , so I return ed here to p r a c t ic e !
There has been some good new s in my family .
F or t un ate ly , he ' s going to be a st ud ent at the un ive r s ity he l o ve s .
M o m got accept ed by the K or e an ( ? ) n ation al open un ive r s ity yesterday .
The ha p p ies t ever .
It will be four , if D ad get s into co ll e g e next year .
That ' s why every K or e an think s they have to go to co ll e g e .
The last 3 days we had very good we a ther , but to day it ' s c l o ud y again . . .
da m n .
O o o and our new c ook has left ; he thought it would be too much work .
I do n ' t understand him ; in time s like this you should be ha p p y to have any work ; well , what do I know ? I ' m just 2 0 year s old .
So o that ' s all for to day I think .
It ' s been about twenty days since the w in n er s of the A c ad e m y A w ar d s were an no un c ed .
A ll the no m in e es were de s er v ing to get the a w ar d s .
S ur p ri s ing ly , she had been no m in at ed many time s d ur ing her long care er .
S pe a k ing of M er y l S t re e p , I found a n ic e v id e o on You T u b e called `` M er y l S t re e p read s The V el ve te en R a b b it . `` When my ch il d re n were small , I read this story for them and I like d it .
I had c aught a call from my friend , who se b ir th day was on that day .
He want ed to be ce le b r at ed his b ir th day by me , so I ce le b r at ed for / with him .
He is un us u al man .
Then , my friend los t his p ur se in the train from K um a m ot o to H a k at a .
There f or e , we went to the con ta c t c ent er in the st ation and the police st ation to as k if the p ur se had been found .
T w o hour s la ter it was found , so we a p p re c i at ed people who help ed us .
Then , I went back to my home t ow n on the 3 0 th of D e ce m b er .
I me t some friend s in re c ent days / l ate ly , and will go to C h i b a tomorrow .
I would like to stay in my home t ow n more , but I ' ll start to work on the 4 th of J an u ar y .
I want to work near my home t ow n some day .
I ' m not good at English , but I want to make friend s in for e i g n co un t ri es .
to day is my favor ite s ing er ' s ten th de b ut an n ive r s ar y .
English class f in ally finish ed to day . . .
I think the one month ter m was very short , but I was very l u c k y to me e t a good teacher .
He is from C h i le but he had live d in A m er ic a since he was you ng .
T h r ough his effort s , I could im p ro ve my English co m m un ic ation s k i ll s a little b it than I did in the past .
F or in st ance , when class started , he always asked us one question , `` What happen ed yesterday ? `` .
When he asked me this question at the first class , I could not answer it well .
O f course I had in ten d ed to answer him but I could not answer at all .
But as the days went by , I gradua l ly was able to a d a p t to his question .
So if I have my opinion s now , I can bra in st ro m idea s and say anything ( O R : tell people / other s anything ) .
A l th ough it is not yet per f e c t I feel my s k i ll s im p ro v ing .
A n y way I feel so s ad with part ing with him . . .
I only have good me m or ies . . .
and I think I will be not able to me e t some on e like him again in this hard world .
It will be my p re c i ous me m or ies . . , so I ho pe to hold on to them unti l I di e . . .
a d i o s . . .
My first time us ing S k y pe !
I talk with my friend s from high school day s on S k y pe ! !
This was my first time us ing it . 8 )
It ' s a re v o l u tion ar y in ve n tion .
I think I ' ll be very n er v ous the first time : 3
In my opinion , a good an im ation has three e le ment s :
A n ic e s c ri p t : F ir st , you must gra b people ' s f o c us . What you want to say and the con t ent de ter m in e whether people want to keep watch ing it .
S u it able back g r ound m us ic : This is im p or t ant , and I think good m us ic is the spirit of the mo v i e .
It can all ow people to more easily put themselves into the dr a m a .
O f course , the character de s i g n s and their a ction s are im p or t ant . . ha ha a like this o c t op us . . it ' s very c ut e even though it does n ' t have any line s .
B y the way . . . how many feet does an o c t op us have ?
This is my first e m a il , I want to live in the U S A .
I have been study ing English for many year s , but I ' m not that good yet .

Some time s I felt they were sen s it ive about some po l it ical to p ic s , but for of many reason , they felt ha p p y too .
O ur high school teachers care d for them , and the e th n ic H an class m ate s were glad to help them to study many sub j e c t s too ` ` `
The dinner was de l ic i ous , and we dr an k a b it of be er and play ed j o ke s on each other . It was a wonder ful time . I for g ot many an no y ing things te m p or ar i ly . What a ha p p y night in B e i j ing ! ~ ~ life is co o l ~ ~

There f or e , I de c id ed to sen d him another e m a il .
My e ng l ish teacher re c o m m en d ed that I get an English D i ction ar y .
It ' s called an `` e ng l ish - e ng l ish di ction ar y `` in J a p an .
The mean ing s of English w or d s are explain ed in English .
My teacher said `` when you study e ng l ish w or d s , think of e ng l ish w or d s in your head .

Then I end in t ro d u c ing myself .
I than k you who read this , I ho pe you ' ll become my friend ^ ^
It ' s re ally ra re to be able to take a va c ation for such a long time in J a p an .
And I have de c id ed to tra ve l a cross C ro at i a and S l o ve n i a for 1 2 day s ! !
I have not de c id ed anything yet ex c ept for my f light s .

In A p ri l , I also led the di v is ion to man age a ne t w or k di v is ion .
H ence , I will go to a U K un ive r s ity course in ent re p re ne ur s h i p or business .
What do I feel ?
What did I le ar n ?
And the other thing that I must le ar n is not be afraid when I speak in front of people .
A l th ough I feel a b it bad , and dis a p po in ted of myself because I ' ve de c id ed to be more respon s i ble with my home w or k and I did n ' t do it .
In both present ation s , I did n ' t make an effort to get a good not e and I know that I could have done it better but I did n ' t , but also , I did n ' t receiv e the s up p or t of my tea m .
If I was la z y , they were la z i er than me .
That ' s why I ' ve le ar n ed that I ' ve got to work hard er , if my tea m do n ' t do anything , I ' ve got to do it because the not e is im p or t ant , and I gue s s that I have to do it by myself .
On the other hand , I felt very am a z ed about some class m ate s . They did a wonder ful job and I felt en v i ous of them because I ' d l o ve to do it in the same way or better .
But I pro m is e that the next time I ' ll make an effort and I w o n ' t tru st in my tea m m ate s .
