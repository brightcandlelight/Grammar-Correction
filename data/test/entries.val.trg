And he took in my favorite subjects like soccer .
Actually , he was the one who let me know about Lang - 8 . .
His Kanji ability is much better than mine .
We 've known each other for only half a year , but his lessons were a lot of fun .
I heard a sentence last night when I was watching TV .
When you go downhill , you have to stick out your chest or you will fall down .
When you go uphill , you have to bend your back .
It is like when you are confronted with frustration and you have to keep your confidence .
When everything is going smoothly , you have to be more modest .
When I was at school , we painted a lot of wooden handywork , like small plates and cases .
Making souvenirs is a hard but interesting work .
iFinally my mother took me to the customs window , and gave a passport to the man . . .
There are two balls : one with a cat inside , the other with dog .
You know , you can ( win ? ) them at a slot machine .
The third memory is the house where we lived .
It was situated near Helsinki , a big and light house with e a small lake behind it . It was winter , so it was frozen .
I do n't know why .
I liked Finland in the Winter .
And I hope I 'll like Finland in the Summer .
Just start improvising ! `` To tell the truth , I myself did n't expect
If only I had dense black curtains .
A couple of weeks ago , I heard a new Whitney Houston tune / song on my car radio .
I had been wondering what she was / has been doing .
It said that it was disappointing .
Old and not beautiful . . . . . ( wwwww )
I know about her tumultuous marriage with Bobby Brown and an arduous battle with her drug addiction .
she still has n't recovered from them ?
More disappointing to me is she said the reason for her bad voice that day ? was because she talked with Oprah Winfrey too much on her show .
That might be one of the reasons , however , to me it just sounds like an excuse .
I would say after 10 years of waiting , it has not failed its title , at least not from my first impression .
Anyway , I think I 'll spend quite some time playing it in the next few weeks .
OK , that 's all for my first entry .
Before , I went to the library .
On the way I got a headache .
So , I think if we have to go somewhere on foot , we must put on our hat .
If we did n't do that and walked for long time , we would will collapse or die .
If my sentences are n't practical , please correct them .
This morning I found out that one of my favourite bands released a new album .
I already forgot about Rise Against and it is a great surprise for me , because I have n't listened to them for 2 years .
I hope this band did n't become worse , like many others big ones did , and I 'll enjoy listening to it .
Well , I just have to get it and check it out .
It 's because my mum is probably the best cook I have ever met in my life .
Cooking is not her profession ; but rather , she is a housewife .
I have eaten at hotels and have had expensive meals but they are nothing like what she cooks .
I would rather be working outside than be a housewife .
I think it 's been about one and half years now .
I should have exploded the whole building so I can destroy ~ them ! ! !
I had to write about counseling .
This is my first time writing a diary on the internet .
I hope someone will see my diary and correct it .
I watched a DVD of `` Grey 's anatomy `` today .
Actually I watch it a lot these days .
So there is a lot to see .
I do n't know all the medical words in English .
But I can study English with it .
And I think it 's fun , right ? ( YEAH ! )
I 'm eating a banana every day for my health .
Bananas gives me energy .
I have to make a newspaper in English as my summer vacation homework and I decided to introduce about my dog in the newspaper .
I will introduce my dog , Tiara .
She is a cheerful and plump pretty dog , perhaps she is the cutest dog in the world .
She 's an 8 year old golden retriever
Her fur is a beautiful amber colour and is soft .
She is a little stupid , but has perceptive insights about food because she is always famished ^ ^ She loves food !
When she is basking she looks very content .
However , I hoped it would rain today because it is too hot .
I saw a news article on Yahoo yesterday .
It reported that Chien - Ming Wang cut his hair and has a new hair style .
Here is the link :
It talked about there being a big difference about different values of a handsome man between Western countries and Eastern countries .
It mentioned many examples of Japanese men , Korean men , and Hong Kong men .
They paid much attention to their faces and spent lots of money to shop .
But in Western countries , the standard of a handsome man depends not on their faces , but on their masculine symbols , like muscle and behavior .
I started to notice the ways of foreign clothing and hair styles these past days by watching TV programs , such as Friends , Scrubs , etc .
If they had a long hair , it would be really long and thick .
By contrast , men in eastern countries dress up more .
Apart from a shirt and jeans , we usually wear an accessory .
As to hair , men usually have medium hair , neither very short or long .
If we want to cut our hair short , we must leave some hair on the back of neck in order to avoid looking like a nerd .
It almost cost me a whole morning .
I have to watch the NBA 's final game 3 .
I like you give me any comments and opinions too .
I would really like to discuss .
My son has diarrhea
When I came back home from work today , my son had diarrhea .
It was like water and his bottom was red .
We were planning to go to my hometown tomorrow .
We were all ready to go .
But we had to cancel the trip .
But there 's no way we can go .
I am listening to music on the commuter train .
Today , I listen the music , it feels like I am in a cafe .
I like the warm season .
So , I like spring .
Spring is a very exciting season .
In Japan , the new school and work year starts in spring .
I hope to become qualified in English .
I hope to get a new promotion .
Everyday , there are new things to try .
. . . No , very frequently .
Starting today , I 'm going to try write a diary everyday ! !
Today has nothing specal to write ! !
It 's a kind of Tai - wan style massage .
I loved the massage shop where I went because the staff of the shop explained what is wrong in my body .
After that , I went to a fitness club which has bedrock bathing .
I felt relaxed to take a bedrock bath ^ ^
I went to Sendai as a business trip today .
The special product of Sendai is a cow 's tongue .
I bought it and ate it at home .
I want to eat this cow 's tongue again .
My daughter / She was woken up by my wife .
The wife was woken up by my stertor / snoring .
Where to hold it and when we should leave has not been decided yet !
So , even now I feel nervous , wondering if it 's really going to be held .
And I want to live my life at my own pace .
Because when I 've finished my classes , homework or jobs etc . . .
It 's nearly 10 pm when I get back home .
It 's nearly 12 pm .
I 've been suffering many unhappy things these days .
Maybe things are n't so bad own their own , but I really ca n't handle them when they occur together . . . .
I do n't know how to master this language . . .
Though I spend most of my time and energy in learning English , it 's become apparent that I 've hardly made any improvement .
I do n't know why it 's so hard for me to learn English ! ! !
our teacher said something to me that made my heart break . .
I had never known my English was poor until the teacher told me that my English sounded illogical . . . .
Summer Holiday
I had a long breaktime .
I should study again .
I got up at 6 : 30am in Japan .
Hello ! Nice to meet you ! My name is Ailsa .
I hope to make many friends on lang - 8 .
Thank you everyone !
Elections will be held on August 30th .
The Mayer is supporting Hamada for the minister of defense .
Hamada belong 's to the Liberal Democratic Party .
This time they may lose administration .
The Democratic Party has more supporters than they do .
The Mayer is busy with the election campaign as well as his own work .
I 'm going to helping him with his work as his secretary .
I went to a Kanazawa University festival with my American friend .
I made a good friend with a Vietnamese .
We enjoyed it very much .
And we had dinner with my other friends .
. Today was an amazing day .
It is made of sponge : ) It is cute .
I received an acceptance letter and scholarship from the Berklee College of Music .
I 'll enter / go to Berklee in the fall semester this year .
However I have two worries .
One of them is that my English is still very clumsy .
Another is the high - priced tuition fees .
Anyway , I 'm studying English at the TOEFL Institute these days .
Berklee do n't requires a TOEFL score .
I have a lot of assignments everyday .
It 's very difficult to do all of them , but I always try to make my best effort .
I 'm learning English , but it 's really difficult for me !
Several days ago , I had an irregular heartbeat for the first time in my life !
It was like this ; I suddenly started to feel some sort of of discomfort around my heart .
I was very scared because I had been very healthy so far .
I 'm still in my 20 's .
Do I have to live with it for the rest of my life ? ``
The doctor told me that I did occasionally have an irregular pulse but it was not a fatal one .
He added that it could get worse due to stress and fatigue , and he just advised me to take as much rest as needed .
I was relieved to hear the doctor 's diagnosis , but I 'm still worried .
I think that may be a common question for those students who want to pursue higher education .
What Chinese universities offer their students is mostly coursework based curriculum .
I 've summed up some points which I think are important and useful .
You can count on Google as your best friend , adviser and an almost infinite resource of academic papers .
Many of them you can download as a pdf copy , or if you ca n't download a paper from the links scholar . google . com offers you , go directly to the author 's website , many authors enjoy their paper to be seen and cited by readers .
A good review is the best starting point .
And then you can trace the author , or the paper cited , to do a more in depth research into your area of interest .
The correct balance of width and depth of your reading is essential .
Both ways have their merits and disadvantages .
Innovative and original ideas are good , but if you can not find them , you should know that most of research work is just refinement of other 's work .
I 'll spend the next few weeks / the coming weeks on board the `` Justo Sierra `` vessel carrying out some geophysical research and learning .
The bad thing is , I have n't learned the vessel 's parts in English yet .
The thing that I want to do in January 2009 is to put in more effort in studying English and keep on writing sentences in English everyday here in Lang - 8 !
However there were not so many people there , so we did n't need to wait our turn outside .
I think that Manga is the greatest form of entertainment in Japanese culture .
My favorite writers are Naoki Urasawa ( The Monster , 20th Century Boy , etc . ) and Hiroya Oku ( Gantz ) .
By the way , I found some web sites with a huge amount of Manga translated into English .
( I think they are no doubt illegal . )
It 's a new experience and very educational for learning English .
But I think that there are a lot of difficult expressions in English Manga .
Diagnosed with being easily impressed .
I realized that I 'm the kind of person who is easily impressed .
I 'm moved by very simple things that other people might not even have a second look at .
For instance , I started watching some Indian movies about a month ago .
When I had the time , though , I bought about six Indian movies to watch .
The first movie I watched made me cry for two hours like a five - year - old who lost her doll .
Actually all Indian movies have the same basic idea .
However , I continued crying during the rest of the five films and each one of them impressed me even more .
Indian movies are like clay that can be molded into many different shapes while still remaining clay .
This concept might be a bit ambiguous for those who have n't been in such a situation .
I took some medicine , so I feel better for now .
`` 450 times ``
This is my 450th diary .
I started keeping a diary around 2008 .
Thanks to the people all over the world , I 'm having a fun and solid time .
Changing the subject , but I got a call from my friend yesterday .
I was somewhat puzzled what to say .
Hello ! My name is Ken .
I just started studying English .
However , it is terribly difficult .
The novel is about an important Roman politican called / named Gaius Marius .
He is the main character , although others like Cornelius Silla , Metelus , and Caesar 's grandfather also appear .
Marius did n't come from an important family , but he became a consul because he was a clever and popular general in the Roman army .
So , after he was made consul by the Romans , he went to Africa , where he fought against Yugurta , who was king of Numidia .
Marius won the war in two years , and when he went back to Rome he was made consul again for five years .
Marius had to fight other tribes in the north of Italy , until 100 B .
He had to step down from power because he got sick .
I love studying .
By the way , do you like to study ?
I 've just received an international call on my cellphone .
I was wondering if it was from one of my friends .
But it was from Korea 's quarantine depot ,
We do n't have these symptoms right now .
If it helps , this picture is the information they gave us at Japan 's quarantine depot when we returned to Japan .
is anyone free ?
lets hang out in tokyo ~ haha ~ xD
im free until next month .
cuz I don have a school until then ! !
I do n't like it .
Although most people think about what happiness is like , most people never doubt that there is happiness somewhere in a human 's life .
A famous man , I heard , said in the past that the worst thing for you is to be born in the world .
This is just my nickname .
I studied at a university in Tokyo .
I received a bachelor 's degree in applied physics and electronics .
I changed jobs a few times but always kept the same type of job as an engineer .
I currently work for an electronics maker in Japan as an engineer .
My parents , brother , and sister live in Tokyo .
Fukuoka is located the northern part of Kyushu ,
which is a part of the Japanese Archipelago .
Compared with Tokyo , Fukuoka is a compact but very comfortable city .
Commodity prices here are lower than those in Tokyo , and Fukuoka Airport is very near central Fukuoka .
Narita Airport is far from central Tokyo .
Moreover , Tokyo is a very crowded city .
One thing I do not like about living here is that I 'm separated from my family .
It costs a lot of money to go see my parents from here .
An English lesson for Halloween
I 'm an elementary school teacher , as you might know .
In Japan , starting next year we will officially have to teach English to 5th and 6th graders .
I have already made some English classes for the children .
The topic of the lesson was Halloween .
We provided activities to get the students not only to keep enjoying the lesson , but also to keep some vocabulary in mind before they learn it .
One of them is `` Halloween Trivia and Bingo `` .
The students need to answer questions about Halloween that I 've prepared by playing Bingo .
The more answers they get correct , the more Bingo they can play .
After the class , I asked the students to fill out a questionnaire .
I was very glad to find [ that ] they liked the lesson .
One of my ultimate goals as an English teacher is that all students look at the world broadly .
I 'm sure you 'll have plenty of opportunities not only to communicate with people from other countries , but also to learn about several cultural differences through the lesson .
I believe this will lead them to accepting more challenges .
That 's why I 'm very excited to teach students English ! !
It is It 's been cloudy or and rainy recently .
Although my school was no lecture does n't have a lecture , I got up early in the morning today .
It cost six dollars to washing for the laundry and cost six dollars to for the dryer .
When I washing ended , it was evening . Laundry ended till evening .
I went to the cake shop in the city that my friend introduced to has been telling me and it has a as nice taste and famous .
The shop of inner decorating decors was green .
After I came went back home , I cooked dinner , and the food for dinner was were prawns & avocado salad , roast chicken and OTAMA SAN GOHAN .
First , I cut the lettuce , cut coarsely a the tomato coarsely and then stair - fly fry some prawns .
The OTAMA SAN GOHAN is Japaneseonly traditional food .
It only sprinkles the raw egg and a pinch dash of the soy source on warm rice .
They were easy to cooking but they tasted nice ! !
After that I watched two movies , animation of genius boy and 007 , on TV for approximately four hours .
I appreciate you teaching English to my daughter .
I was looking for an English class around here .
We thought about just taking a trial lesson , but she told me that she wanted to go to the lesson again .
I am very surprised about her progress .
Now she is very interested in speaking English , writing the alphabet ( words ) and singing WHAT ' S YOUR NAME ?
We owe her progress to you
It will be a base when she goes to a new school .
If I did n't need to take care of my kids , I would want to take your lessons !
It is very easy to come with kids because it is clean , safe , just a 1 - hour time difference and close to the Haneda airport .
After , university classes , I went directly back home , prepared packages and searched what time I should leave home and which trains I should take .
And if the team wins 8 games , the team will get first position .
But / However the remainder of its games is 9 games .
Therefore it is difficult for it to get first position .
The starting pitcher was not good , therefore the opposition got 3 points easily .
We cheered very hard , but the miracle never happened .
Those are such things as playing sports , reading books , listening to music , taking walks .
My favorite hobby is talking with my friends , because I think it is the best time to be with my friends .
I gained about 10 kilograms after I quit my clubs in high school .
That 's why I have to lose some weight ! ! !
So , I always jog and exercise . (
I wanna have a six - pack ! ! haha
This weekend , there are three holidays in Japan .
They are on Saturday , Sunday and Monday .
Monday is EquinoxDay .
It will gradually become warm .
Japanese are waiting for cherry blossoms in this season .
Yesterday was the same .
But Next week I will go on business trips .
Tomorrow I do n't have much work .
I will go to the library and to the cafe to study electronics after that .
My friend starred in the play .
She and I became friends when we were junior high school students .
Our friendships has lasted for more than 10 years .
I saw her act for the first time today .
Today is a Japanese National holiday .
So I took a three - day weekend .
Since it was rainy yesterday and today , My family and I could n't enjoy it .
Children were playing games for a very longtime .
And realized how languages can help you know more people .
Reading English make me feel very happy .
I was impressed with my life there very much .
I only told them in English
that it would be good if I could speak
It might be boring .
and remembering Kanji that I like ^ _ ^
Japanese food is available at every corner in Thailand .
I think / believe birds of a feather flock together .
The other day , I met one of my classmate from high school at a station , for the first time in fifteen years .
I 'm an English teacher .
On the other hand , she teaches correct walking and posture .
We made small talk / had a short conversation there and left .
When I started to walk , I had an urge of wanting to talk with her more !
So I called out to her and stopped her .
We exchanged our contact info and decided to meet again very soon .
We met once more two weeks ago , I felt strange / nostalgic then because we had n't met each other for many years , but still we had many things ( that we wanted ) to tell each other .
Plenty of things to talk about , but there was n't sufficient time .
We should n't sort people into levels / types / categories and I believe we are ( all ) living on the same level ( same category , same world ) .
I do n't like watching a screen when it 's too close so I killed time reading something .
Today , I read `` The Catcher in the Rye `` as a summer homework assignment .
To tell the truth , I could not understand why this book is thought of as a masterpiece .
Because I did n't feel bored when I was reading it , but I was not very excited or moved .
If you had read the book , please tell me which part you think is interesting .
21 . 12 . 2012 * * * I 'm a university student .
Hi , I 've started Lang - 8 .
I want to learn English and find friends here .
Can we become friends ?
I lived in London from 2005 to 2008 ,
But I ca n't speak English . . . ( ; _ ; )
So please teach me English ! !
I graduate from university in 2012 .
so I want to exchange information about my job around the world .
I called for a refund for the Park Yong - ha concert tickets .
I heard that they send money by registered mail by August 13th .
Culture of shame
Foreign media admires how Japanese people are behaving calmly , organised and in a supporting manner .
But it 's common for us Japanese .
We think that making trouble for others is a very bad and shameful thing .
Every parent wants their children not to trouble others .
In the past , Japanese grew rice which was needed to help others in the community .
It would be great if you correct my mistakes .
Thanks a . lot .
I did n't know why I lied , but at that time I blanked out .
It was about a job I sought from the news paper .
Although I know a private school student like me in Singapore is stictly prohibit to go to have a job .
I am still going to the place to try my luck .
When my auntie asked me what kind of pass I held .
But for me I am more focused on learning the experience through working and communicating with others .
By the way , the job is really a short - term job ( seller ) , which only lasts for two weeks .
Today I saw a movie called Twilight .
But some of them made me feel disgusted .
Edward is cute , he cared about Bella .
And Bella is a strong girl .
Yesterday , Japan 's national soccer team played against Australia .
It was the final match of the Asian Cup 2011 .
Five days ago , Japan played 120 minutes , including extra time , against South Korea , furthermore , the average height of the Australian team is taller than Japan .
So I thought most of the Japanese members would be tired and the game would be very hard for them .
The game went into extra time twice in a row in the semi - final game for Japan .
However , at 110 minutes , Lee , who came off the bench , got the goal !
I 'm very glad that Japan won !
Do you like singing ?
I like to sing very much .
Today , I went to the karaoke box with my son and neighbors .
I sang so many songs and relieved my stress .
My favorite karaoke songs are by Seiko Matsuda .
Her songs are easy to sing to , known by many people , and they also have good rhythms .
I had a relaxing time .
Today I might fall asleep soon .
Long ago , my father got a guitar .
h He 's still the owner .
I do n't know but I often use it more than him .
I 'll do my best !
It is the season of cherry trees in Japan right now .
Here are some reason why we love them .
The time from bloom to falling is very early .
It is like a human life . ( tatemae ! )
It is a lot of fun to drink while seeing them .
I had a headache , was tired , and had no appetite .
I slept all day until I had to work .
The day before yesterday , I hung around with one of my Chinese friends .
We went to JINMAO OBSERVATORY88 .
It was a rather high building .
Do you know me ?
I am a hero .
But I am also a robot who is handled by a remote control .
Fortunately , I am a hero of justice .
So I am called , `` The Hero of Justice . ``
My name is `` Tetuzin 28 go `` , which means `` iron man No . 28 `` .
If the remote control is taken by an evil person ,
I am truly a hero of justice though .
Where am I ?
Hint : In Japan .
Okinawa is in the southernmost part of Japan so it was hot there .
We enjoyed snorkeling !
We went to the beach which is an desert island near Naha .
I felt like I was in dream because the sea was so beautiful and there was a lot of fish .
And we went to Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum .
I think that the war should never of happened .
Today was my chinese friend 's birthday .
She is a 26 year - old woman who works for a travel agency .
In addition , she is pursuing a modeling career in Japan .
We met at a night club in Tokyo .
Our dreams are different , but I think we are similar in that we both want to pursue our own dreams .
I wonder what I should give her as a present , so could you give me some advice ?
Foreign baby
I can meet foreigners if I go to the city area in Tokyo , but I wo n't be able to meet a foreign baby .
It 's only adult or children that I meet .
I like babies so I 'm always looking forward to meet a foreign baby
He has been living in Japan for 10 years and he likes to talk with Japanese people .
I think our language skills were even .
He wants his baby to speak Japanese so he 's learning Japanese everyday .
Recently , I 'm fascinated with a TV series named `` How I met your mother . `` ( Though I do n't watch it on TV but the Internet because is has n't been introduced into Taiwan .
He always makes his own theory about life !
Today , since people turn out to be more and more rational and have higher demands about the opposite sex , along with an open mind about dating which has nurtured tons of different reality dating shows .
This show features `` Parents dating Guys `` .
The process is like this , the girl 's parents will meet the guys first , then they will make the decision for their own daughters who , by the way , is not even on the scene about whether they should give this guy a chance to go out for a date with their daughters or not .
I do n't understand why so many people are into this stuff , I decided to arrange some nice dates for my friends by following my own style .
A date that can exude both parties ' warmth and charisma .
Sounds a little bit tricky ?
Without audiences , love judges , parents , just a friendly and private atmosphere , which allows them to be themselves and enjoy the moment .
Last night was the second date ( that ) I arranged for my friend and hopefully they can work things out !
playing the two roles
I 'm a employee on a weekday and a student at graduate school for the three days in a week .
I enrolled the school in April .
Hard work is required sometimes , but obtaining a new knowledge is nice .
I am challenging a task that I have not ever done in the business .
This is also very valuable to me .
Without fail when there 's great need , great hearts and minds rise up to meet the challenge .
In two months , my professor will take some students to Ohio university in America for a month .
But whomever wants to go there , must pass the exam and interview .
Going abroad is my dream , so I really cherish this opportunity .
It is a good chance to strengthen my knowledge , broaden my horizon , enjoy foreign customs , and also realize my dream .
Without any means to improve my poor English I can try speaking more , listening more , reading more , and so on .
In my opinion , it is a difficult process to overcome myself , but I must insist on doing my best , no matter how difficult it is .
Once you make up your mind , persevere in doing it .
I was suprised when I found it . I have been studying English for 2 years because I want to make a lot of friends all over the world .
Yesterday , Kitajima Kousuke who is a breast stroke swimmer , got the gold medal .
He is smaller than most people but he did it .
I was very impressed .
They are illuminated during the night .
The top of the mountain was very cold , even though I was wearing snowboard gear .
I hope I do n't catch a cold . : )
Wishing You Happiness In Paradise
I just listened to his bandBoyzone 's brilliant song `` No Matter What `` on the way back home .
Stephen was cute and brave but now he is gone .
When I was in junior high school everything seemed boring and meaningless , and I also did poorly in my studies .
One day , I failed anexam .
At that time I had no place to go ; my parents hatedwhen I underachieved but suddenly a fair - sounding voice floated to my ear . ' I ca n't deny what I believe , I ca n't be what I 'm not . ' I was astonished by the voice and lyrics which cheered me up .
Your lovely face looked like a ray of hope .
I wish you happiness in paradise .
With knowing comes caring , and with caring there is hope that we could make way for a healthy environment that sustains us .
[ Independent paragraph ] Oil has been flooding the gulf of Mexico for three months .
[ Independent paragraph ] There has been only 15 days without war since the beginning of humanity , which means an uncountable number of people have been killed and been killing at the same time .
[ Independent paragraph ] On the other side of the globe , a great number of people live on less than a dollar .
Clearly , the world is lopsided .
Watching CNN and reading The New York Times , I am suddenly wondering how many of us believe we know what 's going on outside our own little world .
I 'm building computer program algorithms even when I am dreaming at night , because I 've been doing computer programs all day long .
It was n't the correct algorithm , I am trying to make a block puzzle .
The program will be piling blocks up or sorting them or doing something else .
For 10 months , I studied Java and Japanese .
It was particularly difficult to study Japanese .
Actually / Honestly , I wondered `` can I do this ? ``
Sometimes , I felt frustrated and despaired .
Next Wednesday , the economics seminar softball match will take place .
However , the experience of volleyball does not transfer well in softball because the form is different
Anyway , I 'm really looking forward to play the game ! !
I must to read literature , which is written in English .
So , I am starting to learn English for the first time in a decade .
I am an auditor of a construction company .
Today the Japanese construction industry faces a serious crisis .
When someone asks me , `` What 's your favorite thing ? ``
I 'll respond , `` My hobby is reading books , ``
In fact , most people , when asked about their hobby ,
they would n't usually answer that they `` love to read books `` .
and magazines ,
thanks for reading and fixing my wrong sentences , ,
Today was a busy day .
I have been working non - stop .
I have to work from 9 : 00a . m . to 10 : 00 p . m .
You get to experience a lot of things , like how to use different kinds of pens , and meet a lot of people , even if they are not always very kind . *
Our break time is too short .
Oh , how wonderful the college life is !

Additionally , the first team gets to travel to New York !
We won the last test , and each of the members of our team got a mobile phone .
As I had just bought a Motorola Milestone ( the european version of Droid ) , I gave it to my father , who 's actually very happy with it , since it 's a cute small Nokia with wifi .
We 're going first next time , but since they try to give one prize to a different team each time , we expect the jury to make the ones who are going third win this time .
But we still hope we win in the end and visit USA ! !

Yesterday I saw the weather forecast
Yesterday I saw the weather forecast which informed that today it will rain all day long .
I opened window but it was not raining .
It was a warm fine day .
During the day I waited for the rain as I looked up at the sky and I was thinking what the problem with weather forecast organization .

There were 90 % which expected the rain today but they were wrong .

We need to book a car and my friend kaan a Turkey guy will help us to move the baggage .
We should make a note of what we need .
My Japanese friend sent me some tea implements for Japanese tea ceremony last month .
I attended Japanese tea ceremony lessons one day a week for three years , before I came here to Japan .
I liked to learn how to serve green tea . I made some friends at the lesson .
And the teacher was so great to us .
I was enjoying the commute to this class .
Now I want to drink this green tea sometimes .
So today I made green tea by simple process .
After I made it , I drank the green tea .
How bitter !
It was so bitter .
Why do n't I remember this taste ?
But I 'll make the green tea again .
I 'm going to send a message to my friend . . .

Ca n't I say `` fried potatoes `` ? You can .
In the grammar exercises , which I did for hours ( ? ) I could n't correct any sentences ( ? ) .
Because it is very important ; I 'll never get a good job without it , and I 'll never understand half of the beautiful sites in the Internet !
And I like to draw in Photoshop and Illustrator , and many other things !
Somebody , who is learning Russian , and all who want to talk with a Russian girl - lets talk by skype !
Today all of my classmates and I went to the Huang River Park .
The Huang river is the second longest river of China .
As its name implies , the water is very yellow carrying lots soil .
I regretted wearing new clothes , when I came back they were full of dust .
The river is very long . I ca n't see the end , and the water is peaceful .

When he gets silence , it is a dangerous sign to me .
I put my fingers into his little mouth , and pull it out .
I tried to keep an eye on him while doing house work ,
Everyday he is growing little by little , step by step ,
and everyday I am learning how to deal with his can - do things .
Spring Vacation is Almost Here !
It 's been a long time since I wrote a diary entry .
My university classes started on January 8th , but they will be over shortly .
Time flies !
When spring vacation comes , I will have to study English harder , and I 'd like to write a diary entry everyday .
I would be so happy if you would comment on my diary .
But I slept in late this morning !
I 'm absolutely getting up early ! !
Actually , there are not only three solutions in the article , but I just picked out three solutions .
This will result in a rapidly aging society with fewer children .
I 'm looking forward to seeing them !
My life is changing in NY .
For example , today I ordered some clothes online ( you do n't say `` internet shop `` ) .
I felt happy !
When I used to live in Seoul I used to shop online .
There are many products that are cheaper online than in retail stores .
After I left Seoul , I stopped shopping online .
I could n't believe the charging method .
It was much easier than the Korean method .
I just need credit card numbers , that 's it !
I was worried that somebody would take my credit card number .
Finally , I found the official website . ( For what ? )
It made me feel more comfortable and safe to buy there .
There is no A & F store in Korea , so people sell this brand .
And is very expensive ! !
Because of this experience , I could n't stop shopping on A & F website .
I ordered some clothes and they are going to shipped on FEB .
I 'm a little disappointed with the shipping speed but it does n't matter because I 'm really satisfied with the prices and the designs .
I hope it arrives soon !
My very first diary entry on Lang - 8
On the first day of 2010 , like every other year , I made a new years resolution .
Bur this year is a little bit different than the previous years .
I am planning to move to a foreign company , which means my ability to speak and write English should improve .
So I decided to write an English diary as a way to improve my english .
And luckily , I found THIS SITE ! !
I believe that writing an English diary will really help to improve my English skills .
Typhoon is coming
A big strong typhoon is headed towards the middle area of Japan .
Right now its raining heavily and a strong wind is blowing here , so I closed all shutters to protect the windows and reduce the noise .
I 'm a little worried about whether I ' lll be able to commute to my office tomorrow morning or not .
Moreover , I should attend her feelings more once more .
The situation made me realize the important things .
First experience
My eleven month old son stood by himself for the first time today !
However , he started to cry hard afterward .
He must have been scared that he was standing without any help .
My English is very bad .
I do n't know any grammar and I 'm afraid to speak English .
In fact , I want to say so many things , but writing in English is very tiring .
Hello ! I 'm sorry to write my diary late ; (
Today , I slept for only two hours .
So I felt sleepy all day .
Why I stayed up late , because I watched ladies soccer game ! The game was between Japan called `` Nadeshiko Japan `` and America .
The first half of the game was a draw and the second half of the game was a draw .
The overtime game was a draw too ! I was very strained by PK ! I 'm afraid of watching PK .
Finally , Japan won the game , so `` Nadeshiko Japan `` is top team in the world ! ! I was excited , so I could n't sleep ; ) But I do n't regret watching soccer .
I want to play some sports ! Thank you very much : )
I decided that I will write a diary everyday at lang - 8 about dairy thing to learn English .
Today , I took a walk around my house by bicycle .
I visited a Freemarket which was held at park .
The sounds of ( people 's ) footsteps / Footsteps
Yes , I am specifically referring to my boss .
I thank my sharp ears for ( the sake of ) my survival until now .
So many MMA fighters think they want to be stronger than they are .
This is the most important thing to them but , my opinion is different .
Even if they are strong , they do n't win sometimes .
MMA is a sport that should n't be though of as a regular sport .
There are a fighters who do n't think MMA is a sport and when they lose fights , they seem like they want to kill their opponent . It goes to show a strong person can lose to a weak person .
I want to say , there is no future in MMA for just the strong .
Fedor , who is Russian , is not very strong .
Yet he is named the one of the best fighters in the world .
3 : 25 a . m . JST
It is 3 : 25 a . m . Japan Standard Time ( JST ) .
Today , I went to university .
In English class there was a test : (
I wanted to more study .
In fact , this is n't the time I 'm supposed to write in my diary on Lang - 8 .
But , I 'm going to do it now , because my laptop is supposed to get repaired , and in a couple of hours , the mechanic is going to be here to pick it up .
Well , the reason why I call the repairman is because it has been making loud noises and the screen often makes waves .
It has been about eight months since I purchased it , so any service is free .
now here he 's is .
Okay right now I want to know what the best way is to learn English accents ?
Since I 'm weak in understanding the accents of a language .
I hope someone here can give me some tips or steps that I should take in order to improve my communication skills
One of my friends , Yoshimi , introduced me to this website .
It 's good to exchange culture and language that we are trying to learn .
I will try to write everyday , I am planning to write to a bussiness person soon , so I really need your help .
It ca n't be said in simple words .
I dreamed about her the night before yesterday .
I dreamed that I found her just sitting by my side when I awoke .
Today , I met an old friend .
I drank beer with her .
I asked her if she had a boyfriend .
She answered , `` Yes , I have a boyfriend . ``
I was a little disappointed .
Someday , I will find a girlfriend .
My chance will surely come .
It features the heavy use of melted cheese , beans , chili and tortillas .
The only problem is that it is very heavy food .
When I have Tex - Mex at lunch , I ca n't eat anything at night . . . .
I am new to lang - 8 .
Everyday , I work very hard to learn it .
But recently , I have wanted to speak English .
If I can speak English fluently someday , I want to go abroad .
And I want to see the wonderful architecture of foreign countries .
That 's why , I started learning English .
I woke up earlier than normal today .
Because I had a headache and a heavy stomach .
I thought that was why I felt bad in the bed .
I had a dinner at 11pm yesterday and slept as soon as possible .
I did n't feel that way before , yet I did the same things .
I am disappointed that I 'm still not young !
We have a three day holiday , so I wlll spend these days playing .
Yesterday I got up late as usual , and then had lunch , went to the supermaket with my good friend , and bought something for my family .
Yesterday was a busy day , but I was very happy .
I felt the time passed faster than usual .
I am older than before .
I have n't written here for a long time because I found a job .
It was very difficult work because we have to work overtime .
We have many foreigners as our clients and I really could try my strength in English ) It ` s so interesting to talk with the British , Germans , Italians , Danes , Finns , Croats . . .
One Dutchman always ask us `` How are you ? `` , nobody understood him , except me and I could talk with him for a long time .
It was a difficult , but very interesting time )
After my hard - days I am going to go to Minsk , Belarus
Asashoryu is a sumo champion .
Sumo is one of the traditional Japanese sports .
He has recently been accused of punching a man while drunk .
A sumo champion , called a yokozuna , is required to be strong not only physically , but also spiritually .
He is one of the strongest sumo wrestlers in sumo history .
He is very famous , as even I know who he is .
A Backpacker
During the last summer vacation , I traveled around Southeast Asia ; Malaysia ( Malacca and Kuala Lumpur ) , Cambodia ( Siem Reap ) , and Myanmar ( Bagan ) .
I met a Japanese backpacker when I was in KL .
We became fast friends .
He is an experienced backpacker .
He said he traveled around the world .
I like his travel stories especially in Thailand and India .
It was really fun .
Kinabalu in Sabah ( located in Borneo Island ) .
He is now in Israel .
Then I know backpackers are always freewheeling .
I do n't understand how it works yet , however , I ca n't help posting my first diary .
Actually , everybody in my company counts on me when it comes to English , for example when working with customers or translating documents from the U .
But as you can see , my writing ability is like childs play .
I 'm always dreaming about having my English compositions proofread by native English speakers .
If you notice something , for example , grammatical errors , or unnatural expressions , please tell me .
This time , I tried writing a diary without using my dictionary .
May it be sunny tomorrow . . .
May it be sunny tomorrow . . .
I 'm planning to go hiking with friends tommorow .
I hope it 'll be sunny . .
It is said that you can be healthy and happy or your wish will come true if you climb this mountain .
On the top of mountain , there is a shrine built in the 700 's .
My junior high school friends and I are very interested in this legend .
We will each pack water , lunch , and our wishes in our backpacks .
Because it has been raining for 3 days , I made `` TERUTERU - BOZU `` in hopes of sunshine .
It is an old Japanese custom , although only children do it in these days . . .
Usually it is hung under the roof , but I could n't do it .
Everyone who joined this class was very good .
Even a middle - aged man was better than me !
I am a beginner .
I made a lot of mistakes .
Historically / in the past * , I am a well planned person so there are always schedules that keep me from doing anything spontaneous .
So to speak , there are certain things I have to do almost every day before the sun sets , such as reading a book , watching news , and writing something .
Ironically , I found myself hanging out with my friend who came here in the early morning , taking a whole day from me . We did stupid things like killing flies , making me think of what is more important than that .
I am very stressed right now .
It was very difficult to say anything so I used the wrong words .
so , I spoke English incorrectly .
It was the kindergarten level ~ ~ . .
When I talk , I forget what to say .
My grammer was wrong too .
I y could only say `` I like ~ I want . . ``
Only very simple things .
I felt very tired .
They 're very lovely .
It looks like jewelry .
I thought there were about a hundred thousand people on the ground .
I had never seen so many people , so I was very surprised : ) .
By the way , what do you like to do in the summer ?
Please tell me : D
Yesterday , I went to Home Depot to buy a bag of soil and a planter .
I wanted to repot my roses .
The roses grew and their flowerpots are too small for them .
And also I wanted to sow sweet basil seeds and oregano seeds .
Oh , I just remembered , I also bought a set of starting pots forthose herbs .
It took a long time to do that but I was happy , because I like gardening .
a patio , not a garden .
I wanted to do sowing of Violas but I did n't have enoughstarting pots , so I will go to Home Depo again tomorrow .
a ) I 'm lacking the sensitivity needed to depict whether an expression is formal or informal .
b ) I have to have a sensitivity towards others , or girls wo n't like me .
I did n't like to learn English in school two years ago .
But , I came to like English because I began thinking by myself .
Lang - 8 is good place for learning languages , and it gives us enjoyment .
I 'm able to keep at it .
Especially , in the company , there are many relations .
I want to know how people communicate with each other in foreign countries .
It does n't mean I 'm not doing well .
I think I caught a cold : - (
I took some medicine , but I still feel bad .
Yesterday , I went to a shopping mall called `` Dessert Hills `` and I found a lot of reasonable clothes , bags , shoes and so on .
I bought a lot of stuff and walked a lot . . .
My name is Ella . I 'm Chinese and my Chinese name 's Momeifen .
I work in an e - commerce company .
I like English , but I do n't speak in English regularly , so my English has been declining .
I hope you can understand this
I was n't able to drink alcohol because of medicine . I wanted to drink , though .
But I enjoyed the drinking party !
Although I want to write more about it , I am sleepy
Because he still wanted to play .
I always watch TV on a Saturday night .
I ca n't watch TV on weekdays Because I am working .
I like comedy story and history story .
Today , I enjoyed a TV program about little boy 's and girl 's first errands .
Their parents send them on their first errand .
It was a little bit expensive for me , but I was so happy to get it .
I carry it everywhere , and show it to my friends .
I decided that I 'd manage it carefully to not break it .
Sometimes , When I get back from college , I feel that I can do absolutely nothing but watch a movie .
I feel so exhausted but I can not sleep because If I slept then when I wake up , I 'd have to start studying again or go to college .
Epitome of Cool
Here is the ending .
The afterquake is still happening in Japan , Kanto area .
But the stuation is being recovered by help not only from other Japanese but also from countries all over the world .
Unfortunately , we ca n't say there is no problem at the Fukushima reactor .
I am going to move out to Saitama ( in the Kanto area ) from where I currently live just because I study at the university in Saitama .
I 'm very worried about the radiation .
We do n't know when the situation will recover perfectly .
The worst thing in the world is sitting in a room with only your pen and watching the time go away
Pray for me : D : D
Reading Books in the Bath
My favorite time is when I read books while taking a bath !
I usually take a bath for more than half an hour .
I think reading about others ' love affairs does n't make any sense for me .
I like the stories that are unexpected / surprising , like a roller - coaster .
I expected an earthquake would occur while I was washing my face in the morning .
I 'm so nervous about earthquakes .
I prepared an emergency bag in case .
And I have to fix my furnitures to prevent from slipping .
It was very nice .
We walked around the garden , we saw the animals and differents trees ; we had a small lunch
I like making a plan , but I ca n't follow my plan .
I think I 'm a lazy person , so I tend to choose an easy way out .
I want to do many things in one day .
On the other hand , I think I spend too many hours using the computer .
It is fun indeed , but it is a waste of time for me .
If I stop checking sites so often , I think I can save more time .
I need to reconsider how I use / manage my time .
Though I 'm not good at managing my time at all , I want to try to be good at it .
I will make a good schedule which I will follow .
I want to have stronger mind to keep my schedule , and I want to control my time , not let time control me .
Hi everyone it 's been a while since I wrote my last diary here .
On Friday I was Scream and on Saturday I was a blond haired girl .
It reminded me of a high school festival .
What I found through clubing as a girl is that some guys are so disgusting ! !
Especially one guy who tried to dance with me was so disgusting ! !
He was getting too close and touching my ass with his leg even though I 'm a man .
The club had some small stages and I was dancing on it then a guy came to dance with me .
After 5 or 10 minutes of dancing , at last he noticed that I was a man .
He was like ' OMG ! ! ' n held his head .
Anyway I enjoyed it a lot ! !
I wasted too much time watching Youtube .
I watched without any real desire to watch .
Political ones often are full of childish swearing .
I was interested in how they explain the book which I read few years ago ( in Japanese ) only the begining and gave up .
These oversights are sometimes massive .
`` Exile `` is the one of the most famous vocal groups in Japan .
But today , I 'll introduce to you a very rare unit `` Okaxile `` .
And he leads the dance in this song .
He has a funny and interesting dance .
You can check other videos of Okaxile .
It 's been a while since I wrote a diary on lang - 8 .
Well , _ I 'm into Ray Charles 's song _ `` Hit the Road Jack `` _ recently .
This Youtube video has such a good symphony of music and such good images .
By the way , _ what can I say when something is very good ?
I imagine only `` cool `` or `` awesome `` or `` dope `` .
Plese tell me if there are any other often - used words that mean `` very good . ``
There are only 10 days left of this year .
Time flies like an arrow .
This year , I have taken up the challenge of learning English again .
It is really thanks for my wife , who has started learning English .
We 've really enjoyed this experience .
We will continue learning English next year and after .
Suddenly , I 've departed for DamYang , located in southern Korea , with my camera .
- First , I 'll go to GwangJu by bicycle .
Inevitably , I had to go to DamYang by bus .
Today is the Asia Champion League 's first match .
My team will play in Kuwait at 10 PM , Kuwait time .
My grammar is very poor , and my poor grammar always drives my SAT grammar teacher crazy .
Finished one of my jobs ! !
Korean since its common in my sister 's work place .
Luckily , I have some Korean friends so I worked on it while asking
my friends whether the translation is correct or not .
I was really really cautious at translating this because it 's a national
this is just an excuse .
Anyway I did my best and finished .
Keeping a diary is difficult for me .
I want to keep a diary everyday , but it is not a simple thing for me .
I think my English ability is poor , so thank you very much for your advice .
It was a margherita pizza .
I like cheeze and a basil .
I want to eat it again someday .
We sat in outdoor seats .
Today , it is hot and the sun is shining
So , I got sunburned a little .
I feel summer will come soon in Japan .
I like winter more than summer .
So , I hope that summer will pass quickly .
Strange Japanese customs ?
An interesting TV show aired last Saturday .
One of them is drinking alchole alcohol outside , because most countries do n't seem to allow this .
It is not a smart behavior in Japan either , but we have a big fuss once a year outside .
During that season , no one pays much attention even we are drunk , and make noise .
The next moment we rather become friends with other groups that are enjoying themselves around us .
In Japan , there are strange customs as mentioned above , like hanami .
During hanami , we have to find a place before starting .
It seems to be highest priority .
So , whenever I pass by , I am sure they must be new employees .
Today , my country is raining .
It was very hot and dry .
Unfortunately , we have to finish term examinations .
I can not come on here for around 2 weeks .
If a test is over , I will come again .
He has worked as a customer service representative about insurance .
So he will try to study something in that time .
But he has no idea what he should study .
At the moment , the Japanese economy is bad
We are concerned about losing our jobs .
If he loses his current job , he would n't know what to do .
Now , the Wii is at my house .
The recent TV game is amazing .
It is very convenient that its cordless .
By the way , do you know ' Lucky Taxi ' ?
Yesterday , I took a taxi , the driver give me a card . ( picture )
It was a somewhat happy day .
Are these sentences correct ?
Children cry to get / attract their mother 's attention
Today , I had a lot of free time .
So , I thought about what I would do .
Then , I remembered a very important thing .
That my room was very messy , because I ' v been busy recently .
So , I worked very hard to clean my room .
I was really tired afterwards .
T `` it was a challenging time .
It 's easy for me to study .
I do n't like science as well .
I went back home .
I then went to the park .
I enjoyed playing soccer and baseball with my friends .
It may rain at any moment .
Please lend me a pen to write with .
I 'm no longer suprised about that situation .
All I want to know is the reason why they could n't come to my calss .
I asked someone about the reason why they were not here .
He explaned the reason in Swahili , so I was n't able to understand , but I realized that they were being punished .
Do you remember my journal entry that I wrote 2 days ago ?
Today 's class is the same class which I was n't able to teach them because of CHOTA MAJI .
Tanzanian students are different from Korean students .
When I was in Korea , if we skipped the class because of other affairs , they seemed very happy .
However , in here , my students do n't want to skip the class .
Whenever I have a class at night ( actually , sometimes we have an extra class at night like today ) , I was satisfied with my students who listened devouring every word .
So I have to dig out my first MP3 ( 1GB ) out from my drawer .
Well , it ca n't satisfy me .
And I fell in love with the library at our school ! ! !
I always stay there for a long time
By the way , listening to music there is also a good choice ~ ( ha , ha )
Do you take naps ?
I used to lie down on the sofa after eating .
Recently I read a book about digestion .
According to the book , taking a nap is not good for digestion .
It says that even if we are sleepy after lunch , we should not sleep .
If we get very sleepy , we should go for a walk to forget about our sleepiness .
Finally I decided to try it .
After lunch today , I brought the book to the sofa and began to read it .
But two hours later I found I had been sleeping for that time .
After all that , I went to sleep today too .
I wonder if I will be able to stay up tomorrow .
My sister took entrance exams a few days ago , and she 's waiting for her results .
My brother will take it this Friday .
My sister is at a university , my brother is in high school .
First , I can see some movements of peoples who have recovered from the damage now .
When the earthquake had happened , the economic activity was strongly depressed .
We thought that it was not good to have satisfied days when people in the damaged area have suffered .
Although that , we have already realized that the stagnant economy was even worst for the recovery of the Tohoku area .
For instance , the usages of the area contaminated by the nuclear energy are now discussed on the Japanese newspapers frequently .
I hope Japan will recover from this situation and reply on other countries for their helps in the future .
Japan 's energy policy
Because of the great big earthquake on March 11th , Japanese energy policies have changed drastically .
Many people claim that `` We should not use nuclear power plants ! ! ``
It 's true that radiation impacts people , vegetables , soil , air and the sea .
However , I do n't think that nuclear power plants should be stopped immediately .
If we ca n't use electricity to the full extent , electricity fees will increase and some corporations might decide to move their factories to a foreign country .
If that happens , Japan 's employment rate will face great difficulty .
Most Japanese people ca n't speak English .
So if we lose our employers , we ca n't get jobs !
After that , we can change our electricity source into a natural one .
We should n't change our energy policy if we ca n't do it safely .
This is like the thing which Japanese wives often say : `` Which is more important ? Me or your work ? ! `` .
It 's the same kind of question .
She always answers incorrectly at the same questions that I had taught several times , like a negative number multiplied by a negative number is a positive number .
She just casually answered the questions and sort of appeared impatient , which made me sort of angry .
Yet , I have reflected on my behavior back home .
I had heard of it before but I 've never played it and neither had any one over there .
After playing beerpong , many people played with it but a funny thing happened on that day .
Two guys were competing against each other , racing in an athletic game .
Neither of them knew how exactly to run in the game .
One of the guy tried to run by lifting up his knees a lot and the others did not .
Actually , it requires lifting up their knees high enough to make the Kinect sensor to sense their move , so he was correct and had fastest speed in the race .
However , the problem is he was a bit too serious so he started moving toward the TV monitor little by little , then finally he slipped on a floor and fell down .
As a result , suddenly he became 7th in the race which is the second from last .
So , the race turned out really funny since one guy fell down and the other guy ran at a slow pace .
They ended up getting 7th and 8th .
Everyone started laughing and I was feeling like it was a documentary of a race with a guy who did n't give up even though he fell down in a middle of the race and a guy who kept running slowly but never gave up .
Be careful running even though it 's a game .
^ ^ It seems like nothing , but it brings very real happiness to me .
At the same time , I want to learn how to say no gently because I want to have much happier moments other than sleeping in the morning !
I 'm their elder sister .
I do n't know what gifts my parents prepared .
In the evening we will have a little barbecue .
And of course , some of our friends will be here with their kids .
UW stands for University of Washington , which is located in a beautiful city named Seattle .
Before I went to school this morning , I spent one hour jogging around a big lake called Green Lake near my neighborhood .
I went to balloon lecturer as an assistant at `` OMOCHA OUKOKU `` .
The main lecturer was `` DOISAN `` from `` MAGIC POT `` .
Although today was a rainy day , many people participated in the balloon lecture .
Almost all of the audience was comprised of families .
It was difficult to lecture to small children .
I Miss You In Loneliness
We live in the world for reasons , some of us live only to live with their parents and so on .
I am not one of them , but I miss someone with my heart and soul when I feel lonely .
The first one who comes to my mind is my grandma .
My mother committed suicide when I was only one year old , and since my father worked far far away in a town , I was brought up by my Grandma .
As a child , being naughty , I brought about a lot trouble to Grandma , sometimes I even broke her heart .
Every time I go home , she always says : `` Oh , my son !
You are so thin , more than ever ! `` And then she makes great food for me .
That 's my Grandma , in whose heart , I am always a child .
Then I think of my father .
When I was about 7 years old , I went to a primary school in town and lived with my father in his school .
Grandma made me human and Father made me a person .
He always encourages me saying that I am the best son in the world , if only I can persevere , I can achieve whatever I want .
While I was 16 , I did a lot of bad things , but they never abandoned me .
So here I want to tell you how much I love them .
There are far less tourists on that island than Saipan or Guam .
There is no shopping mall , no duty free stores but there are a lot of natural places there .
You may feel bored if you like modern cities but I love it there .
Actually I have been there eleven times !
I think the ocean of Rota is the most beautiful in the world .
The locals are very friendly and are quick to make friends .
Every time I come to Rota , they always say `` welcome back ! `` .
They invite me to their BBQs , picnics and to their hunting trips ! !
This time , they took mecoconut crab hunting .
It was a really exciting experience .
Coconut crabs are active at night so we went to a coconut forest at night .
They eat coconuts , so it 's flavor is similar to that of a coconut .
There is a big difference between what is ideal and realistic .
Sometimes , you will have to accept something hard or bitter in your life .
I 've never experienced life this hard before .
I will try to make the gap between my ideal and realistic life short , but it 's not going well lately even a little bit .
The only person who can change yourself is you .
I am Yuu .
I 'm just beginning Lang - 8 .
My hair is not black .
because , I color it : )
I will have strengthened muscles for spring vacation
Today 's weather was rainy .
I went to the gym in Neyagawa city so that I can strengthen my muscles .
Maybe , I do n't have as much muscle as the average man .
So I want to strengthen my muscles .
Later around 5pm , I went to work at Lowson , which is a convenience store .
Work was easy today , because of the rain .
That is to say , when it is rainy people are reluctant to go out .
I was upset last night , so I went out for some fresh air .
My boyfriend often condemneds me for being against him .
So I try not to oppose his suggestions , but I felt it is useless .
No matter how much of an effort I make , he never changes his mind .
This made me hurt , so I went for a walk for a while but he text - messaged me ' You do n't have to come back !
Tuesday , January 4 , 2011
I made folded egg make carefully .
My sister made eggs .
So , I completed the eggs .
Finished as mom came in the house .
Mom batted an eyelid .
So we all ate , and it was delicious .
I 'm bad at remembering .
I went to a restaurant with my friend from swimming school last Friday .
At first we swam in class , and after that , we went out .
We could n't decide where we should go , but the coach recommended me a good restaurant .
The restaurant is near my friend 's house .
I asked her if she knew it .
She answered `` I do n't know it ! `` So we looked for it and we easily found it .
She said , `` I did know it !
You and I came here once before ! ``
`` You brought me to this restaurant ! `` , I remembered .
I am stupid , but my friend is too !
And people seem as if they were constipated ( this word is funny because in Spanish `` constipado `` is `` cold `` , and it 's easy to mistake the meaning xD ) .
But I 've been happy , and I 've seen a teacher that was happy too .
In other news : I 've finished my sculpture !
However , if I do n't get enough sleep , I feel depressed .
On Sunday , there were no activities and no plans .
It was supposed to be a good time to sleep longer .
I 've been wondering why I want to study English .
I will arrange my thought in English and write down here as soon as possible .
I have a feeling that is different from others .
But I suppose everybody has a reason why they want to study a second language .
I think everybody has a different reason .
I feel happy that I 've got my answer .
I want to study hard to prove my answer .
Today 's work has ended .
In ( ? ? ? ) , my summer holiday started today .
I have taken a week off .
What a happy person am I : - )
I 'll go on a trip to Kyushu Japan next monday .
I ca n't wait until Monday ! ! !
I remember that when I was child , I could not sleep at night before an excursion .
My father was once a DJ in a club during his youth , so he got many LP records and CDs .
I could come into contact with a lot of music , from Billboard to Classics , because of it .
Actually , I was truly the blessed one .
As you may or may not know , my father 's generation was absolutely poor .
Everything was completely destroyed , including music .
But there were US Armed Forces in Korea , and they radio broadcast their Billboard songs .
My father listened to those songs from the radio everyday and recorded them ( which is illegal these days . . . ) and dreamed of his future .
Even though he could n't eat his fill , he was happy filling with music .
He spent all of his money to buy the records or a guitar ( or guitars ) .
Anyways , I got his blood in my veins , and I 'm really into the music also .
Both emotionally and physically .
Those records he bought during his youth are now real valuable stuff : )
My English skill is not very good .
Hi , this is the first sentence I write here on lang8 .
I 've been thinking about what kind of topic would be good , and then I 'm writing these random sentences .
Before I went to London , I almost could n't speak English . And my English is worse than an average for a Japanese .
But I had the opportunity to improve my English while I was in London .
I know my reading and writing is not so good yet , and this is the one of the reasons why I decided to write this sentence as well .
Anyway , I would appreciate it if you would read this letter .
Today is a good day , and I 'm gon na go to Starbucks to get a coffee or something .
What Would You Do If You were Stressed Out ?
These days , I 'm stressed out because of work .
Though I like to behave appropriatley , it 's not easy to take control over my sensitive personality .
These days I 'm easily pissed off regarding tiny things .
If I keep going , before long , I might be known as a picky woman amongst colleagues .
Anyway , I made a list of ways to reduce stress . You can see them below .
Eating sweets .
Playing musical instruments .
Having conversations with friends and family
The easiest way is eating sweets .
But I 'm afraid I 'll gain weight .
It would be sad if I got chubby because of being stressed .
If I had no sweets during hard work , I would suffer from stomach ache because the more stress I have , the more gastric acid my stomach creates .
I do n't know which is worse . Gaining weight or having an aching stomach .
It 's a catch - 22 situation for me .
Speaking of falling asleep , it 's the best way for me to reduce the stress .
Nevertheless , it is not appropriate to sleep because of time constraints .
I desperatley need to find other ways to reduce stress .
I 'm want to hear about it .
Last month , I received an old laptop computer from my mother , because she bought a new computer .
So I installed a new OS called `` Ubuntu `` , which is a Linux distribution and free . It does seem alot faster than the former operating system .
The PC running Ubuntu is running as well as any new PC .
I am writing this entry on it while listening to music .
Maybe , Microsoft will have a problem in the future ?
I 'm going to translate my blog
I decided to translate my travel blog into English .
First I will improve my English skills , and secondly I 'll have a blog in English
Because in the past people often asked me if I have a blog .
I replied , `` Yes I have one , but in Russian `` . So I think it 's time to create an Englishversion .
I am a college student .
I live in Chongqing .
Today is a special day .
Drugs ' name 's are difficult to pronounce .
Usually , can a native English speaker pronounce difficult drug names
For instance , when you saw an article in today 's newspaper about a drug ,
Can you pronounce it at first glance without consulting a dictionary or website , etc . ?
By chance , can you pronounce them correctly only by recognizing the alphabet ?
In the case of Japanese , we can not pronounce some Kanji .
My son left for Australia last night .
I did n't know whether he 's worried about it or is looking forward to it , but I hope that it will be a special and wonderful experience for him .
I practice writing stories with some words and phrases that I studied today .
I wrote a story , today .
I wo n't accept this .
When I went to school today ,
Our teacher was angry because recently many people were bringing things like chocolates , or their cell phones to class .
But I never bring these things .
So I am innocent .
But my teacher said `` If you find a person with anything like chocolates or a cell phone , you are responsible for warning the person .
If you turn a blind eye to it , then you are also responsible . ``
But I was unconvinced , because I think that those people will not listen to a warning anyway .
I am always wearing my pedometer .
Every day , I look forward to recording the distance I have walked .
My wife washed it without knowing the pedometer was in the pocket .
Previously she washed the iPOD I accidentally left in my pocket , after that it did n't work anymore .
My wife said `` You are wrong for leaving something in the pocket . ``
I said `` You are bad to wash my clothes without checking the pockets first . ``
I will take an English exam on June 12th .
This examination 's name is `` EIKEN . ``
EIKEN is a popular English exam for Japanese people .
I think that the EIKEN exam is made by Japanese people for compulsory education students .
Of course , usual adults are also able to take the exam .
However , EIKEN has been somewhat replaced by TOEIC .
The TOEIC examination is probably the standard English examination all over the world .
I feel TOEIC is more difficult than EIKEN .
And then , I will take the EIKEN exam .
I just ca n't stop sneezing today because of hay fever . ( + _ + ) I take medicine every morning , but it does n't work these days . |
Today , I ran about 5km along the river .
Jogging makes me feel very comfortable .
According to brain science , Jogging raises serotonin levels .
Last Sunday , I went to Kamakura .
It 's famous for Ajisai ( hydrangea flowers ) .
In June , many Ajisai come into bloom in Kamakura .
Many people visit there .
Walking in Kamakura is enjoyable because of it 's good atmosphere .
I went to a Piano competition with my host family .
The older host brother got second prize !
I think that that competition was big .
It 's the Spring drizzle . I do n't mind to get soaked through . . . ?
I heard someone on TV said `` It 's the Spring drizzle . I do n't mind to get soaked through `` .
I have a marathon to run today .
I do n't like running in the rain very much for sure .
That is why I said so as above .
Umm , okay , okay , It is just a Spring drizzle , I will run soaking through it !
Then , I bought a notePC at Big Camera .
So , I wrote this diary whit it ! !
It was very difficulet when I tried to set up this PC .
I will practice with it !
Even though I say it myself ( what ? ) , I 'm using some soaps that do n't contain chemical substances .
I heard that some detergents can be harmfull when they are drained into the river or ocean , rendering local people unable to avoid some dangers from the pollution .
From the looks of it , eco - concious might be the watchword from years to come . ( What ? )
Yesterday evening I had insomnia . My mind is a mess and full of all things !
In order to drink , I finished my work early .
I drank with my co - workers after a long . time .
But , one of them was on leave . So , hecould n't meet with us .
But I felt as if I should help him in some way .
Maybe if I could talk to him about his problem , he might not be on leave because of it .
I went to the rock climbing gym .
I could climb more than last time because my hip 's getting better .
I felt that health is the most important thing for humans .
I was tired , nevertheless , I went to the gym .
I 'm happy being able to go to the climbing gym .
Because I could meet my friends whom I am always eager to meet .
Afamous Japanese climber named Yuji accomplished many feats there .
I tried some new challenges but they weretoo difficult for me .
After all , I did n't manage to pass level five of the challenge .
I ca n't speak English well .
I went drinking with Nobu afterword .
A thief opened his gyvewitha note and killed himself withhis shoelace
An official on behalf of the police station said to the mediathat he killed himself withhis shoelace after opening his gyve witha notethat was in hishand .
I 'm glad to see the official is so imaginative .
I 'm not as irritable so much now but I gained 6kg since then / also and sometimes I wanna eat foods that I did n't eat before .
It 's a little scary .
So I 'll try to find things I like [ more / to do better ] and I have to go on a diet !
It seems that it has been a very hard day for me today .
It was because I felt gloomy unconsciously .
I do n't know the reason on why I was so annoyed about everything .
Was it just because I have lots of lessons ?
I got out of temper to my friends as much as I felt sorry for her .
She understands me well because we are best friends .
As tomorrow is a school holiday , I 'll take a rest at home comfortably .
If someone is gloating too much .
You are exaggerating too much .
I am in Wuhan now
It took me 7 hours to drive from Shiyan to Wuhan . I am very tired , but when I think that I will see my dear brother here tomorrow morning , I am so happy !
I like K - Pop
I really like K - Pop . My favorites groups are ss501 , Super Junior , C .
Blue , 2NE1 , and Girls ' Generation . . . .
Every day you have a different feeling .
from other countries , and many Japanese people .
They could speak English fluently , which made me think that
I have decided to start writing for a Teacher 's exam next winter .
I 've heard that The United States introduced a system that rates the teacher ' s
What I thought was the most interesting , was that this system assesses teachers with students scores .
I do n't think students scores should be the standard for an establishment .
For example , varieties of teaching methods and materials should be involved in the criterion for assessing the teachers .
A fern begins to grow on the structure named prothallus , which is green and whose shape is similar to a heart mark , and a fern is brought up / / will be brought up through a lot of complex events . / / tense consistency
Generally speaking , a `` warabi `` is inedible , but its young stem is edible if you cook it correctly .
When I had a basis check - up at the company ,
I was told to go to a hospital to have another check - up .
The result of my check - up was also anemia .
I have to get the iron by injection , 20 times as a treatment
It will be tough for me ! ! !
I have been staying at my in - law 's house these past three days to spend our new year 's days with them .
I got `` Otoshidama `` from both my husband and my in - laws this morning .
I prayed for our family 's good luck there .
My new year 's resolution is here .
So , this year I want to try to double the amount of books .
I would like to paint 10 artworks a month .
I 'm not good at using the computer and I 'm not familiar with the social networking system in the Internet .
I still do n't know how to use this website , which is very complex for me to understand .
I 've just come back to Japan from Boston and New York .
I visited several clients during the day time and we went to some restaurants and bars at night .
I want to do hundreds of things .
It is sometimes hard because of my poor English ; however I have truly good experiences * . By the way , I moved into a new house last Saturday .
Actually , it was my fifth time moving . . .
I hope this will be my last house even though I have had bad luck with houses .
This one is very nice because it is cute and clean ! !
There is a kitchen , a bathroom and two bedrooms just for my friend and I : D For now I am living with the previous tenant , but my friend is going to move in next Sunday !
I am really looking forward to it .
Well , I am planning to go to school again in September ! !
I should keep writing everyday , really ! ! ! !
I am going to go back to Japan in February .
I want to get much better skills before then . . .
I hope I do my best : P
I have got a new job , so I 'm going to tell my boss that I am quiting .
Yesterday I tried to tell him / her , but I could n't find a good time .
I will do it on monday for sure : )
I have become the director of a company now .
It is going to start on the 1st Feb .
My English friend now is staying at my house in Japan as a homestay .
Besides that I have intention to learn Danish , which will be the sixth language I 'll know .
Interdisciplinary , practical studies , a wide choice of courses , experimental spirit ( ? ) and open - mindedness are reasons why I am so enthusiastic about RU .
It is a pencil sharpener .
It 's so cute !
I 've been learning English for about 9 years with a 4 year break , but I 've never had contact with people who speak English . So I think that in my future posts you will find lots of polish influence .
My idea for a life , I think , is to make all dreams come true doing everything that I can at the moment .
I hate living in one place and doing the same thing everyday .
My favourite subjects are maths and physics , so probably I will have a problem with connecting them with traveling or something like that .
But recently I heard about charity organizations which need engineers and it could be a nice idea .
I departed NARITA airport at 11 : 30 for Singapore .
but I feel tired because of difference temperature between Singapore and Japan .
I slept long last night .
Singapore is in the rainy seasons .
I ` m looking forward to the day when my school starts = )
I am practicing writing compositions to improve my writing ability for the GEPT examination . - - - - - - - - -
If you are studying , you wouldn ` t want someone to bother you .
Last night , Jenny was studying for a test .
If I were an animal , I would be a cat ! !
Actually , I love cats !
When a cat say `` myao ~ `` , I fall in love with the cat .
If I can be a cat , I will go out for a walk the whole day , sleep until I feel good , be along with people when I lonely .
I finished reading the second book of the series `` A Series of Unfortunate Events `` in English .
Compared to the first book , the second one is more complicated .
I would love to finish reading it in three days .
As soon as I saw it fall , I discovered it was a walnut .
It was split open and rolling in the road .
Suddenly , something flew down to get the walnut .
I noticed that a crow dropped the walnut from his beak to the ground in order to break the shell .
The crow must have known gravity existed before we came to understand it .
This happened on one of my busy days , so I felt happy .
summer colds
Nowadays the weather is so hot !
It 's like a steamer outside but inside it is very cold because of the airconditioner .
You may think I make absurd remarks , but I 'm getting sick and tired of using the
It 's so ridiculous !
We should only turn on an air conditioner whenever needed and in moderation .
Recently , I watched ' Gran Torino ' directed and starred by Clint Eastwood on TV .
I think this is one of Clint Eastwood best films .
They were having a lecture about his music career .
He played the contra bass and the guitar .
His music is played at the end of Gran Trino .
I am in my first year of university and I 'm currently studying English and Japanese as main subjects .
I 've always loved learning new languages and these are definitely the ones that I like the most .
I really enjoy learning new words ad expressions and when I do n't know the right way to say something or the right word for something you 'll literally see me running towards the dictionary and grabbing it as soon as I can !
As far as Japanese is concerned , It 's always attracted me in a way and so , since my town has one of the best language insitutes in Italy ( can you say that about a university ? I do n't know . . ) I 've decided to study this charming language . Yes you can say that
Since summer vacation started , I always stayed up to play computer games and even until AM13 : 00 .
Besides , little exercise made me gainweight , so I want to go to the gym and go on a diet .
This title comes from my favorite song sung by Green day , one of many US bands .
As they said , It 's essential for you to know your enemy which causes you trouble .
As for me , Today 's enemy is untidy fat around my stomach !
A few weeks ago , I went to Australia for sightseeing .
The travelling ( Trip ) was very enjoyable , but I ate high - calorie meals many times during my trip .
( In particular , on the plane to Australia , flight crews kindly served me meals five times )
After I came back to Japan , my weight increased by more than three kg before I left .
And I have n't change the troublesome part of my body yet .
It emphasized that it 's important that the calories you consume must be high or equivalent against that you take in .
That 's why I decided to eat low - calorie foods and to go jogging everyday .
Then there were good things and bad things .
The latter is that going outside in winter as much as possible is not normal behavior !
I 'm thinking that Lang - 8 might be a good way to meet someone who speaks native English .
Does anyone know a English speaker who wants to study Japanese ?
Please let me know .
In exchange , I can teach them Japanese !
When I was enjoying chatting at about 3 - ish , I considered going to bed , but I thought if I went to bed once I would n't be able to wake up at 6 and continued chatting till I went to school .
I was a bit sleepy at school , so I decided not to do that again .
Almost all japanese businessmen use the train .
Some of them browse the net on their mobiles , some read some books , and others sleep on the train .
Sometimes those who are seated lean against me .
And they 're heavy .
I think they are very tired at their office , because of having to work so much
So they want to sleep as much as possible .
Today peoplesitting next to me were .
I 'm a Japanese woman .
I want to express my thoughts in English .
I decided that this year , I 'm going to write a diary every day , and I 'll get my English corrected by people on Lang - 8 .
She is Japanese , and works as a nanny in England .
So , I want to speak in English to her .
Plant a young tree
Yesterday father and I planted some young trees .
There are five kinds of trees which are about one or two - years old .
They 're maples , vines , and some korean native kinds of trees .
Before we went to our garden to plant , we went to a restaurant for lunch .
Then we met my eldest sister and her husband by chance in the restaurant .
My broter - in - law , who 's name is Mr .
Park , joined .
And we planted trees and cleaned the garden .
It took about two hours to finish .
Yesterday , a friend of mine recommended this website to me .
To a new comer like me , it is a really interesting and useful website .
I find what most appeals to me is that one can improve his or her ability in a foreign language while / making new friends from all over the world .
This Disney cartoon was very funny and amazing to us .
My mom , younger sister , and I decided to go to see the movie this morning .
The tickets are expensive because they include 3 - D glasses to see the movie .
I love Disney movies .
I went to a hot spring today .
It occurred to me that Japanese people do n't hesitate to take a bath with others , but we are shy to talk with foreigners .
I think that 's why Japanese are shy .
What do you think about this ?
An annual meeting of neuroscience society will be held from the next Saturday to Wednesday in Chicago .
This is the first time to go to U .
And I have never been on international flight alone .
I know almost nothing about international travelling !
And sometime people say `` U .
So , I 'm really anxious about this trip .
Today I bought a book by Morimi Tomihiko at the bookstore in my college , where all the college students and teachers can buy books at a five percent discount off the regular price .
Most of the Japanese colleges have such bookstores . ) The title of the book is ' Kitsune No Hanashi . ' ( ' Kitsune No Hanashi ' means ' A story about a fox . ' ) I find the story very mysterious .
I do n't think Morimi Tomihiko is well known through out the world , so let me explain who he is .
Now he lives in Kyoto and the settings of most of his novels are in Kyoto .
Although many of the main characters in his novels are dull college students , his literary style is very colorful and sophisticated !
In Japan , his books are very popular among young people , especially college students .
Whenever I read his books , I am fascinated by his wonderful literary style .
Furthermore , his stories are very enjoyable .
Anyway , I am fond of his books .
But I 'm afraid his books are very difficult to translate into other languages .
I 'm going to finish reading ' Kitsune No Hanashi ' today .
, After that , I have to concentrate on preparing for next Sunday 's STEP test !
Because I want to draw CHARTS in excel using python , I 'm reading Microsoft Excel binaries .
The Excel binary format is known as `` Compound Document `` .
The first sector is a `` header sector `` that points to the `` dictionary sector `` , and to data structures like the FAT ( file allocation table ) in the FAT16 / 32 filesystem .
The byte stream is a sequence of BIFF Records .
I had never had exprerience of a hall stuff member before , so I always be tensed up during working .
Recently , I felt a little relax because I got accustomed to working as a hall stuff member .
Today is the most busy in my experience days .
I could not only have a break but drink a glass of water .
Tomorrow , I have a work as a hall stuff member but I have a day off after tommorrow , so I can not stand it .
The US president Bush will finish his term in office soon .
I 've always thought he is really incapable and dull .
( Again , it 's just my personal opinion . ) In spite of being incapable , people can still be politicians .
There are many such politicians in Japan , too .
Probably , they also could be a head of state , if they had someadvantage , such as crowd - pulling charisma .
So I 'm wondering what Bush 's advantage is .
I still ca n't think of anything .
According to the news , the shoes were not the reporter ' s
He prepared big and heavy shoes for the attack .
If it had hit Bush , he would have surely gotten injured .
Then , finally , I discovered Bush 's advantage .
Whatgood reflexes he has .
He has cat - like reflexes .
I wonder if he played any sports when he was younger .
If that were a Japanese politician , they would get hit and injured terribly .
I do n't think he could be the US president due to his good reflexes though .
I 'm sure you 've already seen it a lot , but have another look at those incredible reflexes !
Especially , the first throw !
Next month , I will be attending a college .
I 've become foolish .
I belong to a tennis club .
I usually play tennis six times a week .
The one in the background is unknown , because I have forgotten what was printed on the name tag of it .
The sandwich costs 280yen . I ate that one first .
I probably ca n't get raw ham at ordinary stores .
It tastes high - grade , hum ! + lolwut ? +
Today is monday . I just finished my holiday and arrived back from my hometown .
Now I 'm working in my company and I feel a little tired . Maybe I enjoyed too much during this holiday , so I ca n't acclimatize myself to different place or people , etc .
I think in a few daysI will be fine . ( `` can get right `` sounds awkward and unclear )
Recently , I 've been feeling really bad .
That makes me feel very bad .
I think I need time to relax to help me fix this problem .
So I will do more exercise to relax .
I think I can make this problem go away .
I dropped in at a department store at Nihombashi on my way back home .
After four days , I hold a Christmas party .
I will exchange with my friends presents gathered by us .
It costs about 1000 Yen per present .
I was at a loss for a while , but I bought a shoes - keeper that include deodorizers .
Nanotechnology is one of the most promising areas for the science and technology field .
Because of its particle size , which is less than 100 nm , a nanparticle has different mechanical , physical , chemical , and electronic properties than that of bulk materials .
An engineered nanoparticle has many applications such as drug delivery , solar cells , clean manufacturing process , cosmetics , and so forth .
Venture capitals , governments , and industries have invested tremendous amounts of money for spurring the innovation of nanotechnology .
While the bright side of emerging nanotechnology has been extensively covered by media , the safety of nanoparticles has only attracted a small amount of attention .
Because of its size , a nanoparticle could be inhaled when we are exposed to it .
Once a nanoparticle is in the environment as a product or as a byproduct from factories , it is practically impossible to detect because of its size .
English pronunciation
I have worked for an American company for 4 years .
All of my colleagues are bilingual .
Of course , each have different levels of English proficiency , but my company requires that each person scores at least 730 points on the TOEIC .
Therefore , our employees ' English proficiency is higher than other Japanese companies .
Other countries , Germany for example , most of their employees can speak English rather than Japanese .
Hence , 730 TOEIC points are common for them .
But an English accent is not associated with TOEIC score .
Even if people have a 900 TOEIC score , their pronunciation is not good .
I found out this fact when I jumped on with this company .
A woman colleague can write English e - mail very well but she speaks with a very strong Japanese accent .
It 's difficult for us to improve the pronunciation by only reading or writing foreign language .
For Americans , Japanese `` Futon `` is a mysterious sound because shape of mouse for `` Fu `` is different between American English and Japanese .
I 'm ca n't speak english very well , but I really want to be fluent in my English skills .
I want talk about many stories but it 's difficult . . . .
English class is the hardest .
I ca n't understand my english professsor 's lecture . . . .
I do not understand how use of prepositions such as in , on , at , and of .
it was rainy today .
it was very difficult ! ! ! !
It was to test whether we could write characters beautifully .
It is very bright , sunny and dizzily hot today .
Please take care not to get dehydrated or suffer from heat stroke .
It 's probably better not to be exposed to the sun and heat for a very long time .
Enough water and electrolytes will help prevent suffering from the heat .
Take care and enjoy summer as much as possible .
I like five - toed socks and wear it almost everyday .
They are quite comfortable because my feet do n't get sweaty .
One day , a friend of mine found me wearing five - toed socks and said to me , `` I know they 're comfortable and I like them too , but ca n't wear them .
When my mom was wearing five - toed socks , dad said that it was enough to turn off even a love that lasted a 100 years ( a Japanese proverb ) .
Mmm , it may look a little goofy , but I do n't think it 's that bad .
How would you feel if your girlfriend or boyfriend wore them ?
You should try wearing them if you have never .
Something Funny !
My friend Philipp and I went to the office this morning by bus .
He had to call the guy who would hand the key over to him .
The key was entrusted to him by Philipp 's German friend .
At beginning , `` # $ % ! @ # % ! @ # $ `` Philipp said in German , but the one on the opposite end of the phone line did n't reply .
So Philipp said , `` Do you speak German or English ? `` And then , they began to chat in English .
After two or three sentences , he asked , ' Do you speak Chinese ?
And he turned out knowing how to speak Chinese .
The guy is a Chinese like we are . .
I was laughing until we got out of the bus .
I have started an English tweet .
I 'm going to tweet about daily life , family , sports , my job and more in English .
If you 've have twitter account , please follow me .
Japanese marriage system
In my country , we do not need to vow when we get married . [ Correct but weird ]
Brides and grooms simply go to city offices and turn in the marriage application form , which has the brides ' , the grooms ' , and twowitnesses ' signatures .
No picture IDs are required to turn in the marriage application form .
The law does not even require the couple togo to the city office .
Somebody else can go there instead of the couple .
Because of the system , sometimes problems arise .
When a couple goes to the city office to turn in their marriage form , they sometimes find out that one of them ( or both of them ) is already married to someone else .
No one person has received more praise and abuse than Steven Jobs , who is the CEO of APPLE & amp ; PIXAR corporation , as well as being cover person for over 200 famous magazines .
I was astonished by Jobs ' lecture spoken at Stanford University in 2005 , which included three stories , and tell us to follow our heart , to find our goals .
He did n't know what the meaning of continuing his study in a college where fees are so expensive that it cost most of his parents ' money .
Instead of this , Jobs started to drop in the calligraphy class in his college , which supplied the one of best calligraphy training in the whole country .
At this time , he was just interested in this class but was n't concerned about awards .
Until he created the first APPLE computer , all the effects what he had done before came back .
Once you trust something and follow your heart as well as work hard , one day when you looking back , you can clearly know the secrets of these dots you have done .
He was expelled on the grant scale from APPLE , which he created .
Nevertheless , he said that he has been rejected , but he will still love .
Dramatically , these striking things let him found his dreamboat , he established a new company ; NEXT , purchased PLXAR and became the CEO of APPLE again .
So do n't ( settle / settle down ) , keep looking your love .
I 'm finally writing my journal . . . . !
Actually , these days are kind of hectic and I could n't spare time for doing it .
But it is a fact that I had n't been writing journal entries .
Even though I skipped doing it for only 1 day .
let me explain them !
First , when I wanted to write , there was something was wrong with my PC !
To make matters worse , I had no time left
As those who have read my journals know , I started working part time ( my job consists of giving out leaflets outside ) and I was kind of busy .
In fact , I worked today too .
I said that I will earn enough money on my own to study abroad in Australia , but this job is a little hard .
LOL In addition , when I do it , people avoid me most of the time . . .
I came back home from the USA yesterday .
I realized many differences between Japan the US during my 3 - week stay on the East Coast .
Secondly , streets in the US are designed in grid style , and each street has its own name .
For instance , the names of the streets are numbers ( like `` E 32 Street `` , `` 5th Avenue `` ) in New York .
I hope will I meet some native speakers and someone
who can help me express myself .
Of course , I would also like to help those who are learning Japanese .
I read an article about Starbuck Instant coffee in the Asahi
I suppose most of American people know it well , as it 's been sold for a year .
My American friend keeps sending it to me , I 've been enjoying it every day .
If you are a Starbucks fan , it would be worth a try .
Sakyo says `` I could n't accept an evolution book like this although I am a sci - fi writer `` .
I have a certain obsession with trains .
I set off at 5 : 30am beneath the moonlight to take the 6 : 00AM train .
What I used to do on the train was gossip about things that happened in class with my pals
whenever I hearthe sound from a / the train station
Today is a very cold day , even though June will come , tomorrow .
I thinkJune is a kind of hot and a very humid season , a Japanese rainy season .
So I hope there will not be high humidity .
I just have been living in Japan , but I very very very hate Japanese humid climate in summer !
Lack of Motivation
But I stayed at home all day doing nothing in particular .
It was a total waste of time .
I think I 'd rather go out than stay at home doing nothing .
But I do n't feel like going out or staying in to write a report .
I always regret it at the end of the day .
It is a very bad morning .
Never walk the streets of St .
Petersburg in - 20 degree weather .
Hot coffee , cigarettes and a warm blanket - this is what I need today .
I 'm crocheting a case for my cell phone .
I would like to show my grandmother and my former students .
If I have extra time , I may crochet a cap for my husband : - )
When I entered senior high school and joined the mountaineering club in 1996 , I bought a head light by Panasonic .
Today 's my first login - day .
I 'm a system consultant .
and I will quit my job at the end of next month .
I will be a home - maker and will take care of my children .
I sometimes go to ECC , ECC is an English conversation school .
My company paid 80 % of the fee for me .
But I will quit it . After that I 'm going to study English .
and I hope to converse with everyone .
Do you know about hot - water bottles ?
It 's a bottle made of plastic or other materials ( I do n't know what exactly ) in which you pour hot water .
You put it in your bed on cold nights , so you can warm your feet and sleep very well .
It 's a wonderful item .
Unfortunately , the other day , I got a small hole in the one that I 've used for several years .
So I went shopping to buy another one .
Fortunately , I found something even better .
It 's kind of like a hot - water bottle , but there are cerry seeds in a bag .
You put it in the micro - wave for 3min , and then it 's ready to be used !
It was a little bit more expensive , but it 's my birthday soon .
So I bought two , one for my feet and the other for my neck and shoulders .
I 'm not interested in Buddhism , but yesterday I studied a little about it .
I came to think that Buddhism has profound teachings .
Buddha is a person who is spiritually awakened .
However , even if we could solve the problems , more problems may arise if we would not solve its roots
Buddha had known the root of , which is common in mankind .
When Buddha helped people in trouble , he had thought not only about the solution of the problem that they face , but also the solution of all troubles
The value of currency always changes .
Even I have done the deal for three years , I am still confused by the movement of the market sometimes .
My trade relies on the two basic forms of analysis : fundamental analysis and the technical analysis .
Fundamental analysis is based on which price will reflect the big news .
Thechnical analysis uses the charts as the objects .
Look at my recent trade ( for example ) :
China supports Portugal and buys the national bonds .
What do you think of my deal method ?
I think everyone has to believe something
Humans are so weak so they always want to believe something .
In korea foreign missionaries have been succssefully brainwashing people .
I live in a small city where the total population is almost 200000 .
but In my city there are hundreds of churches .
every holiday people come into my house tell me about god and if I do n't believe in god I will go to hell .
our country used to believe in budha but since advanced countries opened our market by force 70 % of people are catholics and protestants even old men are starting to go to a church .
It 's good to go to a church but do n't push others to believe it .
he might do n't throw away atheists to hell .
just one reason I did n't believe him .
Hello !
I am a beginner of lang - 8 .
I am a Chinese . I am studying English and Japanese . I hope one day I will be able to write poems in English or Japanese like I do in Chinese .
Language is an art . Culture expression is a door .
Let us open the door and play with the beauty of art .
This is my first post in English .
I registered on Lang - 8 yesterday .
If anyone corrects this post , I 'll be very happy .
By the way , today I took the TOEIC .
I think I got half of the reading section correct , but the listening section was not good .
I could n't understand most of the questions . . .
I must study more / harder .
Thank you for reading , bye !
Something white to drink
I ordered a glass of white drink when I had dinner at a restaurant yesterday .
I did n't know what it was when I began drinking .
Can you guess what was is in the glass in the picture ?
Actually , it was yogurt liqueur .
I go to the training gym and run about three times in a week .
I often listen to rock music , but I want more songs that are speedy and rhythmical .
I hear that music with a BPM of 160 - 180 is suitable for running .
I 'm always looking for songs .
If you have any songs that you would like to recommend , please tell me .
He did not not look well .
So , I took a walk with my daughter and my son for 2 hours .
It is disappointing because we have three days of holiday in a row .
I know this SNS , using learning foreign language , `` iKnow `` ( http ; / / www . iknow . co . jp ) .
Sometimes I go abroad , such as Taiwan and other Asian countries .
English is the most popular language of communication in the world .
I think communication tool can open up some opportunities for us .
If possible , I will speak with foreign people using my English during my work .
The flowers keep blooming and rising up towards the Sun .
Is my friend holding a knife or a gun ?
Everything around you does n't mean a thing .
I am feeling melancholic , which gives me a chance to reflect on the life that has already passed me by .
It hit me and it even made me write a poem .
But sometimes I think that a good life is n't booked for everyone who wants it .
I wish that God held your hand in times full of doubts . .
The moment that lasts can be the best of all that you have had .
You still have new friends , the old ones are covered by dust .
`` English Cafe `` opened every first Sunday of the month . Many students , teachers and Christians gather at the party .
It was different from the usual lesson , and the students and the teachers were relaxed and having fun .
I made many Christian friends there .
I 'm not Christian but I was happy to make friends .
If I were a woman ~
I 'll think for a bit about if I were a woman .
The reason I think of it is because its just enjoyable for me .
If I were woman , my figure would be more lovely than sexy .
I would have long hair hanging down the in front , and the color must be black .
My personality would be rather calm and tomboyish .
Maybe I would n't be so active , so I would n't go to to any clubs .
I would n't be doing so poorly at school , but I would hate studying .
My type would be a man who is a little brawny and has a tender heart .
Good Dinner at Omiya
Fortunately we can use electric power all day long today , so we can spend our day as we usually do .
Yesterday I went to Tsutaya ( the biggest rental DVD and CD shop in Japan .
However , we can buy new DVDs and CDs there . ) with my family because my husband wanted to rent some DVDs from the shop .
And then , I discovered many imported CDs are sold for 80 percent discount .
I 'm very happy because I could buy each CD for only 300 yen ! ! !
That 's very cheap ! ! !
Today is the last day of golden week .
During golden week , I could n't learn any more English .
Starting tomorrow , I am looking forward to learning English again .
I know that I should wear them but they make me look like an idiot .
People tell me to wear contact lenses but I think that it makes my eyes unhealthy by absorbing tears in my eyes .
Truthfully , I have lost more than five pairs of lenses so it is never worth it .
I think my bad eyesight is due to the fact that I like watching , reading , and writing .
All of my good friends moved to a distant place for various reasons .
I 'm very concerned about it .
I have heard of that Mongolian people 's eyesight is very good due to their no buildings and no monitors environment .
They always see well at distance , not like us .
Anyway , someday , I want to get lasik if it can improve my eyesight causing no side effects .
We all should remember to wear more clothes ^ .
The day before yesterday , it was a special date for our young .
It is so called Youth Day which celebrates their contributions to our country .
We are just the flowers growing up healthily and will serve the country after growning up .
I feel fortunate that I can live in a country with such a rapidly developing economy and superior military power .
As a university student in the present age , I have a heavy burden on my shoulders . So , I know that I should have the will to build our country stronger and take every action to gain a good knowledge of science .
We grilled beef , corn and sausages .
I had some beer , which I enjoyed !
A single house
There are several different types of houses in America .
So far , I 've visited town houses , condos , and apartments , but not single homes .
I heard that a single homes are very pricey .
You completely have your own garden without sharing it with others .
Last week , I spent two days at my father 's friends ' place .
It 's a real luxury home .
The landscaping in the front yard is very nice .
The anti ( ? ) maintain it in a very neat and organized way .
Not only is the front yard good but the back yard is too .
They built an outdoor fireplace and a BBQ stove .
It 's two stories high and there 's a spiral staircase .
Every room has its own bathroom and each has two sinks for washing hands .
The most special room has an indoor window in it .
You can stand in it and see the whole panorama of first - floor living room .
The Staff who Valued a Home Event over Work
Previously , I wrote about a test of the radiation contamination for food
The radiation specialty staff have been performing this inspection .
However , our staff were asked to help due to a shortage of test members .
Today the staff who was chosen to be a helper wanted a change of date .
The reason was because he wanted to participate in an athletic meet of his child .
Because we decided the date after having heard the staff 's schedule , this is almost not possible .
I was surprised that there was a staff who valued a home event over work .
I finally get why they won the World Cup .
Of course , my goal is to be as good as a native English speaker .
but I must get a good score with the TOEIC so that I do my best to study English now .
While I get into studying English , my lab has begun the project that lab students have to make a glider robot .
It gets harder and harder working on the project .
We had felt difficulty that we might not make the glider robot .
That ` s why we took a lot of extra time .
I want to use the time study English more than I do .
I ` m reconsidering to make adjustments to my schedule .
I have to never forget to make time for both things .
Life after maternity leave
This is the first time I write a diary in English .
I would really be happy if someone would kindly read and check my English .
Last weekend , my husband was not at home , so I invited my friends over from the company both on Saturday and Sunday .
They said they were busy , and they had to get many days off because their children often got sick .
In her case , her mother lives near her , so she can get her mother 's help , and she does n't need to get off work .
I felt down when I imagined the life after I start working again .
I teach Italian and English ( funny but true ) in an Association where street boys and girls with difficult backgrounds are helped with their homework .
One of the guys was performing in the show so he invited me and other teacher to support him .
What changes happened ?
I want to write about one of the biggest changes tonight .
It is natural , but I have lived with my parents for 27 years .
I was dependant on my parents , and influences from my parents was large * 1 .
I believe my actions was limited to what my parents allowed .
So now I 'm feeling free like a bird leaving the nest .
Fortunately my husband does n't interfere with me .
Now after the marriage , six months passed . * 2
And then I started two things ( hobbies ) , because I felt I could do anything .
I want to write about the new things next time .
My brother will enlist in and enter the Korean military soon .
My brother will enlist in the military .
Korea is divided into South Korea and North Korea .
These days the international news is not good for everybody who lives in Korea .
( You know the news about the Yeonpyeong islands . ) So , my family and my relations are worried about him .
But , he just said that every man in Korea should go into the military , except the disabled .
`` So , do n't worry about me . `` he said .
He joked `` Please buy meat for visiting , esp chicken for dak galbi . . . ``
I 'm looking forward to him coming back home . . .
He will be discharged in 2013 . . .
How long do we have to wait for him ? !
Today was a very busy day .
I went to Gangnam station to study English at the Pagoda academy .
I met my friend who served in the marine .
We talked about the old days for about three hours .
I went to the computer academy after our meeting .
The lecture today was so difficult , however , I did my best to make good program .
Most of the people there are older than me .
especially , the old man sitting n the next to me . He is the oldest person in our class .
He thought it would be very hard to learn to make a program .
He was right .
so , I always help him make programs .
My name is Mari Carmen and I 'm a new Spanish user of Lang - 8 .
I hope to improve my English here and I want to learn French too .
Next year , I want to study for a master 's degree in Design at a British or French university .
I hope to help anyone who needs help with Spanish .
I agree completely with his opinion .
How long they work a day is kind of controlled by the urgent demands from their various stakeholders , so they do n't have any discretionary time . ( ? )
The words spoken out of our mouths are weak , and eye contact is full of confusion .
It reminds me of the Bable story , God separates people with different languages , and people are never united as one any more because of the languages , then the world is full of suspicion and frustration .
Keep going !
Today was so tiring : P
Everything made me crazy
I do n't know what happened maybe I just feel confused .
By the way , a Typhoon is coming soon and maybe a lot of students are thinking , `` whoa I can rest a day , hopefully the typhoon stay in Taiwan `` .
oh , I feel sleepy
ok I want to go to bed , goodnight
I hope to get a better score than the previous time .
Today , I moved house .
I get my own room finally ! !
I was homeless , and stayed at a Hi - hostel in winnipeg downtown .
I arrived here 6 days ago , my visa is working holiday ( permit ) .
So I really needed my room
because the hostel was expensive , it was $ 29 for a day .
But my room is only $ 300 a month and really close to town ! !
But I have to find a job .
Please ~ : ) I wanna work as baker or . . .
Even my english is n't that great .
But I will do my best .
And I have some questions . .
Does this sentence make sense ? ?
Please let me know .
After I entered elementary school , my parents switched from running a supermarket to owning a fried chicken restaurant .
A few years after that , they changed the menu to pork cutlets .
All of my friends envyed envied me .
Now they run a grilled meat restaurant .
When I had my fortune told over the internet , it informed that I had died of hunger at an early age in my previous life .
I would like to write a letter to my English teacher , so I want you to correct my English .
Well . . .
Thank you for everything you did for me .
I do like your explanations !
I really admire your professional teaching style .
Not only that , you are really fluent in Japanese and have already passed the Japanese exam .
I 've never met a native teacher like you who has studied Japanese as hard as you .
I do n't know what I will do without you from now on . . .
Well , I have a present for you .
I will give you a red ballpoint pen .
I will be really happy if you could correct my English someday with this pen .
I took the freeway for the first time .
I 've never taken the freeway before .
Last Sunday was my fathers birthday .
So I went to the Jeongseon - gun where my parents live .
I drove alone , I 'm not afraid of driving anymore .
I 'm good at passing other cars .
Have you ever driven in Korea ?
It 's so overcrowded with a car .
Some of the drivers have no manners .
I do n't submit to any drivers manners because I 'm a brave woman ? ! ^ ^
I do n't go because my ex - husband comes .
He said , `` Do n't leave children , I ca n't take care of them ! ``
He does n't like that I leave my children at church .
But my children like to play at church , and I thought they might feel happy to meet their farther .
I 'm very sad . . . .
I want to be a kindergarten teacher because I like children
I went shopping at Ginza after work .
I bought a deep pink colored shirt .
I felt that the shirt was too tight
But I like it .
I think It 's by far the most great T - shirt .
I got in touch with my girl friend and I said `` I like it very much ! ``
I live in Santiago de Chile , in a small town on the outskirts of the city .
In the first floor I have a kitchen , a living room and a dining room .
At the second floor there are my room and two rooms more for my family .
The walls of my house are yellow , and the ceiling is white throughout the house .
These days , I am always busy .
This is because the test days are near .
I have to do my homework .
In addition , I 'm busy at my part time job ! !
I can hardly wait for spring vacation .
How to get a driver 's license successfully ?
This weekend , I will go to the training ground to learn driving with a trainer .
Though I understand some of it , I have never driven a car .
I am a bit stressed about this training .
How noisy it is outside !
It 's too loud for me to to fall asleep , even though it 's about 4 : 30 am here in Japan .
Nevertheless , my wife seems able to continue sleeping even under
I wonder if we are even safe here .
that the sparks will set fire to its surrounding houses and spread
Who did this ?
are they identical ?
I even did n't realize what had happened until the week had passed .
And it seems that I forgot a lot of things , like finding a part time job , making a call to my Mom .
I do n't really know what I was busy with , it just passed .
First , during the weekday , I got a little busy , and things about my work seemed to get better , because my colleagues treated me much better last week , and they seemed more to believe in me now , except one , who has never said anything nice to me .
Like me , I am not very patient and sensitive about numbers , but now , my work is closely related to numbers , It makes me learn to be much more patient and careful .
And I have learned another important skill , that is to write down everything that you do n't know , or you can not remember clearly , especially things which are very important to your job .
I know that I should be confident , and should be more sensitive , so that my colleagues will believe in me more .
It seemed like I did n't prepare for it well , but it also passed quickly .
In fact , this is my second time to meet a E - friend , both these times turned out well .
Like me , before I went to see my E - friends , I was quite scared , and I was praying for good luck .
But do n't over react to it , because there are also a lot of nice people in the world !
Many big waves are coming from the sea by the influence of a Tyhoon that is approaching now .
It 's a good day for surfers .
I 'm going to go bodyboarding this afternoon .
Last Friday , I passed the final driving test at my driving school ! ! ! ! !
After the test , I said thank you to the instructor who cheered me up when I failed .
Although I could leave the driving school , I was a little sad
Thanks to them , I drive very safely .
Thank you to all instructors in the school ! ! ! !
By the way , my university will start tomorrow .
I want a longer vacation .
Today my friend Kayla , who is American , introduce me to this website .
I 've never written a diary in my life , but I 'm sure I can keep updating my boring days for English training .
This is the first time I 've written something since I arrived in the US .
When I was in Japan , I had thought that I could be a great English speaker if I lived in the US .
But , I was completely wrong .
Japanese siege mentality
Today , Japan is filled with a siege mentality .
Many young Japanese do n't have the motivation ( ? ) to work and are uncertain about their future .
I ca n't see my future too clearly either .
I think the Japanese have a lot of ability , so we can contribute more to the world .
Ooh ! I 'm earning a lot of money .
It 's a sedentary job and I think it 's a cup of tea : )
Mainly because I suck at dealing with customers , or work that requires a fair amount of communication with other workers !
I am looking forward very much to seeing how much money I can make on my own X )
About 3 days ago I wrote a diary entry which said :
I found myself at a loss for words for most parts of the day : (
Thank you for reading all of this !
I want to play well like Federer , who is the No . 1 ATP player .
It 's cold tonight .
yesterday ? Typhoon came , so the sky was cloudy all day , and temperature did not become hotter .
My mother switch on the hotcarpet at home .
We will need to turn on a kotatu , soon .
I started to try writing a diary in English
started to trying writing ? ?
Is it OK ( ^ ^ ; ? ? Yes
I will not write a diary often , but I hope to continue doing it for as long as I can . .
I hope I will continue in this .
After I graduated from a university , I entered some major companies .
And I entered a company which I work now .
Then I 've worked in my second company about 2 years .
So he suggested me to New York .
When I was a student , I did n't study English .
Of course , I could n't speak it !
I still belongs to my company in Japan .
I 'm working in my room just like soho using internet .
I can do Japanese company 's business in NY .
I 'm trying to study English everyday .
I just got back .
I went someplace today .
I ate a very special burger that tasted good .
I think it had a real local taste .
I had fun .
Although I really love playing basketball and volleyball , I still want to go on a trip .
I have said over and over to my mother that I would like to go somewhere for her to give me some money for it .
She did not give me any , and I do not have passport right now .
Do you have any place to recommend for me ? ( anywhere is OK )
I went to the Koshien stadium to watch a baseball game last Friday .
The match held was the Hanshin Tigers versus the Yokohama Baystars .
We rode a bus and a train to get there , and the train was crowded with the people who were going to the Koshien stadium .
There were base runners every inning , and home runs .
We enjoyed it very much , and came home late at night . By Then our youngest son was already asleep .
Introducing myself
Although I do n't know what Thea means , I saw it in a name dictionary by accident .
If you have a more suitable English name , please tell me ~
Lastly , I want to say : Nice to meet you ~ ~ ~
My birthday was three days ago !
That day should be a happy day , but it was n't !
My family had a row .
I felt sad and my sister got out of the house !
I will back to school soon , my school is in another province !
My next time back home will in many month later , I really do n't want to back to school with a broken - heart , but I can do nothing !
Well , it 's very tough for me to figure out what to write because my days always have the same routine .
As always , nothing special happened today .
Well , I have 94 days left until I return to college .
Anyway , I have a plan to go to CheongJu and look for a suitableroom near my college with my friend MinSung on Nov .
Well , I hope that the room will be very silent and calm , not noisy .
In addition to that , I want it to fit my position .
I mean it 'll be great if it wo n't cost me much money , because I do n't really want to burden my parents with the rent
Speaking of which , Minsung and I might have to live together there .
We 've been through this , and he thinks it 's going to happen , but I have n't decided yet .
I 've seen people live together and always always getting into fights with each other about small stuff and end up hating each other .
What if that happens to us ?
But , it would have its merits .
Actually we would use English every time we 're home together to improve our English speaking skills dramtically .
That was Minsung 's idea .
Well , it sounded like a very lovely idea to me when he proposed it , because I 've thought about that too .
Actually I 'm thinking about that .
Well , I do n't know what would be a good decision .
New fiscal year starts in Japan from April .
At my workplace this year 's personnel changes were announced .
So my current boss will move to other post .
And I will get her job .
I 'm working late at the office lately . twice late ?
I need more time .
I have little time to study English .
Are there any funny planning on April ( fool ? ) around you ?
I 'm writing my diary for the second time because wrong . ( ? ? ? )
I am writing the diary and doing a lot of things I check my e - mail and read hi5 . My friends send comments to me . Hi 5 is like facebook . It is very popular in thailand and I chatted with my university friend . We talked about work . She is not working at the moment because I go to out side of bangkok . ( ? ? ? )
she lives with her family . I know her because she went to bangkok to study .
I plan to party this sunday at my closest friend 's brithday .
She advise me to go there and I think I will be happy because after I finished university I did not see them for a long time
maybe we will go home late .
Because we chat a lot .
It is hard to unlock the door to my front door recently .
I think it 's because of the temperature or the humidity .
Teaching children is very difficult for me .
Because they 're so rowdy thatsometimesI ca n't control them .
But also I often get strength from them .
I think I must be tougher and study harder to see them smile .
It 's March and it 's a new semester .
They all look like gentle and good children .
I wish everyone happiness !
Is everything all right ?
I feel alone here .
I wish that everyone is happy !
I did n't know I 've used more muscles to frown so many days .
Why do we feel it 's hard to smile even though smiling uses less muscles ?
Today I 'm going to talk about my morning .
( I 'm not sure which is correct . )
I woke up at 7am , because of my alarm .
Then I hit snooze , instead of turning off the alarm , and I slept until 7 : 20am .
So I had slept about 20 minutes longer than I intended .
It helped me to get up with energy .
And then I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth .
Sorry , I have a big problem with Perfect Tense and especially with Perfect Progressive Tense .
I do n't know exactly when Perfect Tense should be used .
This is the first time I 've written a journal on this site .
I feel a little nervous .
Anyway , it 's Friday !
I am poor at listening and speaking in English correctly .
To speak with correct pronunciation , I read the sentences in the textbook aloud at the bath .
But I do not feel I am making progress with my English .
I 'm so tired today > _ <
because I was drunk last night ~
I need to sleep T _ T ! ~
I need to make a friend ; ;
I ran last night to practice for the marathon race .
But the distance is only 5km - too short to say it 's a `` marathon `` .
Yesterday was so cold and windy it was too hard for us to run .
But we ran for about 1 hour talking with each other .
Training the body is important .
I met my friend .
We played a computer game .
We had a really fun time !
My father is still diagnosed with IV phase of cancer . . .
We usually use an internet conference system .
In such situation , it gives me difficulty of joining a conversation .
I have to fix this problem first
The cherry blossoms are special for the Japanese .
We are looking forward for the cherry blossoms every spring .
The newspaper and the weather forecast inform us when the cherry blossoms come out .
My house is near a post office .
To the left of my house is a barber shop .
When I go to the market I can see many kinds of things , such as a barber shop , a shopping mall , and a kids ' school , as well as my own school .
Mine is a middle class family ; that 's why I live in a middle class family house .
Yesterday I saw `` Like Stars on Earth `` .
Today , I saw the 3 idiots .
These are such great movies .
The director is also the lead actor .
The two movies made me cry , because they made me think about myself .
My Native Accent
I was born in north - eastern region of Japan .
Those who were born there have a distinct accent .
Although there are many accents in Japan , the accent of our area used to be called `` corny . ``
I was made fun of because of my accent in front of my friends when I was a child .
I was so humiliated by my accent during my childhood that I tried to modify it .
That 's why I can speak common accent too .
I took a class to study the structure of Japanese language and became a volunteer today .
Our teacher told us we should not be ashamed of our own accents because each accent was created by their cultures .
She let me speak aloud in my accent in front of other students .
I wonder if many people all over the world are proud of their native languages .
I 'm very proud of my accent now !
Because it was gifted by my ancestors .
Today I had lesson at GABA with a new teacher who was from England .
First I asked him some basic questions , like `` where are you from ? `` , `` what is your favorite Japanese food ? `` , and `` What is your hobby ? `` One of his hobbies was cooking , so we talked about cooking and foods .
I was very surprised that English people liked very hot curry .
Then I talked about my favorite Indian restaurant in Ikebukuro .
Tomorrow morning , I would take a toeic exam in school .
I have taken a toeic exam in Korea ,
It was a long time ago .
When I was in Korea , my one of big problems was my weak English listening skills .
It 's so difficult even now .
but I could n't understand it well .
I have already been living in Toronto for 3 months ,
( Whenever I go to cinema , I get easily frustrated . )
but I could n't understand everything .
When would I be able to understand the news , movies and pop song ?
I am always dreaming that I would be able to travel everywhere without the need for English .
listening nemo
Nemo : Daddy help me
( I could only hear this )
Nemo 's friend ?
Arrow : That Direction ? ?
Narrator : Walt Disney Pictures presents , a PIXAR animation
Turtle father : Totally
Daddy : I 've got to find my son Nemo !
( I could n't hear the first part )
Sharks : fish are friends
Turtle : - - - - - - - - - is coming up man !
Fish : you mean the swirling vortex of terror ? !
Turtle : That 's it , dude ! Go go go !
unknown What are you talking about
so , I was happy .
but my classes ended late .
so , I 'm feeling good .
Me and my friends felt awkward .
Because we have n't seen each other after a long time .
I like my class teacher .
Today 's Diary
Today I was going to go to English school
but I had been working all night
So I will take a transfer class this Friday
Sorry to my teacher
Now I can give my opinion and receive advice from others instead of just letting ( asking ) my friends help me .
What a ( lot of work ) !
What was even more exciting was that I received 9corrections .
I also corrected a couple of entries , however , the my profile status showed just 1 correction was made .
After the interview , I ( will ) help give back more .
I 'm in Tokyo , the capital of Japan , right now .
I attended a seminar how to think while making sentences in English .
Many Japanese tend to translate what they want to say literally .
For example , if I want to say that he is stubborn , I can say he never changes his opinion .
I learned that I need to have more various points of view through this seminar .
After the seminar , some participants , including the teacher and I , went for a drink at a bar .
We talked a lot and had a blast , and it was interesting that one of the participants talked his experiences when he 'd been in Germany .
Incidentally , I 'm writing this entry with / on my iPhone ! !
I usually commute by car , but I 'll use a motor cycle to save money .
However , it is very very slow to oparate .
She ca n't still swim very well yet , so she wanted to use her inner tube the whole time .
But she improved a little after one hour .
I can swim very well because I used to practice swimming in high school during after - school activities .
Anyway , we had a lot of fun .
Of course it is in Japan , but I saw some words written in English : `` TICKET MACHINES `` , `` EXIT , `` and `` COUPON TICKET `` .
He is quiet and keep thinking ( is musing ) .
He needs to be in the security when these five people are around in society .
He seems to addict himselves with facts and information . information has no plural !
While he thinks more further about mysterios and his interest , . . .
. . . he will gather the knowledge .
Life will be devided into each part that let him feel safe when he separate people into various groups .
Although he does n't like exactly time frame activities and discipline . . . .
. . . he still want to know what people expect from his work or his leisure time . He will be in the position to provide a good plan .
He has a certain creativity and make good decisions .
but I just happened to discover Lang - 8 and I 've started ( using it ) .
Last Sunday I took an English ability test .
There were different kinds of questions to check writing skill , writing your opinion freely , summarizing the reading passage or summarizing the listening dialogue .
I was very bad at summarizing the listening part of the dialogue .
The result has not come yet , but it 's obvious . . .
We ca n't have a cat in the current apartment but my wife had one when she was in Kyushu .
The cat 's name is Rin and now she lives at my wife 's parents ' house .
She is afraid of everybody except my wife 's parents .
When we visited their house this August and said hello to Rin , She quickly climbed to the ceiling of the warehouse .
Today I was at my friend 's house all day .
I have a lot of job interviews this week , so I wrote some resumes .
In the evening , we went to a beef barbecue restaurant .
This is a photo of the barbecue .
I had a really good time .
Yesterday , I rode from the main campus to the medical college .
The roads are not flat , there are so many ups and downs .
When I got to my dorm , I was really exhausted .
After taking a warm bath I went straight to bed , and slept until noon .
It 's a rainy today .
My boyfriend has gone home for a week .
He never gave me a call .
I want to eat something delicious to release my anxiety .
First , I found a job .
This is a job in one not big shop of bathroom equipment , ceramics , baths , washbasins etc . . not big = small
I live in a small sceince center with a big number of institutes . science *
some time I will be working six day in a week but later this will be just five days and two off days . sometimes *
I feel not good now , but I am really glad that I have a job .
By the way , my affiliates are such nice people .
There 's a girl and a boy who is a little bit older than me .
My English is terrible , so enought . enough *
I was surprised when I suddenly accepted messages on a Japanese SNS from my junior high school friends who I had not seen for more than twenty years .
He gave me an email .
I sent emails to them .
However , no one did not remember me clearly .
We will have an alumni association of the track & field club in the next summer .
I usually study at a certain cafe & restrant which is called Saizeria .
I wanted to study there .
Also , I was in there ordering some food .
However , one staff told me ' do n't study here because we are busy ' .
I got out of there because it was uncomfortable .
I can study at home rather than the cafe .
This morning I have to sit with my little cousin , _ Dima .
He is so annoying ! _ Do n't think I am so evil , _ I do love children .
But he makes me angry .
Although he is already 3 years old , _ he cries like a new - born baby _ while his mum is out ! _ He not only cries , _ but even shouts .
He only cries and cries this word : _ `` MUM `` Omigod , _ soon I 'll go crazy .
My name is Wang Huan .
I am a junior student majoring in Japanese .
After graduating from high school in June , 2008 , I have studied Japanese for nearly two years since August , 2008 .
At present I am learning to use a computer by myself .
I can use the computer to deal with graph and data statistics and so on .
I was not good at communicating with people before , but while living at University as a class cadre my ability to communicate has increased .
I 'm frank and have the patience to deal with any matter . I also have a strong sense of responsibility .
Although I have not graduated yet , I have confidence in the future .
I will be well prepared to accept future challenge .
Finally , best wishes for my friends .
( I would like you to correct my errors )
I usually run to work , but I take the train to work on rainy days .
We had two days of rain , so I took the train both days .
Since I have to take two trains to work , and there is some lost time , it takes more time to go to work by train than by foot .
On the other hand , the advantage is that I can read books on the train .
Last weekend , I quarreled with my older brother .
I really , really hate my brother .
I could n't understand most words . . . .
I 'm not familiar with British sounds , but I was shocked at how little I knew !
Runnnig
I run near my house twice a week to keep fit .
I usually run about 6 kilometers .
I sometimes run up to 10 kilometers .
It takes about 40 minutes to run about 6 kilometers .
My pace is usually 6 minutes per 1 kilometer .
I run for my health so I never over do .
If I feel something bad , I run shorter than usual .
But I run at least 3 kilometers when I feel something bad .
If I feel good , I sometimes run much longer than usual .
Maybe I run about 10 kilometers when I feel good .
I found a mistake in my debit card history .
I shopped at the supermarket on a snowy day .
one class is ninety minutes , so I got exhausted .
We do n't pay tuition per class but stated cost in each university unlike universities in other countries .
I take as many classes as possible , because I have a voracious appetite for studying !
But , sometimes my fatigue beats my motivation > < Since I have been pressed for time because of heaps of assignments , I have been sleeping 5 hours on average recently .
In Japan , some students often sleep during a class at a university .
Self - introduction
Hi .
My name is Tatsuki Kaniwa .
I 'm 25 years old .
I 'm learning English seriously because my dream is to be a high school English teacher .
when I was a university student , my major was English literature .
after graduating from the university , I lived in Canada for a year to study English .
This May & nbsp ; I came back to Japan .
I & nbsp ; want to make a lot of friends , so please contact me .
Japanese like to read `` Manga `` .
Recently , I think that Japanese like to play a games too .
There are adults who play games in the train .
The other day , I saw a woman playing a game and walking in a busy street !
I like playing games too .
But we must choose the correct places to play a game .
I wonder what do foreigners think about this .
Since both my language exchanging partners , Zac and Mark are busy at school , I sometimes talk to them though , I think it is n't enough for me to speak English . I got it !
I 'm very tired .
Well , I 'm a sixteen year old girl .
So , I ca n't [ speak / write ] English very well .
That is me . Nice to meet you !
Today I went to high school .
I want my teacher to be interesting .
He was taking a holiday from the 18th of December to the 18th of January .
So we had a lesson with another teacher who is Ethiopian during his holiday .
We have had lessons from the Ethiopian more than the English teacher lately .
He questions us one by one , and we try to answer but some students can not answer .
When another student helps them , he says at once , `` I asked her , not you . ! ``
It ended with an unpleasant atmosphere .
After that we feared this time .
But , I 'm looking forword to my friends coming .
This weekend is going to end in 2 hours .
I have to go to sleep early today .
It was my birthday yesterday .
My friend told me that she wanted to give me a surprise .
She asked me my ex - boyfriend 's phone number .
I expected she would call him , because she knew I 'm missing him so bad .
But I suppose he does not miss me .
So I told the girl not to do anything .
I 'm waiting , just waiting .
It 's lover 's day .
I 'm living on a farm in Sussex , New Brunswick .
They have 5 cats , 5 horses , 4 cows , 3 dogs , 3 pigs , probably 20 laying hens and a vegetable garden !
It 's very calm and the air is clear .
There are many stars in the sky at night .
I did n't know we would be able to see them without a telescope .
Also I noticed my city is bright .
We 've forgotten that there are many stars in the sky .
When we notice we turn off the lights more often than before .
I knew , I liked nature and animals but I did not know , I would like farm life so much .
I was living in Tokyo , Japan before I ' came to Canada , on May 30th , 2011 .
because Tokyo is always busy and crowded .
I hoped I could have the chance to live in a rural place .
I was surprised when I found out about this website .
Of course , this is because the elderly have more money than the youngters .
In an aging society , the elderly are an important target market .
Saving money is considered as the bad circulation .
Ailing Japan sees a way out by attracting the aged .
I am planning to stay in Hong Kong for a month .
And I 've searched information about where to stay ( there ) .
In the place that I want to rent a house , the average price you buy a house for is about 350000 ( $ 5484 . 5 ) yuan per square meter and the average price you cost to rent a 60 square meter house is about 5000 yuan per month .
Consider if you are the house owner , the house will cost you 2100000 yuan .
If you let the house , you can get 60000 yuan per year .
That is to say , you money only grows at a rate of 2 . 86 % , while the current one - year deposit rate is 3 . 5 % .
With the fact that the prices of houses have stopped rising , why does n't the house owner sell the house and deposit the money into a bank or other investments ?
Is the housing price in Beijing too high ?
I would like to know the housing prices and rental price in your place , could you tell me ?
I could n't handle it well yet , but I felt the camera performed well .
The attached photo is a street scene at Stanford university .
I set the camera 's mode to Nostalgic Mode .
And find something interesting to take pictures of and post to my blog .
you ca n't buy a replacement for two years .
Some people also do the same plan , but the prices are different .
to be continued .
The new compact digital camera CX2 has been released by Ricoh .
This new camera a new function .
It can take photographs that look like miniatures .
The landscape looks like a toy landscape .
In the future , I think that the new compact digital cameras will have this feature .
The photograph below was taken with the new digital camera .
Does n't this landscape look like a toy lanscape ?
Lunchtime Trips !
My office is near a botanical garden .
Sometimes I go there to have lunch .
I usually buy breads and drink , and bring it there .
In the garden , there There is also a small restaurant in the garden .
Having lunch under cherry blossoms is a fantastic experience !
Moreover , a small mountain and a lake is also near my office .
It takes about 5 minutes by bicycle to go there .
There is also cafes by the lake .
Sometime , I take a hotdog and coffee .
Other times , I eat TAKOYAKI , which is a kind of snack that is famous in western area of Japan .
In spring , I can see the new branches of trees .
Having unch outdoors is very pleasant .
Today , I came here to improve my English writing skills .
Although I have studied English for many years , writing an essay is hard for me .
So I think writing once a day will help my English ability .
I have seen some other people 's diaries .
By the way , if you have any problems with Chinese , I can help you .
The male cats Kurochan and Dorachan drink the water in the bathtub .
A female cat Myuchan laps up the water from the edge of bathtub .
I like watching them lapping up the water .
It means the `` School is closed because of heavy snow `` .
However , they often called off school because of a typhoon .
My job situation is becoming busy again recently so I called a baby sitter today .
Today was ok , because I was able to be back at home earlier than I thought .
I could n't get back home before 9 pm for awhile and had to rely on baby sitter everyday .
And now , my job is becoming busy again ( even gradually ) and I 'm pretty sure that I 'll be much busier this summer .
But this is my way , I choose it by myself so I 'll never be able to give up .
This year I received two special tickets for people who live in Minato - ku .
So we could sit in front of the fireworks .
It was so beautiful and worth it to see it every year ! !
Of course , I was free therefore I was taken there .
It is the main place where mountain games will take place in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics .
Even the buildings in Whistler Village were beautiful .
It was like the Canada that I imaged before I came to Canada , or more .
I enjoyed it very much .
Today , I went to help with the delivery of furniture .
I got a huge mirror that was being disposed of . ( ? )
I placed the mirror on the back of my desk .
I like its size
Because the room appears larger because of the mirror effect .
Unfortunately , it 's too big for my desk .
I have to find a good way to put it up . . . . .
I think the earthquake will calm down if there are no more aftershocks .
But the nuclear plant accident is much too serious .
Japan has been devastated twice by atomic bombs .
However , now the Fukishima nuclear plant went bad .
I think maybe there will be after - the - fact reports .
The melt down has happened .
But we must solve it .
Today , I got my bonus .
I have some idea on how to spend the money .
But I ca n't decide what to spend it on .
I want to buy an ipod music player .
I want to take a flower essence seminar .
But it is an expensive seminar .
I like playing it .
I want to eat sushi until I get full .
It 's 5 am now , but I am still awake .
I ca n't sleep even though I have work today !
Hot soymilk usually helps me sleep , but the soymilk magic did n't work today .
I will be sleepy when I 'm leaving .
Could you tell me know how to sleep well ?
Now , I have to improve my English skill because it is essential for the college entrance examination .
The college that I want to enter demands a very flexible English skill .
But studying English for me is quiet hard so I can not write English sentences fluently .
By the way , I think it 's very silly to learn another language just for passing an exam .
I can share with you some Japanese things if you write a comment .
I will be glad if you will correct my sentences strictly , because I really want to write in English naturally .
A new semester !
Tomorrow a new semester will begin .
In a year and a half I will graduate from college .
I 've been studying to take the IELTS exam in May .
But one of my friends thinks I should take BEC first , and then finish the IELTS in July or August .
That 's because the BEC is good for job hunting .
Now I have no idea what should I do .
Can you give me some suggestions , my dear friends ? I am really confused now .
It was hard to set up before I could print out a page .
It took longer than I expected .
I used to use it easily .
Back then , it did n't take a long time before I could print it out .
It is ( or It 's ) hard to keep up with new technology .
Once it 's healed , I can play handball ! !
And I left hospital yesterday .
Accident
I fell ( off ) by bicycle on my way home .
I have never fallen ( off my ) scooter ( , so ) it ( had ) been a long time since I ( had last ) hurt myself .
How did the accident happen ? I was riding along a road but then the road disappeared so I had to go over to a carriageway . There was a small step , so I tried to step over it but I could n't since I was going kind of perpendicular to the road . Thus I ended up tumbling over it while I was still on the bicycle .
I grazed my knees and elbows and also had a few blue - black bruises .
( However , in ) some way , I think I was lucky ( ; it ) could be worse .
I am glad there was no cars coming from behind me .
I remember when I was little , I hurt myself in exactly the same way .
A bicycle is dangerous .
My bicycle 's handlebar bent , so I had to keep it ( diagonal ) to keep going straight .
The wound is not too bad ( , but ) I was a bit embarrassed .
Even the small steps scared me ( , even though ) I was riding very carefully .
It has been a long time since I last wrote an entry but now I 'm here again .
I stopped learning Korean a few weeks ago
These past days I realized that I should just focus on my English !
I 'm trying to figure out what 's wrong with my English .
For the past few weeks I have been frequenting a website called Omegle .
It 's a website that lets you talk to strangers at random .
It helps me understand what my current English level is .
I can not understand native English speakers yet .
I think they use a lot of slang in their conversations .
Do you think that talking to them could improve my English skills ?
So I know North Korea has been making nuclear weapon !
And I watched on TV that US journalists have been detained in North Korea .
Did n't they know the situation there ?
Journalists that go to dangerous places are so crazy , even though there is possibility of dying .
I respect them , but I will never go to war zone !
Will it be Korea or Japan ?
Or are they brave enough to attack the US directly ?
Anyway no country is interested in the Philippines , so . . . .
What a peaceful world we have here !
I heard that there are pirates in the Philippines , and that they kidnap people and kill them .
Maybe bandits too .
I think he lives in my house . . .
`` You have your whole life ahead of you ``
That is one person 's words I just got when I ask something about life a little while ago .
I sometime feel insecure about my ways if I should get things going or not .
I kind of hesitate .
In that time , someone gave me a supportive small push in right way .
I wish I could become like that someday .
I went to the library near my company 's office , during lunch time .
I read some magazines , which were about fashion , money , moter cycle and so on .
This library is the biggest in my city , with so many books in there .
I found this book on ' Amazon ' website , so I want to rent the book tomorrow .
Yesterday I met a friend who studies law at my university .
He called me on the phone when I was eating lunch on campus .
In the afternoon , we met at a cafe in front of S station near my university .
He seemed to want someone he could talk to without any constraint .
Law is not my field , but soon I realized I 'm interested in it , especially when he talked about the relationship between criminal law and psychiatry .
He looked like he was enjoying himself in talking about this matter .
It seems that high school was n't that long ago . Those happy moments occur to me all the time .
I was like , `` What if I could stay at that time forever ? `` But I know my mind now has changed a lot .
And I would n't have thought I would go this far .
All I 'm thinking now is how I can get a good , promising job , improve myself , socialize with other people and improve my English , especially spoken English .
And I think it 's been quite a long time since I 've posted any English article on this website , and it might be the best time for me to practice my second language by using Lang - 8 .
I will force myself to write something in English every day .
Thank you ! !
I 'm going to speak about myself in English at 10PM .
So , I will write what I 'm going to say .
I ran a full marathon two weeks ago .
It was n't the TOKYO marathon .
I have been talking with my friends on Skype lately .
I 'm really glad I joined this group .
I felt bad because I am not used to accepting expensive gifts from people .
In the morning and at night , twice !
I was really tired and fell down .
I remember my teacher told us this when I was a high school student , he said : `` Happiness is when you like your work . `` I did n't understand at that time .
I thought I would n't do anything if I disliked it .
As most Chinese students , I spent too much time to studying for the university entrance examination .
Luckily , I entered a good university and after graduation , I got a job in a company .
But the problem is , I do n't like my work .
I never tried to do anything besides learning for the exam .
I do n't even know what I really like .
So my coworker and I went to barraks to check two of the rooms .
It was horrible .
The filthy rooms are clean now .
It is hot in Japan today .
Very hot for me .
Today 's menu is fry minced meat with rice and sunny - side up !
As you know , the Bruins won the Stanley Cup this year !
The end of the parade route was in Copley Square , and I got to be there .
When I arrived at Copley , I 'd never seen such a tremendous amount of people there .
I thought all the people in Boston came downtown yesterday .
To make matters worse , the weather was so hot . . .
This was my first time watching a parade in Boston , and even though I 'm not a big ice - hockey fan , it was awesome .
I hope that the Red Sox will be the winner of the World Series , so then I 'll have a chance to watch a parade again !
Hi , my name is Norma .
I 'm learning English and Japanese .
I 'd like to improve my skills by using lang - 8 .
Maybe I 'll make mistakes for the first time ,
but if I try more and more ,
I 'll have good English . ^ ^
My first diary entry .
Hi , This is the first time I 'm writing a diary on lang - 8 .
I would like to improve my English for the future !
I have never studied history since junior high school .
I felt ashamed because I know less about Japanese history than my American friends .
I think that many young Japanese do n't know about their history .
We do n't know about own country 's and foreign countries ' .
Although it takes 5 hours to go / get to Hiroshima , I 'm very excited .
Eating Local Food
I 'm happy that I ate most of the things I tried in Amsterdam .
Yesterday I was given lots of emails by my friends and presents by my parents .
After that , I went to a cram school .
Since I had been so lazy these last few days , the class seemed to be difficult .
I can not wait for that .
I 'm starting Lang - 8 !
I 'm 25 and a medical student at 5th grade .
Does anybody know Tottori ?
Today I read a magazine in which Lang - 8 was introduced .
I want to improve my English , and I will start it today .
I do n't know how to use this .
It is so difficult that I 'm disappointed .
But to achive my dreams , I still have to study hard .
Today , when I was sleeping in the afternoon I had a bad dream .
It was very terrible .
I was so scared that it woke me up .
Happy Valentine 's Day
Travel plan going to the East coast
My plan is to go to the East coast ; because , I have never been there and the areas I want to visit are New York , Washington D .
C . and Florida .
I guess it would take more than a week if I will visit all the famous tourist spots in those areas and I 'm not sure whether I could take a vacation more than a week .
So , I might give up visiting some spots .
Anyway , I have to research how long I need to go around each location , I want to go and then decide the duration of the trip .
I met a lady who had something grey .
She told us if we touched it we would be happier .
So many people wanted to touch it , we even had to wait for a while .
There were about three hundred of people ( there waiting ) .
She made it using a towel which she bought at a one hundred yen shop .
Do you know what `` Unagi nobori `` means in Japanese ?
If you touch `` Unae , `` you will soon become lucky .
Actually , she has been lucky since she made `` Unae `` .
( because , ) she can meet many people and talk together .
If you want to know about `` Unae , `` please visit this site .
I heaved hero 's a duetI heard hero 's duet ? ? ? ?
The music is really fantastic !
This musical feels similar to the movie Moulin Rouge .
It was brilliant and sensational .
It 's a love story , during the war , between a hurted prostitute and a soldier who has to fight .
It ens in a tragedy with the heroines suicide .
Heart - stricken their love made me shed tears .
Today is rainy day so I spent it watching a movie .
What do you do on a day like this ?
I 'll want to clean my room after the movie ends .
I am going to spend my day at home .
Nowadays discipline from teachers to students in schools are said to have loosened up .
I escaped from the cold .
but now I have a headache .
and I took out some economic books from the library .
Tommorow I will have to study English and economics .
Would you please tell me what is the natural way to ask someone for a favor , especially when someone has a question , like what I am doing .
Checking a lot of forums about English usage , I noticed that many questioners add a thanks phrase at the end of their questions , like , `` Thanks in advance for your help , `` or just `` Thanks . `` Japanese usually do n't speak in this manner , but instead we use a different form of phrases to finish a request for a favor .
Thanks in advance for your help .
I took part in a job interview this morning , but after the HR kept asking me questions for about 30 minutes , she told me maybe this position does n't fit for me because I do n't have the SQL skill .
I was wondering why she did n't ask me if I have the SQL skill in the phone call last week .
I have two job interviews to go to tomorrow .
One is in the morning , and the other is in the afternoon .
I use the iPad for reading books and watching DVDs like FRIENDS .
I can also connect to the Internet anywhere and anytime .
But , it is a pity that the iPad is heavy for me .
I 'm looking forward and waiting for what the Apple will bring
This city is called ' Music city . ' I 'm talking about Nashville .
This is the Mecca of country music .
A lot of country music stars come from here .
I came here a few days ago , and I found this city is full of music .
For example , there are music boxes ( jukeboxes ) along the street ; and there are a lot of bars open at lunch time , and they have good live music .
I really want to go to the bars and listen to real country music , but I 'm ashamed to go inside by myself .
Before I leave here , I have to try .
I came here to learn English .
I 'm not sure how I can spend 3 more weeks here .
are getting better
I made a lighter really hot from the fire of the lighter and pressed the lighter on my skin to make a smiley face .
It hurt , but afterwards it was ok : )
My boyfriend told me about the smiley face , ( I did n't known about it before ) but he was worried about me when I did them .
So I will not do any new ones .
By the way , they dont look like smiley faces ,
I think it 's because I used a Japanese lighter
so they do n't smile ! : o
but I do n't mind ~
Anyways , I have not been studying English recently ,
I should ! ! ! !
A birthday party is going to be held in my son 's nursery school this Thursday .
I will go to the party and say a few words of celebration to him .
My hands are itching to write about this !
Everyone has a favorite animal and so do I .
My mother is allergic to cats so she is n't a ' ' cat person ' ' .
Although my mother did n't like cats , and still she does n't , she agreed with the idea to look after the cat for a few days .
I know it , my father has no sense of originality !
I was watching TV while drinking some hot chocolate , yumyumyum !
I heard some cracking sounds above my head .
Well , old houses sometimes make noise when you walk .
Cats always land on their feet , phew !
When I was taking the pieces of insulation material off her , I had to laugh about my clumsy cat !
I laughed and said : You 're a hairy , obese idiot !
My cat is n't the slimmest cat around ( She weighs 5 kilo 's o _ 0 ) , so the thin plates could n't support her weight .
( By the way , I did n't know what to call the ceiling .
I 'm sad because I continue to be terrible in English .
I always try to write something but I have difficulty because of I do n't have someone to correct me .
I 'm afraid to write something wrong in facebook and have people laugh .
English is not difficult but I continue to have a small vocabulary .
I took money from my pocket but it was 930 yen , so I was going to pay 110 yen from a my point card from this camera shop but I was short 10 yen , so I had to give up on buying one pack but I really wanted to buy one more .
All the workers were surprised that I found 100 yen .
I have 6 days left until my TOEFLiBT test . . .
I 'll be taking the test for the first time and this test is really important for me . . .
If I can get a certain score , I can go to america to study for a year using an exchange student program of my university .
But , it seems very difficult for me , so I am almost losing my confidence now . . .
It 's no use complaining now . . .
I should have studied harder during my winter holiday . ( > _ < )
This week , I remembered 60 new words
by studying the STEP pre - 1st grade .
I have enough time to write ( practice ? ) new words .
But I want to continue studying English every day .
Basically , the computer 's operation is CUI .
One of my dreams is to be the engeneer of Formula One .
However I have now lost assurance ( hope ? ) of it .
The teacher wanted to mark his students ' English compositions on the basis of the naturalness of their English , in order to evaluate how much they have used the language .
Happy day !
Today , my very funny class made me extremely happy .
In fact , they always make me happy .
One of my goals is to communicate with native English speakers without any obstacles .
So , please do n't hesitate to revise my poor English , even if it 's a tiny tiny mistake , misuse , or nuance problem .
I believe there are kind people in this online community and I hope they will help me improve my English skills . .
I 'm studying like this .
Today , I had a chance to speak English .
I think it is better to learn conversation and know our cultures than vocabulary learning .
So I want to watch movies but it ` s too expensive for me . . .
Today I thought about posting a video from a French movie , in which a scene takes place in Harlem .
So the protagonists speak English of course , and everybody can understand the video ; I do n't need to transcribe or to translate .
I 'll introduce the movie a little : The movie takes place in the 1980s ; it 's a French comedy as they were very popular in France .
The main character is played by Michel Colucci a . k . a Coluche , a very popular French comedian and actor .
In this movie , the protagonist ( Coluche ) works for an insurance society and has to travel around the world to bring back to France unlucky tourists who have unfortunately had problems or accidents .
Thus , in the movie , Coluche travels around the world , and experiences some adventures in various countries such as Morocco , The United - States ( Harlem ) , China and so on . . .
It 's one of my favorite French comedies ; I still laugh each time I watch it , even at this very moment writing the entry and listening to the excerpt at the same time .
I think it may be interesting to listen to the French accent and the ( maybe exaggerated ) view of Harlem by the French at the time .
The man says that New York is very dangerous and warns Coluche to be careful , especially of black people who attack whites .
Coluche , who was not afraid before he met the man , is now very tense and afraid . . .
And asks him to go to Harlem , but even the black taxi - driver refuses to go there and leaves him close to the district .
And the as the video begins we see him walking on the deserted streets of Harlem .
and is surprised to see that this same man is in bandages and apparently injured .
He asks him what happened , and the answer is that the man has been attacked ( if I remember correctly , I think that he was even attacked by white men . . .
Which is funny as he only warned about blacks ) .
I suppose it 's because I worked in the cold store yesterday .
When we have a cold , eating and sleeping well is the best for us .
My favourite season is summer , but not when it 's very hot .
Now in Russia it is summer and it 's awfully hot ! ! ! We go to the river almost every day , but even bathing does n't relieve me from the heat ! I never imagined that I would hope it would be winter now .
Winter I love too , but if you want to go for a walk in this season / winter , you have to to wear many / a lot of clothes ! ! Autumn . . .
I hate autumn ! It often rains , which is why you ca n't go for a walk .
Itis n't so hot , the grass and leaves are green , the birds are singing . . .
I 'm accustomed to summer 's heat and love it best of all !
I have to go to my office at the same time as usual after a heavy snowfall .
I also have to shovel snow around my house , car parks and office . . .
In addition to this , traffic is so crowded . . .
I just started this SNS .
I think this is good to improve my English skills .
I have been studying English for a few years , but my English writing and speaking is still not good , so I want to learn native English on Lang - 8 ( ^ _ ^ ) /
It 's the first sunny day in a while .
Sunshine makes me happy and gives me energy .
But a high humidity makes me feel heavy and steals my vitality .
I hope that fall in Japan will come as soon as possible !
I like going snowboarding during the winter , even though I 'm not very athletic .
I went snowboarding the past two Saturdays : - )
The final stage was so difficult that I triedhad to try it20 times in orderto solveit : - P But I have a lot of stages which is not solved , so I have to try them later .
Nagano , Japan
I would love to see a mountain .
I want to live in the countryside in the future .
Sometimes when I take a walk with my dog , I feel a sidewok is dangerous because of bicycles .
In Japan , we have the rule that defines a bicycle as a kind of car that has risk .
But some people who ride bicycles do n't know or understand its risk .
I sometimes watched on TV that there are roads for bicycles in Paris .
I hope that my city also prepares bicycle 's roads for safety .
After 10 days , we will take an exam about english .
It is very important and very famous if you do n't pass it , you wont get a suitable job in China .
It is for college students .
People who have already graduated can also take this exam , so that makes this exam more competitive .
But actually , people may have the ability to pass it , but they still ca n't communicate well in English .
I passed it half a year ago , but writing passages are still really hard . . .
Now , I can finally cook DAKDORI !
The whether was not very cold this morning , not like it typically is in Sweden .
Spring is comming !
Anyway , I had to cook lunch for the next 3 days .
I had some chiken and I wanted to cook Dakdori which I had attemted three times before and failed !
Fortunately , now I have a book which my mom sent me which is about Korean food .
Dakdori was just one the recipes included in the book under the chicken menu .
After 30 minutes my kitchen was a little dirty but the taste was fantastic !
I was very proud of myself .
Now I can show this to my friends who are eager to eat korean food .
hahaha
I have to go to the office right now !
I overslept .
I work hard every day .
I am really looking forward to it .
Once or twice a year our club plays matches against other senior soccer teams . or another senior soccer team
We also help each other in both our public and private lives .
my name 's Abdo . I 'm forty years old and I am new here .
I want to make friends .
There were two types of foreigners who were in Japan before the earthquake happened .
Some foreigners in Japan went back to their home countries .
However , it is found that Tokyo may be a safe area this week , so they are trying to come back to Japan .
I hear that when they come back to Japan , they will have problems .
Other workers in their company who did not leave and continued to work may be angry .
In fact , they imposed their work on other workers , but I think safety is the most important thing and they should be welcomed back to their company .
A random thought on ( or : about ) energy
While I was researching alternative energy for a five minutes speech , a thought occurred to me .
It is necessary that we develop alternative energy .
In capitalism , it is inevitable that alternative energy will be used for profits
I think what we need now is not to generate more energy , but to consume less energy .
In modern society , especially in urban life , we have become too dependant on energy .
For example , when I come home after work , I use water and gas energy to take a shower .
I surf the internet with an air - conditioner and a fan turned on . After surfing the web I watch TV with the desk - top still on and use a stove and microwave to have a meal .
Before going to bed , I usually read a book listening to music , unless I go to the pub .
I went through a blackout once during my stay in the Philippines .
I realized then how much I depend on energy .
Darkness made me a fool who could n't do anything at all .
I was just sitting in front of my laptop in darkness
Next thing I know , it was nighttime .
So I went outside
I could n't do anything .
electronic devices that had n't been recharged were useless such as a laptop , tv , mp3 player , even the refrigerator .
All I could do was drink beer going stale in the refrigerator .
Fossil fuel is limited
Therefore , we will develop alternative energy someday .
But the energy itself will be merely a commodity . To be bought or sold in capitalism .
We also made carbondyxide a commodity . We even buy and sell the right of emission .
I think it 's impossible for sustainable development to be realized .
The concept of sustainable development must have been made by capitalists who wanted to legitamize development and exploitation .
There is alreeady enough development and exploitation .
Unless we do , we will be attacked by nature with climate change
Because the airplane was so early , I fall asleep while the plane was flying .
When I woke up , I heard a sound like glasses falling to the floor .
I realized that it was my glasses , but I could not see where they were after reaching around for a while .
although I even did not know him
He was very friendly and helped me find them ,
then I noticed he looked like a gentleman who was full of understanding ,
the same age as me , and also wearing glasses .
After chatting for a while , we seemed to have a good impression of each other , because we enjoyed our talking and we had a really nice time . I think we will be close friends for life .
I think the oil spill accident in the gulf of mexico is a very important thing in the world .
Depending on a case , I think it is more important than economic problems , religion , war , poverty , or any other problem .
Because It affects the whole world , nobody knows a solution , and nobody can predict what will happen .
But we hardly hear the news about accident on TV in Japan .
Do you guys really speak like that ! ?
`` West of the mountains are broad and fairly flat plains . ``
I can understand its meaning , but is it awkward for the English reader or listener ?
English Again !
After an English lecture , I tell myself over and over again : I must learn English now !
It looks really nice here .
I have sent many messages to strangers who speak English .
I hope they 'll reply .
I hate English , because I have studied it for eight years , but I ca n't listen to a lecture well , and I ca n't read an English paper well either .
I really need this website to improve my work .
So I hope English speakers will become my friends .
So I think it 's memorable to keep something down here . ( unclear )
I have to admit age is a becoming more and more a sensitive issue as I get older and older , and the older I get , the more responsibility comes along and the more mature you should behave .
Well , I think I wish I could welcome the moment at home as usual , but I failed for the last couple of days which flashed through so quickly in a northern city I have never been to before .
Travelling makes the time elapse so quickly that I have hardly any time to digest the change of age satisfactorily , Even though I have been able to come back home this morning , I still ca n't take my time and am actually struggling to keep awake to digest it as much as I can , because I hardly slept yesterday .
Do n't tell others , okay ?
- Daikon - Oroshi is grated Japanese ( white ) radish .
He got angry and swung his kitchen knife ( at her ) , but his daughter resisted / blocked with her cane and escaped .
And then the police caught him in the act .
He said `` My daughter ate my Daikon - Oroshi from the refrigerator without my permission , so I got upset ,
I did n't really / actually intend to kill her . It was just a threat . . . ``
My new friends who come from USA .
I was suppose to very nervous , because my English is n't well , I was afraid that I could n't express my English well .
That 's right . I should be about to break through myself .
Today is my holiday .
Japan has a holiday called `` Bon vacation `` .
Do you know what is Bon vacation ?
Most of the people are on holiday during Bon vacation .
Bon vacation is the day of worshiping our ancestor .
But I was on duty during the Bon vacation .
Therefore I took today off as an alternative to Bon vacation .
Our company is all about trading .
There are many things we export , especially foods .
My boss went off the company property at one moment .
I got really hungry .
I want to have a banana .
In the picture shown above .
It is a sample that we sell .
But it looks really nice and smells good .
My boss always tell us , do n't eat the samples because he has to use it for show .
But I ca n't be patient .
When I first had spaghetti in the UK , I found it terrible .
It was boiled for too long and too soft for me .
Moreover , I still did n't like it when I bought a can of spaghetti ( canned spaghetti ) and had it because it was like jelly , and was essentially just a can of meat sauce .
In the far eastern country Japan , we did n't know al dente in the past .
We have traditional noodles , Udon and Soba , which are basically boiled to their core .
However , we now know that it 's far better to have spaghetti in that way .
Why is n't al dente that common in this European country whose people are the most omnivorous ?
twitter
I made a twitter account .
@ shiny7093
Eastern Monkey .
I think I understand their values , but it looks like they do n't understand mine .
I know it 's really just a small thing , but I feel like this tiny gap definitely exists .
As you may know , I 'm the kind of person who is so ' easy ' .
Being easy is a good point , but it make me wanna die .
I do n't know how to escape from this guy I have lived as for 22 years .
The thing I really hate is having a predictable future .
There is no option , I have to use this chance .
I can stay here only 3 more months .
How can I understand it ? Give me more information .
Korea has a very tragic modern history .
The capitalist side and the communist side broke out into war .
Today , I found this news article .
North Korea began a large construction project in Pyongyang .
I do n't understand how they can do
I am writing a paper , could you please help me correct it ?
Thank you !
Instead of replying each , I ( will ) thank you all for correcting this diary .
I have mid - term exams soon .
I have to remember a lot of names of drugs for
and the class is taught in English .
Japan has a big problem since we / it had a big earthquake ,
so I have to endure many things because many people suffer .
I feel that spring has arrived here overnight , for the simple reason that the temperature in recent days has risen to 20 degree during the day .
however , there was heavy snow on the12th of April last year and the snow remained until the end of that month .
but so far , there is only a little part of snow left in the corner , where it is sheltered from the sun shining directly on it during the day .
According to the locals , they have even experienced snow in May when they were younger .
now the weather is becoming more and more extreme .
I bought a new laptop today because my PC broke .
because my old PC broke .
I will take an English lesson on Skype this weekend .
But just now I tried to hear my voice on Skype , and it sounded bad .
I 'm worried if I can take the lesson smoothly this weekend .
I want to write my profile first .
I listen to [ the Gazette ] and [ Kalafina ] .
And I like Lolita fashion !
Thank you for reading !
The primary reason that I watched this movie because I just wanted to relax for a little bit after I knew we still could n't get the annual bonus again this year .
Plus , the movie scenes could n't be better .
This movie is talking about two different American girls who spent their summer in Barcelona , where they have a romantic , unforgettable adventure .
Meanwhile , they are still learning how to face some issues in their lives .
This movie 's spirit seems give us the idea that everything is possible , especially relating to love .
When it comes to the subject of love , some people tend to be realistic , some people are always expecting something very different .
I can understand how it feels when people want to chase , and find something in their life , but do n't know what exactly is the purpose .
Therefore , whatever what kind of life we want , it 's our choice .
But I think most people in our country , we do n't have enough courage to change the situation , or sometimes we just carry more moral responsibility .
Our space was near the sea and the station , and when I arrived , there were some friends .
( While we waited for the start of the fireworks show , we ate and drank . would be more natural . )
We had been tired , but when we watched them , we forgot our fatigue .
The fireworks were the most beautiful which I had watched ever .
Please watch them with my pictures ^ ^ In fact , they were more beautiful ! !
Also , I wore a yukata for a long time so I was happy .
I 'll talk about what is fun .
It is fun to watch my favorite TV programs .
So when I come home about all programs I want to watch have already finished .
So , I record programs to my Blu - ray disk .
In the following days I 'll write about my favorite programs .
Some university students find they benefit from part - time work while others say that working even part - time would prevent them from making the most of their studies . Discuss the merits of both arguments . With which point of view do you agree with in regard to your country and why ?
Some students need to find jobs for living , but others have a choice if they work or not for extra money .
Also some of them say work would be an obstacle for their study .
But I agree with that students do part - time work even in Japan .
So they do not need to work , though they still need some extra money for clothes , dating and so on .
I think there are few students who work for living costs like food , rent , utility bills .
Thats why it seems like an unnecessary experience .
Cooperation skills are very important , so if they wo n't do any job while they are student , after graduation they may face some difficulty such related with social and coping skills in the future .
Also they would know how time is precious and enhance their time management skills .
In conclusion , part - time jobs are beneficial but students should n't spend too much time for a little extra money .
I heard news that one of the oldest and most famous restaurants in Rome was punished with suspention of their business operation because they dishonestly charged a Japanese couple about 700 Euros for lunch .
They could not speak Italian or English , so their Japanese hotel owner went to the police station with them to claim the money back .
I was surprised that they had paid with their credit card !
If I were them , I would make a complaint in English anyway .
But they might have threatened me or pretended to not understand English . . . .
What could I do ? ? ?
P ' Pun suggested this site to me and I really appreciate him . .
haha hope he does n't see this .
there are some things that we need to remember , while there are some things that we need to forget , andhad better not remember again .
I 'm trying to forget somebody who was just a guest in my life , they just lived in my past life .
they will not come again .
tears can get people 's sympathy , andcan make me feel good , but I do n't like it .
tears show that I am weak , I amnever willing for other people to see me crying .
the memory of these unhappy things will disappear with time .
It 's May now , but it is too hot .
Today , we had a VERY long meeting . . .
It was over 2 hours , and it was so boring that many of us slept : - P
After that , I tried to fix a bug on my software .
I had googled for 3 or 4 hours and finally I found a solution and fixed the bug ! !
It seems that there is no information in Japanese about the bug , so if I have time , I will write an article about that .
We live our everyday lives using clocks .
We use them when we get up in the morning , go to work , to go back home , and go to bed at night .
But I often dream of a life without clocks .
I think that it might be a richer kind of life . ( ? )
My boss goes on a official tour today .
So
I am free in the morining .
But the test is next week .
By the way , Is there the drill for earthquakes ?
, Earthquakedrills happen more than firedrills in Japan , because Japan has many earhquakes .
There is an expression in Japanese .
`` earthquakes , thunder , fires , fathers ``
These are all scary .
If there are mistakes in my sentences , please tell me .
According to the weather forecast it 's going to snow tomorrow .
I think winter is surely coming soon .
I 'm planning to go to Sapporo ( the capital of Hokkaido , Japan ) this weekend and I feel uneasy about going through the pass because it 's very dangerous to drive on icy roads .
Actually , I 've never gone through the pass during this time of the year .
I hope that nothing bad will happen .
The third and fourth grade classes were suspended as well as the first grade class .
Thank you for reading and for your corrections .
Most Japanese people are changing their clothing for the season in Octorber .
I want to eat some sort of Japanese stew when it gets cold .
I made `` ODEN `` a few days ago .
ODEN is a famous Japanese stew in winter .
I love it , because my body becomes warm and healthy .
Would you tell me what foods you eat on cold days in your country ?
I 'm angry with my father ! !
I made some mistakes but everyone except for my father said it was good .
Everyone was very ( kind .
My father , however , said `` Oh , this mochi is really hard like a stone . `` as soon as he ate it .
While I cooked , he was just sleeping .
He should have helped or just said nothing .
Since Friday , whenever I turned on A / C , a weird and loud noise comes from the front part of the car , where the engine is located .
But , I still could hear very a interrupting and worrying noise from A / C .
Tomorrow is Sunday , so I do n't think they will be open .
I hope it wo n't cost me a lot .
I will post a picture of Spot tomorrow with some writing . Right now , I 'm so tired and want to go sleep .
I feel so tried . I had to finish my homework , but I think I will be able to finish my homework by the end of this holiday .
However , my parents do n't agree . They think I will spend my time learning somethings else .
So much work . I can I finish it all .
I have decided to go on a diet .
I went to Guangzhou a few days ago , and introduced some kinds of dimsum to a Shanghai friend .
She loved it so much .
My favorite kind of dim sum is liusha bao cold cake , and chicken feet !
= ) You should try some Cantonese dim sum IF you go to Guangdong .
Maybe try others if you do n't dare to try chicken feet !
I wanted to be friends ( with her ) , but I could n't .
I was shy and could n't find a reason to talk with her .
My boyfriend and I are going to a shrine to pray for our health for this year .
We are spending a very relaxing time on our holiday .
I wish I can take good care of our family financial management .
I get a part of our savings to invest in the stock market .
So , if I have free times I concern stock market information .
Whenever I think about job - hunting , I feel soooo anxious .
I want to be a child forever . . .
Is this Peter Pan syndrome ?
I think the definition of an adult is different throughout the world .
But maybe there are many countries that define `` adult `` at an earlier age .
I 'm 18 years old , so I could be considered an adult in another country .
My complexion is getting better compared to other seasons .
That is mosquitoes .
Dear mosquitoes , do you really think my blood is more yummy than others ?
I 'm already getting a great deal of mosquito bites .
I even dreamed that mosquitoes attacked me seriously like in `` the Birds `` by Hitchcock .
I am going to do something about it .
I do n't like to be a powerless victim for the mosquitoes .
I 'm wrestling with the ideas on how to protect myself from them .
Basically , it is said Japanese people are not good at speaking English .
We begin to learn it in junior high scool .
If we go to university , we are learning English for10 years .

Unfortunately I could not do it during the new year 's celebrations with my friends because of my illness .
But now , after the exams I must have some fresh highland air .
There is a ski resort in my town , but to my regret I only got to know about it at last year .
Over there snowboard is the most Popular , but I did not chose it for this reason .
I have experienced many years in skiing , but I never snowboarded .
Well , I will wait for the end of this month and for good weather now .
The best traditional peruvian food of all the places I 've eaten at !
It 's located at 1062 San Martin Avenue , Pueblo Libre .
In particular , they have a good variety of great food , a big menu of traditional dishes such as papa rellena , ceviche , butifarra . One of the most famous is `` choritos a la chalaca `` .
The whole place is an old colonial building !
I think it 's one of the only places in the capital city that maintains these traditions .
Inside of the restaurant , you will see many pictures from the time when this place was under construction , pictures of our first monorail , the first cars in peru , etc .
The waiters are a bit old , but they are really good .
I feel very pleasant every time I go there . You find out about not only our food but also a little bit about our history !
And there are a lot of foreigners going there as well .
The price is quite normal and I find it reasonable since they cook very well . .
I would like to recommend this restaurant to all the tourists who are coming to visit Peru . If you plan to fill your stomach with something tradtional , fast , unique and good from an ancient place like this , do n't hesistate and go find it out for yourself .
I 'm writting my first post , and I need to your help to explore my English .
My friend Rafael , said in one of his last posts , that he canonly study in a perfect notebook .
He 's a very funny guy , and I meet him when we wereonly five years old .
Until the start of this year , he was my classmate , and he suggested this website to me .
In my point of view , it 's a complicate website , but I think if I practice , I can use so goos this site , and finally reach my objective .
I 'll appreciate thosewho correct my text , and thanksssss ( a lot of `` S `` it 's a internet form or expression that we use a lot on MSN , here in Brasil )
I sped up on the road trying to catch up to my friend 's car .
I did not see that a police car was behind me .
I realized that was why everyone was driving so slow .
I especially like watching European soccer !
He Defeated a Bully
When some bullies walked up to him to bully him yesterday , he suddenly defeated the boss of them with a punch to his stomach .
Honestly , I was glad to hear this from my son , and I am proud of him .
I think that my son will have a more peaceful school life for a while .
Nowadays I think about a lot of things .
Maybe the final test is coming soon .
I took a ride on his motorcycle .
He took me many places that I 've never been .
Riding a motorcycle was not as scary as I thought it would be .
I heard he has n't got a girlfriend .
Today I will meet my friends who study with me at university .
We will meet at 6 PM .
M and drink some liquor .
I do n't think I 'll return home today .
I like to take home sick kittens to treat their illnesses .
Most kittens are really sick and die a few days later .
My cat is the only kitten that has grown to adulthood .
I wanted to adopt him , but I do n't have enough space for two cats .
I bathed him everyday because he had a thick layer of fleas .
After a few days , his eyes were getting better , but he was still thin .
This afternoon , when I checked on how he was doing , his box was empty .
The housemaid said that he went to the veranda , jumped from the second floor , and escaped through the front gate .
It seems like summer is back .
The temperature in the daytime is over 30 degrees .
However , it is cooler in the morning and evening with a pleasant autumn breeze .
We also feel a pleasant breeze in the shade , even in the daytime .
During the cycling trip , I stopped at a local public facility
where many trekkers were resting .
I wondered why so many people were walking there so I asked one of them .
She told me that this facility was one of the checkpoints of the Oxfam Trailwalk .
Actually , the checkpoint I saw yesterday was the one for 80 km .
She said that they were walking another 20 km for the rest of the day .
This event is also a fund - raising event .
as they might fear the nuclear crisis and aftershocks of the 3 . 11 earthquake .
Some wore T - shirts on which encouraging messages for Japan were written .
This is the fourth time for her to participate in the Olympics .
She was placed 7th in her first Olympic in Nagano , Japan , 6th in Salt Lake City , USA and 5th in Torino , Italy .
This time , she had performed better than she had been and the other players , but she was placed only 4th .
I was hoping this time she could win a medal . .
After her run , she said `` I failed to get a medal but I did try my best . ``
That made me think that I should support her ever though I am not sure if she will continue with mogul .
Anywany , I think it 's going to be one exciting Olympic .
If you want to learn Japanese , I 'd be willing to help as much as possible .
I enjoy the school festival from October 9th to 11th .
There was a concert , and I played the Trombone .
Many people came to watch our concert , so I was very happy .
I think I will work very hard to prepare for the next concert .
This time I wrote easy and short sentence .
I will write longer and more difficult sentences next time .
Today I had an English meeting with three representatives of our company , and customers .
I met three colleagues at the Tokyo station , then headed to Utsunomiya station where we were going to meet them .
I was a little nervous yesterday , so I called my mom to ask her ( about ) the points I have to keep in mind for the business meeting in English .
Most Japanese do n't understand the basic concept of `` shaking hands , `` She said .
A huge earthquake and tsunami hit my prefecture
I could not believe my eyes when I saw it on TV .
I live in Thailand now ,
So it is difficult to get precise information .
I went for a drink with my colleague and saw the BBC program .
I saw , an atrocious scene .
A large amount of cars , houses , and people were floating .
Walls and billboards had fell .
The worst thing is , the focus of the earthquake was near my house .
My mother and sister still live there .
And apart from them , my father and younger brother also are in the prefecture .
Therefore , I tried to call them with my cellphone ,
I was so worried about them .
I could not stop searching the internet for any information .
Using sites like ustream , twitter , and facebook .
She said that they were all safe and are staying at home together now .
I felt a little relieved .
Nuclear damage is so terrible .
All I can do is to pray for their safety .
Today I got a phone call from Mrs . Huang asking me to interview with her company .
It 's the third call so far , but I did n't go . ( yet ? )
Sometimes I regret my decision , but I have no way because of my studies .
I did n't prepare for it entirely .
I do n't know how to dress for an interview , how to deal with one , and how to answer hard questions .
Now I 'm confused .
I ` m a college student and I live in a dormitory .
The dormitory has a curfew .
So even If I ` m hungry , I ca n't go to a supermarket to buy food when it is past curfew .
However , I ` m hungry now .
We went tobogganing down a hill in my neighborhood .
It was my first time doing it , although I have skied and snowboarded .
It was so scary !
At first I brushed it off and thought it is was a sport for kids .
It is like a roller coaster .
The farther we went , the faster we went .
The speed was outrageous .
Besides that , I could n't control it well .
I actually struck a child .
Fortunately she was n't hurt , but my mind went blank at that moment .
I admired the children because they had no fear .
I guess there are a lot of opportunities to toboggan here and I have to improve my skills so as not to be beaten by children .
I got pretty / fairly drunk .
I will go to sleep early today .
It is far more difficult than we think to behave that way .
Because a relationship requires cooperation , listening to each other is very important .
This also applies to daily conversations .
It was n't finish . It did n't finish .
I 'll try next day . I 'll try tomorrow .
hey ~ hello : D
this is anne who keeps listening to 575 by perfume ( japanese artist ) these days .
first I went to Village Vanguard which is a bookstore .
this is one of the most kawaii and useful bookstores I 've ever been to .
and I had a banana tart with cream and a cup of soy latte .
I wish that place was a non - smoking place and
I wish I could stay a little bit longer .
( you have to order more if you want to stay there for over 2 hours . . . )
and this is a kind of a book cafe so
so there are many books
I read the book about movie quotes ( interesting )
amaaaaazinnng and it made me cry .
this is me and this is a day of an otaku - girl .
As you know , the economy situation is getting worse , especially the car industry including US and Korea .
I have to save money if I wanna buy a car . . . ^ ^
I 'm happy to know about this site .
I 'll try to write a diary and correct someone 's diary everyday .
I am testing whether or not Lang - 8 has really become faster after its maintenance and I think it is working just fine .
Access speed is very critical for an SNS and I really appreciate the effort which the staff has made so far .
Now I can keep up on my language practices .
I thought that creating proxies was difficult .
But today , I wrote one .
It was piece of cake .
but using that code , I can access that URL .
That mechanism is , When I access `` URL `` , proxy response `` URL `` .
normally , Ajax can not cross site .
but , but using this mechanism , perhaps , I can do it .
Hello , I 'm new here .
But then I realized it was an interesting one ; therefore , I have registered here .
People say I 'm making big progress , but I do n't think so ,
because my spoken English is still poor .
I often talk to native speakers , but actually , I do n't understand them too much .
Yesterday , the rainy season began at Kyusyu district , which is located in the southwestern part of Japan .
It will begin in all parts of the country during the next few days .
I do n't like this season because it is difficult to go out on a rainy day .
But you can see beautiful hydrangea during the rainy season in Japan .
My hair is parted on the left side .
When I put down my hair , it is long enough to reach my middle back .
I am planning to grow it longer ; to my lower back .
I used to wear bangs . ( Or have bangs )
Since I was told to reveal my forehead to have better luck , I grew the front hair out and pulled it to the side .
The shop always has flower ( s ) in a big vase .
Today 's flower is called `` fox face `` .
My friend is a teacher at a junior college .
She said , `` What do you think ? ``
I thought about it a little bit , and I answered ,
She smiled in agreement , and sipped hot coffee .
I 'm not going to school
because of the school opening ceremony
I am going to go to the library and study hard
and go to academy ( academy ? )
Today is a holiday .
I was very sick last / on Thursday .
But I did not go to the hospital , because I was busy .
I felt really bad .
I feel so good .
Yesterday was my friend 's birthday .
I bought her a clock and a hairdryer .
I drove to the party .
We are at the party .
I could n't go to Akita to enjoy it / the festival but I watched it on TV .
I have never seen the fireworks neither on TV nor real one / live .
Because they are so beautiful with beautiful music .
In the train , a high school student sat down on a chair .
In front of him an elderly woman appeared .
He said to her ' Sit down , please . '
But she declined that proposal so he felt embarassed and pity for asking .
A week later , ahead of an elderly man , the student sat down without saying anything .
What would you do ( can do n't need ) if you were the student ?
But you should know there are people who do n't want to be asked .
Women Love Talking .
My friend and I were going to do homework after classe .
We were doing the homework at the good pace .
But then we started talking about our high school days to refresh ourselves because we were tired .
We had no time to do the homework , so we each went home .
It is very fun for me to talk with my friends .
Probably , most women like it .
I 'm a Japanese .
I like my cat .
Her name is Karupin .
She wakes up me at seven everyday .
But we sleep together .
It 's very cute and I feel relaxed .
Today , I worked as intern at a small venture company .
In this company , there are only four people and some intern students including me .
This company deals with some IT - like business .
And today after working I had dinner with my acquaintance , a person who is working in the famous consulting company accenture .
He was also born in Kansai area , I mean Osaka , so the tempo we spoke at matched .
The topic of my experiences on my trip to the Philippines that I had this August came up in conversation .
I had traveled alone to thoroughly observe the different culture and study English , and my trial resulted in success .
I had a precious experience .
And as I talked about it , I do n't know why , but I noticed tears in my eyes .
This is probably because of the experience I had there , that is what I saw in the slums and people in poverty and what I felt was unreasonable .
I remember thinking that I want to heartily changed this situation , to help people who naturally did n't do anything wrong .
I thought again about what I should do .
I asked to myself again in my mind , but I still have no answer .
From the angle where I was seated , I could see Yossy and behind her , through the window , the gloomy , stormy weather in Tokyo ; I could n't hear any sounds of the rain or thunder .
If you had stood next to the sliding door of the room hearing what was being talked inside , you might have heard intermittent laughing sounds made by a female ( 1 only ? ) , and monotonous , enthusiastic talks by a male ( 1 only ? ) , which might have gave you an impression ; the atmosphere was not too bad , or too good either .
It has been about 2 weeks since I have joined this site .
Surely , I have gotten many friends that really want to help me .
However , I only found one friend on this site who was really kind and concerned .
She is Laura , also called Amaya , .
She is from the US .
She always helps me on every journal that I have written .
She also corrects me .
I 'm proud of her because even though she is busy working and studying .
She still finds time to help me .
So , I would like to thank Amaya for her help and advice .
I hope she will achieve her dream of studying in Japan .
On birthdays , families gather and wish each other well .
I feel pleased . I feel happy .
I hope we will continue to be a peaceful family in the future .
I have practical training for three days , and the company 's dorm has wireless internet .
I ca n't surf the internet on the first day so I am very sad because I surf the internet almost every day .
But today , I can surf the internet . I am very glad so I like the company more than before !
Recently , a high - speed train accident occurred in China .
I 've met some calm and gentle people from China to talk to with this site .
Of course , not everyone is like this .
I still want to see the world and communicate with many people .
Hi , I 'm Caronte751 and this is my first post on this site ,
I 'd like to improve my English by writing some stories or paragraphs
I hope to do the same for you .
At that time I did n't know how to eat it , so I poured milk over it , which did n't taste very good .
In Tokyo I found muesli in a grocery store .
I saw how to make it soft by soaking it for several hours in yogurt .
It seemed like a good idea .
I bought a package of muesli , mixed it with yogurt and put it in my refrigerator at night before going to bed .
The next morning , I had it with jam .
It was so delicious that I want to have it more often .
I will have fun . It will be fun .
I Think of Myself on Quick Sand
We no longer have a lifetime employment system sice the late 80 's .
Instead , I 've watched company harassment like `` you 're incompetent ! `` or `` we ca n't afford to pay you `` in order to force them into early retirement
After introducing the performance system to mimic the US , teamwork does not work and we think of co - workers as enemies .
We used to be happy and energetic even if we had a hard time during a
We , however , exploit temporary staff and live in a dog - eat - dog world .
We bully weaker employees and they bully the weakest .
Luckily I have a job and a dependable income .
But , I feel helpless
sometimes when my colleagues leave the office .
I 've just remembered I knew `` xxx `` has `` that `` meaning when everyone told me , and I do n't want to mislead you guys with my name any more !
My cute `` My Little Pony `` should not connected to such a nasty word .
lololol No , they should not . . . . . . . . .
We just know `` Kiss Kiss Kiss `` , that is why you can see cute and classy Japanese girls have usernames include `` xxx `` on twitter !
Believe itor not , we just think `` xxx `` looks `` Kawaii `` .
I chose `` Chloe `` for my new name because my real name starts `` C `` also .
: - ) I think `` Cindy `` is agood one , too .
My deepest condolences to the earthquake victims .
I 'm pretty sad about the earthquake that happened in Japan a few days ago .
Good luck to all the people that live in Japan !
My company 's office hours are supposed to be from 10 : 00 to 7 : 00pm .
But , nobody leaves the office at 7 : 00 .
My coworkers all work until late at night .
I do n't know exactly what time they go home because I 'm one of the first three people to leave the office .
I usually leave the office around 7 : 30 .
I want to finish my job at exactly 7 : 00 and enjoy my private life .
But It 's awkward to leave office at 7 while others are working silently . . .
I 'm not that confident about getting a high score , but I 'll try my best .
One of my friends on skype told me that all you have to do is concentrate on the exam and relax .
Certainly , it is necessary to relax to get a high score .
Since I 've written some journals about TOEIC , you might have guessed that I risk my life for it , but that 's not true .
Well , studying business English is bloody boring .
I do n't think that much business English is needed to communicate with foreign people .
what should I write to my pen pals about ?
if everything would be so easy then I could just start writing right now . . .
it 's a big `` dilemma `` .
can you recommend something to me ?
Two weeks ago I bought a new portable DVD player that is region free at an online shop .
Although I like it , I have found that some DVDs do not work .
I have lots of American DVDs whose region code is 1 in my house .
When I tried to find out why I can not watch some of them , I discovered there are the region code of some DVDs that could not be recognize with a region free DVD player .
That is why some my DVDs do n't work with my DVD player .
So , I am thinking when I go to America next time , I will buy a portable region 1 DVD player .
I think if I bought it , since all my DVDs are region code 1 , I could watch all of them .
Although I have to hang on until I go to America again , I think it is a good idea .
I hope I will be able to buy a good one at a good price .
I strained my back when I tried to lift a stack of 24 DVDs .
It 's too heavy for me ?
Here 's my last question ^ ^ lol
When I speak English , although it is n't in a perfect sentence , a native speaker can usually understand what I mean .
But , I always wonder if my English is right .
See , I have never visited a foreign country .
As an English - language learner , it is definitely necessary to go to abroad but I do n't have enough money .
I heard that Sookmyung University 's TESOL course is linked to a foreign university , so after I finish the course I hope to study abroad at a foreign university .
As an English - language learner , I feel that the English education in Korea has not been effective .
Through the TESOL course , I hope to improve myself as a qualified English teacher .
After finish the course , I will practice what I have learned in preparation to teach Kindergarten and if the chance comes to me I hope to go to graduate school .
However , the interface is not as sophisticated as that of iPhone .
Moreover , the display speed was very slow . So I felt slightly impatient .
Amazon should design Kindle to show the progress status clearly , as it takes several seconds to finish some operation .
I have been gluttonous recently . . . .
I had dinner the day before but I ate two more hamburgers late at night after dinner
I was hungry soon after eating . . .
Why is this so ? ? ?
( Good ) Morning !
I found Mr . hou8592984 's blog .
His Chinese fairytales are so fantastic !
What do you think about lying ?
Some people say that it 's not good to tell a lie even if you have a reason to do it , while others say that some times we need to lie to make people feel better .
What do you think about it ?
In order to continute to write English , I should decide a theme .
Theme : Depression
Reasons : Now my husband is working ( for schools ) as a Japanese teacher .
By writing his depression journal , I would like depressive patients and their families to know about this disease / illness and surely believe in his or her recovery .
( This is possibly due to my little reading experience , my being lazy and ignorant . ) I certainly enjoyed reading it in the original a couple of years ago , and for that now I probably do n't need the dictionary anymore .
Now I 'm staying in / at my aunt 's house .
Every time I go on a trip , I visit here .
There are five people here ; My uncle and aunt , grandmother , a male cousin , and a cousin , who is a single mother and has a baby .
I did not drink alcohol in a couple of days .
I have been a very good girl .
I did n't drink yesterday too .
I have to teach a dance class every thursday . ( yesterday was thursday )
I was rushing to go to the dance studio .
I was late leaving my place .
I ran to the train station and when I was on the train I found out
that I was wearing two different shoes on my feet . . .
Those shoes had different colors and shapes .
I really wanted to go back to change them , but I did 't have time to .
so I stayed on the train wearing two different shoes .
I was standing on one foot on the train .
when I got to the studio , everybody laughed at me so hard .
I was dying of laughter .
This past couple of weeks , I 've been very busy .
I had a lot of things to do , so maybe I was tired ? !
I know It 's not a good excuse .
I played futsal for the first time in three weeks and scored four goals and ( did ) made four assists .
Btw , I 'm going to buy a present for a gift exchange party on Christmas but I do n't know what to buy because the present is n't for someone special .
I could n't use a computer for a long time .
So , I could n't return any messages .
I am sorry for the delay in my responses .
Also , I 'm just feeling a little depressed about Japan .
The site is really good because there are many people who learn a second or third language there and all of us can help each other correct our writing .
Until recently , I had given up writing continuously several times . However the site is like a social community and I can visit it as much as I want .
So I can keep writing more frequently .
As my friend in the site said , I need to read more English writing .
The article was about a girl who had a New Zealand father and a Japanese mother .
She hated her looks until she became a teenager .
But later she found out about her beauty and became a fashion model .
I was impressed by her story .
I am thinking magazines are good for reading , but I can not afford to buy new magazines and I do not want to read old magazines from secondhand shops .
However I might have to buy new magazines sometimes .
Recently , I got a Blow Off Valve for my car .
She lives in Tokyo so she can & nbsp ; go to & nbsp ; the uni she selected , so we have n't seen each other for a while .
We talked about a lot of things and cracked up : - >
I like cooking more than anything else , but I 'm wondering seriously if I should go into the way of cooking . . .
In addition , I really like cooking , but I 'm not very good at cooking .
And if you live in France , please give me some information about France . ( In English , please . )
If we had a large garden , we could have a barbecue there .
If you are absent in class , you would get yelled at by the teacher .
If you left a message on my phone , I would have called you back .
A : Why did you ride a bike to her house yesterday ?
It is too far from your house , is n't it ?
B : If I had had a car , I would have gone there by the car .
I sold my guitar today because I 'm going back to Japan soon and I ca n't afford to take it to Japan .
I bought my guitar 10 months ago and have played everyday before going to bed .
I told my sister to constantly play my guitars in Japan because my instruments feel lonely .
It is a fact that your instruments will go bad if you do n't play them for a long time .
I ca n't believe that the National Central Library changed the time for my internship and did n't tell me !
So unfortunately , I will have to cancel my part - time job during my summer vacation , and this will also make me lose at least 8000 NT dollars .
but I do n't know how to do it .
how does everyone get so many friends ?
if I send a message to a stranger like `` Hello , let 's be friends ! ``
I really think we will be good language partners : ) `` ?
I have n't approached to people much .
Is this really Japanese thinking ?
Looking at lang - 8 , there are various people .
But I notice Japanese is difficult .
I am Japanese but Japanese language has many confusing things .
I forgot my umbrella ! !
Today is a bad day ! !
Stop raining . . . .
They tasted very good !
I love the taste of pork .
Now , I have created a document on a PC ! !
Bothersome ! ! !
I will try hard finish soon !
When had you traveled somewhere recently ?
I had been to Turkey last summer .
I went to Cappadocia .
Cappadocia is very interesting because there are many characteristic rocks .
One of them is like a camel ( Picture 1 ) .
I scaled some rocks and the scenery which I saw from the upper part of rocks is so beautiful and amazing .
I was impressed with the beauty of nature .
I found a difference in summer between Germany and Japan .
In Japan , we hear the buzzing of cicadas all the time and everywhere .
I love summer better than winter because I like swimming , watermelon , and fireworks etc .
I have to try to save electricity this year , so I 'm going to buy a Japanese fan .
Why I 'm studying English is to communicate with people from other countries and to study jewelery design in Amsterdam ( the Netherlands ) .
I baked a cake using less eggs and butter last week .
I really , really like them .
But almost all sweets are high in calories .
So I thought of how to bake a cake without using much oil , eggs and other high calorie stuff .
Of course it should be yummy !
It had a light taste and it was yummy .
My mother told me she loved it , too .
This recipe has become my regular menu !
It was spicy , but tasty .
The price was more expensive than other restaurants , but service was better .
There was a live band which played nice music .
I 'd like to go to again .
2nd anniversary of going out with my girlfriend .
Today is the / my 2nd / second anniversary of going out with my girlfriend .
First , we went to American Village in Osaka .
She bought me some pants / a bottom and two shirts .
They 're so cool !
Next , we went to Kaiyukan ( an aquarium in Osaka ) .
We looked at lots of / many fish and took lots of / many photos .
I 'm going to buy a present for her ( since / because we did n't have time today ) .
I just heard about this site a few days ago .
I do n't know who made this website , but I wanna thank him / her .
It 's a very interesting place to participate in ! : )
I love riding bicycles !
We can enjoy Miku singing songs as like .
They made her sing in front of hundreds of people ! !
Miku had her first concerts in Tokyo and America .
I was deeply impressed when I saw her concert DVD .
I sang together with her and an audience on DVD ( ^ ^ ;
Now Japan 's economy is declining .
The automobile has been a main engine for Japanese economy for a long time .
In the 1960 's and 70 's any young people longed for a car .
I 'm sure Miku 's concert is first thing ! ( ^ ^ ) I 'm very very glad to see a game character coming to see me out of PC .
I went to Yuasa town yesterday for a business trip .
That town is well know as an old soy sauce town .
Soy sauce was made about 800 years ago in that town so there are a lot of old soy sauce and soy bean factories there .
We also visited a soy sauce museum .
Hey / Hi , I did n't write anything on lang - 8 for a long , long time .
Guess it was because the fire inside me burnt to charcoal and I 've lost my spirit : (
So , in the past two years I 've changed a lot , and now I 'm certainly more tolerant , focusing on studying / my studies , but not forgetting about friends . : D
And , I 'm a korean living in korea . *
I really really want to study english with friends from other countries * *
Life is full of temptations , especially when someone is studying abroad .
My friend and I went to eat supper together to celebrate his future .
After we went on the Internet to play games .
Next , we played cards for such a long time that we became hungry .
I and two men went to buy some food at 3 o ' clock at night .
Unfortunately none of them were open so we watched a horror film called ' The grudge ' and then we slept .
under too much pressure
Out of all the topics in my class , the hottest topic , the pressure we are under is discussed frequently .
It is said that students in foreign countries usually get up at 9 : 00 and then go to school , and it is at 3 : 00 when the school is over , right ? ? ? But the situation in our country is the opposite .
Not only the time table is amazing , but we learn a lot .
Every term we study Chinese , Math , English , Physics , Chemistry , Biology , History , Politics , Geography , Music , Art , and Physical education , 13 in all .
That is scary , do n't you think so ? ?
On the other hand , the curriculum that we study is difficult too .
Now I will give a example for instance , which was the most difficult lesson in one of our math tests ( I use picture to show it ) :
One week has passed in Canada
But I feel a little difference between Japan and Canada because there are many Japanese students who belong to the same college where I 'm staying .
It 's meaningless studying abroad , though I want to practice conversations in English .
I am not good at listening to English conversations .
Can anyone tell me the way to improve my conversational skills ?
I am a student , study English for becoming fluently English speaker .
My student visa was sent to my house from the American embassy this morning .
I 'm feeling easy now that I have my visa , though I knew there would be no problem . . .
It was first time I went to the American embassy .
When I got there , I was so surprised that there was a lot of people waiting outside the embassy .
More than 150 people were there .
Because only 6 people at a time can get into the little house next to the gate , we had to wait a long time .
I stood for an hour .
Lucky , that day was not raining or sunny . .
It is midsummer now , but it was cool that day .
Upon entering the house , a man checked me , and my bag with an X - ray machine .
I was surprised I had to leave my cellular phone behind .
I then I could finally get inside the embassy .
It took more than half an hour to finish inside .
I needed to have an interview , and then have my fingerprints taken .
The style of all the furnishings in the building were American .
I felt like I was already in the US
It was funny !
Have you ever been to a Japanese Embassy in your country ?
If you have , how was it ?
I guess you probably did n't have to wait as long as me . . .
She usually says : `` I 'm so tired ! ! ``
Now my mother is reading English because she wants
I 'm only a middle school student .
I 'll send them to you soon ! ! ^ ^
The head of the department that I 'm in told us that most of the sophomores including those who transferred to this college might 've gotten over 650 points in TOEIC .
I had thought I was smarter than students who had studied at the college just because I transferred .
I found that I was wrong .
Actually , I do n't like to compare myself with others .
One of the reasons is becasue when you compare yourself with others and there is someone smarter than you , you get very depressed , like you 're going to die .
Another reason is that I do n't like people who look down on others , and when there is someone less smart than me , I find myself looking down on him .
As I wrote yesterday , I had to write a rough draft of short paper on behalf of my elder daughter .
Today , I had to translate her message for her graduation ceremony .
She will be graduating from elementary school soon !
She has beeen only three months in this elementary school , but she needed to write some articles ;
But I feel so much anxiety now .
You know , my English is so poor and I do n't have any confidence in my writing at all .
If I had more time to submit , I would write the sentences here and ask you to correct !
A Typhoon Is Approaching !
A typhoon is slowly coming on its way to Japan .
I 'm planning to travel to Gunma Prefecture on September 2nd and 3rd ,
So I 'm a bit worried .
I 'll go to a hot spa hotel and eat many kinds of delicious food such as crab , steak , desserts and so on .
I studied English very much during this summer vacation , so I want to take a rest and enjoy this trip ! ? ?
I want to visit as many places as possible !
What should I do ?
First , I should remember lots of English words .
Next , I should remember lots of Eglish sentences .
she is one of my favorite Japanese singers .
I really like her songs especially this song I put a link to .
She has stopped hersingingbecause of her illnessand will now take a long break .
I really want her to come back and release new songs someday .
Her songs give me energy especially when I feel kind of down .
I think everyone hastheirown favorite song that makes them better .
I like both Japanese songs called J - pop and foreign music .
But Japanese music is more comfortable for me , maybe because it 's easy to understand the meaning of lyrics .
Speaking of lyrics in English songs , it 's very hard to lisiten and understand compared to in aconversation . . .
Does anyone feel the same way when you hear songs written in the language you 're learning ?
In the future hopefully my English will be better and I will be able to understand lyrics .
I have been studying English for eighteen years , starting from grade school , continuing at the institute , to now - by myself .
But I have not had much success with my studies .
For example , I can understand only a very small part of radio and tv broadcasts , or dialogs in movie pictures .
Could someone give me a hand ? Two sentences , A : `` Do you like the green one ? `` and B : `` What about the blue one ? `` .
Can I reverse ( or swap ) A and B 's position in the following article ?
What 's the difference between `` do you like `` and `` what about `` ?
It 's beautiful , but too small for me .
It 's a nice dress , I 'll take it .
It 's been a while since I wrote my last entry here .
How 's life going everyone ?
My Summer holiday finally started on the 5th .
I 'm enjoying it : ]
I 'm going off to Yamanashi Prefecture with my family this Wednesday for a short trip .
I 'm not that excited about it honestly . . . .
But I have got a lot of plans this Summer : D hope it 's going to be a great Summer Vacation !
And , my baby boy is coming back to Japan on the 18th . . . < 3 < 3 < 3
I cannnot wait XD I have n't seen him for almost 3 months .
I do n't know why but I 'm hungry right now .
It 's 1 : 54am in Japan . . .
I think it 's just because I ate dinner earlier tonigh .
I shouldnt have taken a long nap . . . . .
After a one year childcare leave , I finally returned to my work at the end of September .
However , now I am working from 9 am to 4 pm to account for the needs of my one year old daughter .
Since I started to work again , I can not write Lang - 8 journals so often .
Still , I want to continue .
I 'm keeping this journal in case my daughter becomes interested in foreign languages in the future .
A Mother 's journal written in some foreign languages is interesting enough to motivate her daughter to learn to read them .
Do n't you think so ?
My boyfriend and I have in love with each other since March last year .
We went to a very popular restaurant in Lotte hotel to celebrate .
The price of dinner was 62000 won per person ,
but we had dinner free of charge
because I had two gift tickets for the Lotte Hotel .
The food was very delicious .
I 'm very full now .
Lotte Hotel lobby is so beautiful .
He gave me some clothes as a present .
Sony is a famous corporation .
One of the most famous Sony devices is the PlayStation .
it is a very useful device .
It is July 2nd today - - that means half the year has passed .
This half year was quite a busy one for me .
After moving into CA and getting used to the life , I found I was pregnant .
What will the latter half of 2010 be like ?
I hope it would be a good one and I 'd like to meet my baby born healthily .
I hope I can do my best in study and work .
On New Year 's Day , we had a New Year 's dish called `` Osechi `` .
But now , most Japanese buy it at the supermaket and department store .
Because there once lived so many people in a family , the mother and grandmather made many dishes for their children and guests ; however , there are many nuclear families in Japan and are few guests .
`` Osechi `` - making is really hard work .
I will miss the customs which we starting to lose .
And this is my first picnic in my college !
I think it must be very interesting !
The happiness on their faces means I did well .
I think it has been my dream since I was a boy !
Now it is coming true .
I wish all my friends happiness !
I 'm from Korea .
I am in America to study English .
And this December , I will go back to Korea .
I want to make friends to study English through chatting or msn phone .
So add me on msn .
I 'm studying English now .
I am a beginner at English , so I am bad at writting my thoughts .
I want to make a lot of friends here .
Thank you for reading this .
I had a bad cold . I am not very fine . I hope that everyone take good care of themself and do n't get cold like me .
The weather is bad . It is wast to have a cold .
I thought I shouldtake somemedicene .
I think that many of the Japanese members of lang8 will write about the same topic tomorrow .
Because tomorrow is Tanabata , a traditional Japanese holiday .
Long , long ago , there were a couple of lovers .
However , the lovers could n't see each other .
They could only see each other once a year .
Due to the story , it is believed that our wishes will come true if we pray one wish on that day .
I 'm older so I can not remember some fairy tails very well .
It was very hard to write this entry .
Morning glories just do n't bloom because of the sunrise .
They are ( genetically ) programmed to bloom about eight hours after sunset .
After I entered Kyoto University , I tried to play the guitar for some time , but I always gave up immediately .
I am disappointed that I am not patient .
What is the key to not giving up playing the guitar ?
I have a lot of free time today .
I saw this site from a TV program .
I know a little English and I want to learn more .
Right now I 'm studying English in
and I hope that you can help me by improving my English . I 'd like to make some new friends here .
Feeling down
I went shopping with my husband a few days ago .
After we shopped , we went to bakery to buy breakfast for the next day .
I paid money for bread and received the change but I forgot to take the bread . . .
I went to another branch of the same bakery today .
I looked at the price that I had forgotten the bread .
Police dog
I found below an article .
( Q ) Where are you going to go for your next holiday ?
( A1 ) I will go to Kyoto for my next holiday with my wife .
( A2 ) I 'm going to go to Kyoto for my next holiday with my wife .
( A3 ) I 'm going to Kyoto for my next holiday with my wife .
( A2 ) means that you decided where to go some time ago .
( A3 ) means that you decided where to go some time ago , and
you have a detail about the trip .
( A3 ) is more easy and simple than ( A2 ) , so sometimes we use ( A3 ) instead of ( A2 ) .
Does that make sense ?
It is the Golden Week holiday period in Japan now .
We have holidays for up to 16 days .
The job training has finished , so I have to go back to my routine job , teaching math .
Yesterday , my boss called me and gave me some work to do for the next day .
My boss said , he had some business to do from yesterday , so he needed me to do something .
There were just only two students in the classroom .
I helped them deal with their homework .
The job was easy for me .
The two students are very smart twins .
New - type Trousers
It 's been very hot around here these days .
It 's hard to sleep even for a single hour without using an air conditioner .
Last night , I sweat a lot , so I put all the clothes around me into the washing machine .
I woke up feeling refreshed this morning and found no trousers in my room .
Great !
Everything seemed perfect .
I got trousers as cold as water .
I thought that I would be able to concentrate on work for today .
Please do n't say where I am posting this entry .
Obviously , the effect of the new - type trousers lasted only two hours .
Thank you Miyako ^ ^
I can understand a little bit of English . . .
So I 'm practising by writing the diary in English !
Because I want to get better at English ^ ^
Help me with a bunch of potatoes !
I 'm dying from thinking about foods every minute .
I 've read two thirds of the first book of The Main Street Series .
I think it 's a little bit boring .
But I have an impression that if I read a little more , it 'll turn out to be interesting . . .
I 'm looking forward to going to San Francisco again .
My wife and I called him `` The Great Adventurer , `` and praised his courage very much .
I think a lot of anxiety affected him very much and he did not know how to cope with it .
When he stayed up late last night , I told him to go to bed ,
I think there was no particular reason .
Anyway , it was a very nice day for us .
I am looking forward to seeing how he will grow up from now on .
I must have got ( ten ) some kind of virus when I went to a town to do my Christmas shopping . See below .
I 'll see how goes .
`` Otlob `` is a delivery - service site address in Egypt .
So I ordered Mushroom & Cheese Fetira ( Egypt Pizza ) using the site now that I know about it .
But I should go down to the 1st floor because the elevator does n't work today . This way , the delivery man wo n't need to call me .
My house ( room ) is on the 10th floor . ( T .
T ) This is not a delivery service .
It was warm yesterday .
I slipped in the snow before .
I have pain in my lower back .
I just finished my homework .
That 's my homework subject .
I need to use this sentence to write a 500 word thesis .
However when I have done my homework and read it carefully ,
I found that there were still many things that needs to be fixed .
I seem to be standing far , far away from my English learning goal .
I ca n't speak English . T T
Last year , I went to Pusan in South Korea and studied there for a half year .
I can speak Korean .
However , the more I study Korean , the more I forget English .
My hobby is playing baseball and traveling the world .
I go watch a baseball game when I am free .
and I like to go on a trip to the famous places in Japan and abroad . And I visited China last week .
I 've visited more than five countries but China has been the most interesting country .
I want to visit not only Asia but also Europe in the future .
Health check for Breast Cancer
Today I got a half day off to have a regular checkup for cancer .
I 've kept having it once in every year .
Today I was so tired ; too long to wait for my turn .
But this checkup is very important .
I think health is the most important thing for life .
Do you have a regular medical checkup ?
After several days of resting , I 've recovered from the fever .
To celebrate I called my friends and we decided to go to dancing at a club that has Caribbean styles of dancing ( salsa , merengue , bachata ) .
As soon as we entered , my every thought was addressed to the music . So after I removed my coat quickly , my body began connecting with the track playing .
Between all the Caribbean dances , the one which I prefer is salsa . That is because it expresses passion , a characteristic that is part of me . In fact I 'm a scorpion ^ ^ .
When I listen to this music , in particular Marc Anthony , I become one with the melody and I feel free . Everything around me disappears and I feel only my heartbeat that follows the rhythm of the music .
Dance to me is like the air that I breath . When I was sick it rendered me impossible to enjoy dancing , but now I am much better ! ^ _ _ ^
After we finally escaped from the club , we stopped in a beautiful bar where we had a breakfast of cornetto and cappuccino . So it turns out we saw the sun rise , the birth of a new day . Dawn is a magnificent show !
YUI is from FUKUOKA and she is 22 years old .
When she was 16 years old ( OR : When she was 16 ) , she attended Music coaching school .
But then she became ill .
As she did n't have enough money , she began to work in a Chinese restaurant .
Her everyday life became very busy ( auditions , hospital and work ) .
Finally , she passed one of her auditions .
She was chosen among 20000 participants .
A Little Hesitation and Nervousness
I am very busy these days .
My group 's leader asked me to prepare a race speech and a show of accomplishments because we have a vacant position for secretary of the youth league committee in the group .
I just have a little hesitation and nervousness about this .
Maybe I should to take things coolly .
This picture is of a baby tomato in my kitchen garden .
I planted some tomatoes , eggplants and green peppers in April .
I was uncertain about the weather this spring , and I worried about whether they would grow up well .
Fortunately , some of the tomato plants have many fruits .
Today is ( a ) very good day ! ! !
I ( am ) go ( ing ) to ( an ) art school lesson trial in ( the ) morning . .
In order to take an examination in College of Arts .
I must become skillful drawing rough sketch ( for the ) examination ! !
Next I ( will ) go to KARAOKE with a friend in ( the ) afternoon .
I ( will ) sing a lot of songs ! !
It 's exciting ! !
The manga is love story of 16 pages .
I just started to draw it yesterday .
What a bad day !
Needless to say , I had to wear a lot of clothes and make effort to keep my body warm before I went to school .
Yes , I was like a snowman today . . .
Actually , I do n't understand why my school could n't provide warm water to all of the students after they had finished their physiologically need .
Imagine that you have just finished pissing . When you are going to wash your hands , you have to let the COLD water run through your hands .
What a ' great ' feeling that is !
The wind was blowing against my WET hands and I could feel my hands shaking .
I know that I have to challenge nature again tomorrow , even if I do n't want to face it .
Every time I meet a foreigner interested in learning Spanish and also interested in learning the language in a spanish speaking country , their natural choice was Spain .
And I started wondering why .
It might be that Spain is closer to them because in Europe all of the countries are kind of together , or because of the currency .
But then again , South America is far , I know , but by plane is what 1315 hours away from Europe ?
Plane ticket , much more expensive . . .
Then what ?
many things we appreciate being ours are actually the heritage of Spanish , German , or Dutch immigrants .
but this mix of cultures together with the effect of time over our population make us a country rich in art and architecture .
Please if you are planning to visit a spanish speaking country , dont loose the chance of dropping in here or in any other neighboring country .
WE MUST THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO
Japan had a big big earthquake today too .
We collected about 200000yen , maybe 1600000NZ dollars for NZ .
Now what can I do for people in MIYAGI ? ?
The earthquake this time was M 8 . 8 , and the earthquake MIYAGI had was registered 7 on the Japanese scale .
We must do something ! ! ! !
Today , I made an `` Irish breakfast `` for lunch .
It 's too heavy for me to eat all of it in morning , so I often do in evening .
I like this meal so much , but I feel that Irish bacon and black ( white ) pudding are a bit salty for Japanese people , so I eat the bacon and bread together .
oh , I almost forgot that there were fried tomatos too .
Tomorrow , I 'm going to make a Japanese potato pancake ( imo mochi ) .
Its like a ricecake and is made of potato , tapioca flour , cheese , mayonnaise .
I have to use the rest of cheese ; otherwise , it will get moldy .
I had an exam
It was not soo bad .
Met a finlandish friend at night .
my English skill disturbed the conversation once again .
Who inspires me . . .
( He has a ) Shining bald head like a billiard ball .
I believe that everything will turn out ( right / good ) .
He is genuinely interested in other people .
It 's all about Him , my Japanese teacher . . .
Here is the summary of the story .
There is this young Indian woman who has an arranged marriage with a several - years older Indian man and they move to the U .
She gives a birth to a daughter in the new circumstances and one day , she meets this young , friendly , and attractive Indian guy in a park who came to the U .
I have a problem
I am studying English words in order to get a high score on the TOEFL test .
But I am having trouble .
It is difficult for me to understand the scientific words .
Because their meanings are difficult if I translate the words from English into Japanese .
For example , `` Coriolis effect `` , `` spectrum `` , etc .
I ca n't quite remember these words .
But I want to graduate from an American university , so I will study hard ! ! !
My friend and I visited the Morinaga company , and joined the in factory - tour .
It made me happy because I 'm a chocoholic .
At end of the tour , the guide gave us `` Hi - chew `` , candy .
On June 9 , I joined to Google Developer 's Day .
At the event , Google gave me a Google phone with Android .
It fascinated me and I began to develop software for the platform .
I installed eclipse , which is the development environment for Java , and Android Development Toolkit ( ADT ) , which is a plugin to make it easy to develope for it .
The below picture is a snapshot .
Preparing for Zombi Walk part2 .
I went to Chibi Canada to prepare for the Zombi Walk .
I practiced making a Zombi face .
Please look at these pictures .
What do you think ?
I think I 'm a good menacing Zombi .
By the way ,
I ca n't rid myself of jet lag .
Do you know how to get rid of it .
Please tell me . . . . ! ! !
I 've been thinking about writing a blog in English , but I was n't sure how I could start it .
Today , when I was net - surfing for blogs in English , I happened to find this site .
I majored in sociology at Sophia University in Japan since I 'm interested in what affects people 's decisions to do something or not .
Unfortunately , I have n't achieved that yet , but now I 've chosen English education as my career and I enjoy my work teaching students .
It was not only out of curiosity , but also because I did n't feel that I fitted in my surroundings well .
I thought that if Japan was not the best place to live in , just try another one .
You can choose where you live . You have choices - that makes you feel at ease when you find yourself unfitted to your circumstance .
If you can speak English , you can live almost everywhere .
I 'm also interested in analyzing types of societies .
I want to think about what type of a society Japan is through my everyday experiences , and express my views on the Japanese society .
I wish to get feedback from people who visit my blog from overseas and exchange opinions about Japan and other countries .
When I cut my finger , a lot of blood ran out . ( 1 )
At that time , I was washing the dishes , and the sink became completely red . ( 2 )
I was surprised , and rushed into the bath room to wash my hand .
I applied a Band - Aid , and saw the sink looking as if it was the scene of a murder .
( E : examiner , M : me )
M : Yes we do .
My wife , my two sons , my mother and I live together .
M : We all get together only once a year at my home .
M : Yes , there are a lot of famous spots .
E : What interesting places are there to visit in your hometown ?
It resembles New Zealand .
As if the big blue moon speaks to me . . .
I always chose a stable way . . .
I 'm always afraid of failure . . .
I always avoid my true feelings . . .
And probably , I distress myself because of this attitude of mine .
The moonlight asked me to make a life for myself .
I wonder how many more times should I see the moon for me to finally take a step forward . . .
Which is tonight . . .
I only slept 5 hours yesterday because of church .
and went to church .
Hmm I borrowed 2 books for one of the sisters whom I know . A nun ?
remember the sister who I told you about ?
The prettiest sister who
( damn , I do n't know how to express it . )
2 weeks later , there will be an exam awaiting me .
I made up my mind
This was a popular Japanese anime .
It was in the news in Japan , that a man who called himself `` Tiger Mask `` made a contribution to an Orphanage .
Today I had plenty of time in the afternoon so I took a walk around my hometown .
At first I went to return DVDs which I rent a few days ago .
And then I went to a book store which sold second - hand books .
In fact when I was a high school student , I belonged to the American Football club .
I used to be a representative American Footballer of my prefeture . . . .
It 's really true ! !
He has n't changed at all .
When I was about to go home , it 's going to rain . . . .
I should avoid to take a bath . . .
The weather seems to be humid today .
Such weather is not good for me , because I use a bike to commute .
I have done nothing , but I am happy .
It will be great if I make friends with English and Japanese speakers .
For example , let 's say you can not get any idea ( of what ) to write in your entry on Lang - 8 .
You talk to yourself , `` ah , I can write nothing on Lang - 8 today . `` And the explanation of that you can write nothing affects you .
Something to write about might occur to you if you kept on thinking for a while , but you become unable to get any ideas of what to write really due to your explanation of , `` I can not `` .
If you observe yourself , you may find how you are affected by what you talk about to yourself in everyday life .
Being an English Teacher
One of who is David from England and the other person is Chinese .
David is the teacher .
He 's helping a Chinese woman with her English .
She said that she needs to improve .
I learn English not because it 's used everywhere but because I like it .
I like learning different languages .
I think I will write more if I have time and when I am in a good mood lol .
Last day of February
Today is the last day of February .
What do you think ?
We 've already had two months of this year gone .
Does anyone know of any good ways for me to lose weight ?
I planned to stop off at the Grand Canyon on the way back to Japan this July .
But there were no available seats on flights which would allow me to go to sightseeing around Las Vegas .
So I just transfer at Las Vegas . . .
I will move to a new place so I quit my English conversation school at the end of this month .
My last class was this Monday , but I had to go to my daughter 's cram school
I like my English teacher , Sean , and I wrote about him here sometimes
His teaching style is so unique , and I loved the way
he always encouraged me and spoke to me after class .
We enjoyed chatting in those few minutes .
When I heard that , I was very happy .
I am very sad that I could n't attend the last class
I wanted to express my thanks , and I also wanted to say good bye .
If I know his e - mail address , I will be able to contact him though . . .
After I got married , I 've moved repeatedly because of my husband 's business .
This is the seventh time .
People tell me that I 'm lucky because I can live in many places , and I can have experiences which other people ca n't .
Of course , that 's true , but I 'm not the easy going person that my friends think I am .
Moving sometimes works against me .
Sean and I could maintain a good relationship if I did n't move .
I always have to cut off good relationships by myself , even if I do n't want to
In this case , I cut off two good relationships by myself .
One was my oil painting teacher , and the other was my English teacher .
I 'll never return here so I 'll never meet them again
I know that after painful a separation , I have other chances to meet good people .
Therefore , I will be optimistic , and I will anticipate meeting new people in a new place .
The last few days have been strange .
Since I came back home , I have been feeling very lonely .
My mother and brother are in Italy , and my father 's recently working almost the whole day out of town and I can only see him for a while every day .
The friends I 'd like to see are all out of town too .
At first I thought it would be great to have so much time only for myself and my hobbies , but I gradually found out it 's not that easy .
Since I have so much time , I do things I never would have expected myself to do at the beginning of summer holiday .
And I really do n't know why I am trying because I 've never been interested in it .
Tomorrow I 'm having my first Japanese lesson in a long time .
I 'm very happy about it , especially because my teacher is a very good friend .
First we saw 8 pictures and guessed what the story was about .
And then , we read a ( this ) article .
What story do you picture from these images ?
Two months have passed since I came here .
I am really learning a lot , but I sometimes wish the classes were a bit more difficult so I could learn more .
Today , I jammed with a British person at his house because his band lost their guitarist , so he was looking for one .
I was surprised at how people here make friends .
Next month , I have nine days of vacation .
I failed to get a Working Holiday Visa for the UK . . .
It means that I can not work there and will have to go back to Japan in just 6 months because of a circumstance with my money . If I had gotten the appointment I could 've stayed up to 2 years . . . .
It 's so tragic for me .
I 'm feeling so blue despite it being New Year 's . . . .
I have a dream of becoming a teacher .
Or employer of a little shop .
Thank you for you visiting and reading my message !
I will try to write my diary in English to learn .
But I ca n't write really difficult words and sentences .
I 'm not good at English , so please correct my mistakes if you want .
I will be a university student learning International science starting this spring : )
Thanks a lot for all of your help with my English studies , my friends : )
Falling in love
Actually , it is just an infatuation !
Although I trust my feelings !
She is a new student at my school .
She is Korean , while I 'm Japanese . . .
How can I make this work ?
1 ) Give up on her .
2 ) Ask her to go out with me .
3 ) I could study the Korean language
The biggest problem is with the difference in our languages . . .
How can I express my feeling to her ?
My imagination can only grow ! ^ ^
In conclusion , self control and adaptation will lead to a successful life .
When you walk on the road to success , there are many temptations which prevent you from doing what you should do for a successful life .
Without self control you will get sidetracked easily .
When you face obstacles , you should apply an appropriate adaptation in order to move forward .
I do n't have good ears , so I had to listen to the CD again and again in order to copy phrases and write it on music sheets .
It took a long time to finish one song .
Now , I do n't need the sheet music any more .
To enjoy my hobby more , I have to do some work first .
I bought a voice recorder called a linear PCM recorder .
This kind of recorder can record your voice and music at the same level as or higher than a CD 's .
My older one 's sound quality was MP3 , so when I heard the recorded voices , I had to deal with hearing cracking sounds .
BTW , I chose Sony , which has a good reputation for its beautiful sounds .
Japan is in a heat wave and the temperature reachs over 35 degrees everyday .
We have to be careful of heat stroke these days .
It 's important that we take water and salt as often as possible to avoid heat stroke .
Espcially old people have a heat stroke easily .
Japan is strict with electric power because of the nuclear power plant accident by earthquake .
We have to try to save electricity .
New Year 's Eve
I have a 4 day long New Year holiday .
Good ~ I must organizemy schedule for these 4 days well .
I am planning on going to the Taipei 101 plaza to enjoy a firework show .
Although it is a little bit cliche , as every year I always go there to see the fireworks .
I have no idea what to write about , let 's just see if I 'm able to produce consistent English , at least on paper ( on monitor , you 'd rather say : ) ) .
Although I do n't like these commercialized sites that offer everything in the form of several easy steps , I have to admit that the vast , helpful community easily overcompensates for it : )
As I have noticed , people like to break things into paragraphs here , sometimes dedicating one for each sentence .
This is my first diary entry on Lang - 8 .
So I slept 12 hours !
Our bus ran through vast steppe and I enjoyed panoramic views from there .
All animals I saw in Mongolia seemed comfortable . .
Each time when I remember the earthquake , it always feels painful , because of the horrible scenes that I experienced and saw from TV and DVDs often appear in my mind , and I can hardly forget people 's bloody faces and incomplete bodies under the ruins .
Human beings are so fragile in the face of natural disaster .
That earthquake changed me a lot , and it made me rethink how I should live and what the most important things in my life are .
I think it 's necessary for me to write down what happened and what I experienced in may , 2008 , because it will release something in my deep heart and I really need a release . These things have depressed me so long , and I must unload them now .
A couple of days ago , I discussed food with my Filipino online tutor .
While we were discussing , our topic changed to fast food .
So , when I talked with him about MacDonald 's , he shared a very scary video clip from YouTube .
However , natural french fries and a hamburger rot quickly , but MacDonald 's food 's rotting speed s is very slow .
The scariest stuff is MacDonald 's french fries .
I think the guy is from my favorite documentary , `` Super Size Me `` .
I really think that there is lot of chemical stuff in MacDonald 's food .
However , I doubt it 's only MacDonald food , but another fast food aswell .
However , I definitely need to think about where and what I 'll eat .
This was after a decade since our last contact .
He said , `` How are you doing ?
It 's been a really long time . ``
I said , `` Oh , I 'm fine . ``
He replied , `` I moved to Osaka from Kyoto and I still work as a municipal employee .
Nothing , I have no problem .
I just remembered you .
So I called . ``
I felt slightly strange , because he is married and he also has a child .
And he has not contacted me for a long time .
If I were him , I probably would not have contacted a former girlfriend
I just remenbered .
The line had alot of static .
So I said to him , `` Where are you now ?
He replied me , `` Me ?
On the balcony of my apartment .
It 's windy today . ``
OR Why did n't he consider his wife and child ?
I contacted a common friend of ours but he said ex was OK .
I think , sometimes he acted childishly .
I believe he was into it all along .
I 'll recover from my lack of sleep and prepare for tax return .
What is your dream ?
Today , I am going to go to a general assembly of youth YMCA .
Frankly speaking , it is not as strict as we think , because the assembly is held by young students , ages 15 to 19 .
I 'm 20 years old , but I took a role to teach them what they should do in youth YMCA .
I 've been a member of youth YMCA since I was 14 years old ( in Korea ) .
But as I graduate from high school and go to a university , I 'll begin to be busy in different places , with different people and in different ways .
So this assembly may be the last activity I do in this town .
As a student I 'd been [ felt ] stuck in youth YMCA , but the fact that I 'm leaving makes me miss it .
However , I 'll do my best in this assembly , and deliver what I 'd felt while I had been a member of YMCA .
I also have great hope that I can experience new things .
Making English sentences
I start to practice by making English sentences .
The practice is to translate a simple Japanese sentence to English .
Elaborate pratical plans can give you a hand when you face difficulties or feel depressed and help you get rid of unexpected
It was such a bold and challenging plan so that most people around him did n't support this plan .
I went to the community center this afternoon .
I have been singing a song once a month with other chorus members .
All members are good people and half of them are at a retirement age .
I enjoyed every time .
Our repertoire of songs is few and our singing talent is not so good .
But it is a good way to keep a member 's relationship .
It is only once a month and so it is difficult to improve with each other .
The enjoyable time is important .
But 24 is a drama with a little bit unusual situation ( plot ) and is very difficult for me to listen to .
Jack Bauer always says `` What 's going on ! ! ! `` : ) .
Ally McBeal has a very usual situation ( plot ) but I love it although I am a male . . .
I would like to listen to more English through e - dramas and learn more about daily conversation and debate .
Two days from now ( 6 / 12 ) , my boyfriend will come to my house .
My family goes to library every other week .
We can each borrow up to 10 books
I finished reading part of the book this week , but I have to borrow it next time .
instead of a drum set
I practiced playing during short breaks between school hours .
I played the bass drum part by stepping my shoes on the floor instead of a bass drum .
I played the snare drum part using a pencil and desk instead of a stick and snare drum .
I did n't play well , so I 've never impressed others .
Specially , I would often play the introductory passage of ' into the lens . '
The base guitar part of that tune is synchronized to the rhythm of the bass drum .
At the same time , the keyboard part of that tune is synchronized to the rhythm of the snare drum .
But , it does n't make me excited much . . .
Today , we are holding our once - a - month meeting .
I am a Japanese high school student .
I will become a college student next year .
I want to dye my hair and have my ears pierced next year .
But I need courage to do it .
But I will have fun too !
I am finding a way to make my learning process more efficient .
For me , physics consists of complex concepts and lots of information .
To learn it well , I must memorize it .
But I ca n't achieve that , as my memory is not good .
I know that I will lose my way if this situation continues .
Before I can do that I have to find the solution
As we know , success will not come suddenly .
I ca n't expect success without effort .
Because this is important I have to make an effort to achieve my goals .
Now , I find English to be interesting so I am more motivated to learn it than in the past .
In fact , the words that I write are to encourge myself to learn .
I do n't want to give up my studies .
I have goals like everyone else .
I use twitter very often in a day .
Usually , I tweet about what I am thinking , and news articles .
For example , If I read a news article , and if I feel that it is interesting : I tweet its title and link .
Recently , I have began to read news on my iPhone .
Typing on the iPhone is bothering for me because my typing speed is very low .
So I did n't add my comments when I was reading news via my iPhone .
However , my typing speed has improved dramatically because of training using an enjoyable application .
Although the cat is so cute , taking care of it is a big problem .
And now , I really need to keep my room clean and learn how to take care of a cat .
By the way , his name is Miisey .
It Starts today !
I can speak English a little , but recently I have to read English books more and more .
I 'm a senior student at Soochow University . I major in teaching Chinese as a foreign language and international trade .
Responding To The Article , ( ' Beautiful Things Work Better ' )
In response to the article ' Beautiful Things Work Better ' , as a teacher myself , I could not agree more .
The years spent in the desperate search for better techniques , the very practice of teaching with its amazing ups and sleepless downs , has definitively proved that learning as such , takes place solely in favourable surroundings .
The point on which I could take issue with the author lies in how to create the right environment for the language acquisition to happen , given that each person is strikingly different .
The thing I feel strongly about is that it seems unfair to vilify traditional education on the grounds that it fails to meet every student 's needs .
Nevertheless , if we dare take a closer look at creativity , ( and what is learning if not a fascinating mixture of experimenting , forming , shaping , producing and the like ? ) , then we have to admit that , in the long run , success is not a bed of roses , albeit highly rewarded in the end .
Short stay in Senegal
I will go Senegal for two months this ( coming ) fall / autumn .
I will have to discuss some / a few details with my host researcher .
My flight is confirmed as per the attached file .
Regarding the hotel , I would like to inquire about another detail .
Our company will only cover accommodation and flight expenses .
a new fashion trend is coming to Tokyo now .
Please let me know if you think it 's good or bad .
Today , I got on a train .
But all girls were using their mobiles .
And train crews did n't tell them to stop using their mobiles .
Student from America
So I talked with her a little .
I will try harder tomorrow !
I want to improve my speaking ability .
What should I do ?
If you have time , please give me a little advice .
I know , I lost him completely .
Even though we broke off two years ago .
But now , I know I miss him , I dont want lose contact with him .
Tomorrow is our holiday , I should very happy with my family , but I ca n't feel happy .
I want to cry .
and actually I had a good cry in my office this afternoon .
I went into a shop and asked a lady clerk for directions , and she kindly offered me a lift to my destination !
Most of the names of lands are Maori names and I found that they sound quite familiar , being a Japanese native .
About half of the people I saw walking down the streets were Asian .
I just recorded a CD .
I just had dinner and sat down at my / the desk .
I can feel a chill early in the morning .
I like the weather in the fall .
It makeS me sentimEntal and moody .
So I just recorded a CD .
While I was driving the car , I often used to listen music .
Have you heard of Sting the musician ?
He sounds like the fall .
or His voice goes well with the fall .
( I 'm not sure ABOUT this sentense )
The better my relationships are with my friends , the harder it is to say good - bye to them .
Recently , my English teacher left Japan , and another teacher is leaving Japan soon too .
I will have difficulty getting over this great sadness .
How do people get over their grief ?
I realized that if I am in love with a certain man , there will be a time when I have to say good - bye to that man .
Even if we love each other , or no matter how we are attracted to each other . . .
I am confused by romantic relationships recently .
What a sad season it is ! ! !
I hate ( the ) russian weather .
It 's March , but we 've just had a very thick ( Better : heavy ) snowfall .
Maybe it was even a blizzard .
Tonight , I went to a curry restaurant with my friend ( s ) .
There were only a few Indians there , but they could speak Japanese and we could communicate with them .
Keema curry and cheese nan tastes very good ! But the nan is thin and wide , so it gets cold within a minute .
And if you drink water after eating the nan , it absorbs the water and becomes bigger and bigger in your stomach .
Do you have a favourite Japanese food ? I recommend the Japanese food ' Tempura ' : )
My knife is of very good quality , and is pretty handy as well .
Seeing the man walking in public with a knife , a neighbor called the police immediately .
It is said that an adequate workout can lead to a healthier life .
I think walking is the easiest workout for almost everyone , from young to old people .
When you turn on the pedometer , it counts your steps automatically .
It is fun , even funner than I expected .
I recommend trying it .
More than ten thousands steps a day is the target goal .
Being positive is a much more important thing than I thought .
The book also said that you must not say or even think `` I do n't - - - . `` That means that you must not focus on the negative side of any stuff .
For example , when you are afraid about something , do n't think `` I do n't have to be afraid . `` but instead you can think `` Relax ! `` or `` Enjoy . `` Actually , I ca n't agree with this easily , but the point is the same thing Robert told me before .
If there is water in half of a cup , how do you think ?
To be able to answer the former one makes us different .
Now I get what he said somehow .
I do n't have class every Friday , but I have workshops instead .
Since I watch it with English subtitles , it 's not so complicated to understand the story .
I also have a Korean friend who likes Japanese comedy and music . He can speak Japanese well .
I want to improve my speaking and listening skills , so I have a question .
Do you think watching movies or dramas is a good way to studylanguages ?
Removed a cast
She broke a bone in her left arm two months ago .
I really love watching video clips which encourage and motivate me .
According to the video clip , although the woman is 90 years old , she is still doing well and is still creating hand made violins .
I her craftsmanship is wonderful .
Since I 'm not good at understanding Arkansas accents , I ca n't understand what she is saying perfectly .
However , the reporter 's English is very clear , and I can guess what she is saying from the reporter 's story .
Can you maintain your motivation like her ?
After I watched the clip , I asked myself that .
However , I sometimes lose interested in them .
I know that in both painting and learning English , if I want to master them , all I have to do is keep going .
However , it is most difficult , and most people drop out midway .
In the video clip she looks bright and cheerful .
I really would love to be a foremost craftsman like her !
As you know , she is a great singer .
At the moment , my favorite song of her 's is `` If I were a boy ``
But real boys do n't think deeply about their girlfriend 's feelings .
I partly agree with it .
Boys should think more about girl 's feelings , and girls should make an effort to communicate how they 're feeling .
Everybody drank and ate a lot .
Changing the subject , I 'm exhausted today , because I had a lot of workbut everything went well .
It 's raining
Maybe autumn is coming .
It has rained for three days , and the temperature drops to 18 degrees centigrade . It 's cool now .
I need to dress with two layers of clothing , but I feel comfortable .
At the store , autumn fashion start to show off ( sell ) . They were expensive and I could n't afford the purse I wanted . It would have broken the bank .
In my opinion , it was a rip - off .
I 'll buy the autumn fashion when the prices become cheaper ( when the store gives a discount ) .
I am a freshman at university .
I got to know this web site several days ago , and I have got through some entries written by others .
I will spend some time to correct Chinese learner 's entries .
Because I wish more and more people could appreciate my mother tongue .
For the past 5 months I had been watching a Mexican telenovela ( drama ? ) called Teresa .
She was mean , she lied to her friends , and she said her mother was dead cause she was embarrassed of her humble roots .
Plus , she dumped the rich guy and seduced his best friend , who also happened to be her sister - in - law 's boyfriend .
So in summary ( needless to say ) she was a tramp .
Anyway , this past Sunday the novela ended .
My family came to my house and we cooked carne asada . We were all watching Teresa 's last chapter together , and were hoping her to end up homeless and lonely ( like in the original version ) , but to our surprise she did n't .
It was so unfair , she kept the money and the guy .
So what did she learn ?
What was the message , be a tramp and you 'll succeed ?
So to end this entry , I 'll just quote Teresa 's mom : Me das miedo Teresa . . .
3rd , Summit Global Japan reported they would start selling instant film and instant cameras under the Polaroid brand in Japan in 2010 .
Polaroid faced financial crisis and stopped selling instant film and instant cameras .
I took many pictures with their cameras and film .
I regretted that Poraloid stopped selling their photography products and think if I were a rich man , I would buy the Polaroid company and continue to sell their products .
Fortunately there is another rich company and it revived Polaroid .
One of the most attractive points of Polaroid is that we can see the photos we take just after we take them .
But now we are using digital cameras to do that and the running cost to see photos taken by a digital camera is free while photos on a Polaroid camera costs us a film fee .
Even so Polaroid has unique attractive points such as the exciting feeling when we see photos appearing on the film .
Then I thought refrigerator was really like magic , because there are many delicious foods in it .
An earthquake has happened in Japan .
There has been an earthquake in Japan .
When the earthquake happened , I was very anxious for my wife and daughter .
( Maybe you mean ) But I could n't connect with her .
I feared for both her and my daughter 's safety .
After I was allowed to leave the company , I left the office a little early at 5 o ' clock to get to my wife 's job .
I went to the Shinagawa Station from Shibuya .
I think it took about 5 hours .
But we did n't meet there , because the communication network system was n't working .
After a little time had passed , we were able to speak to each other by smart phone .
( My wife is Japanese , I 'm Korean )
I had to walk to the same place .
I had reached home at 5 AM .
So altogether I had walked for 10 hours .
I was happy for my family 's safety .
But I am very worried about the accident at the nuclear power plant .
I worry about the radioactivity .
I was working from the morning to noon today .
I had a few jobs so it was easy to get tired . .
What I would like to be or what I have to do in the near future .
I 'm a positive thinking man so I 'll just do what I have to do .
There will always be tomorrow , so we have to be positive .
Which country slaughtered more ? Japan ? or Germany ?
The historian Chalmers Johnson has written that
it may be pointless to try to establish which World War Two Axis aggressor , Germany or Japan , was more brutal to the peoples it victimized .
It is surprising how western people are unaware of Japanese atrocities while they always compare Hitler to the devil .
Moreover , it is the Japanese who worship the war criminals in a temple specifically built for them .
As if that was n't enough , they changed their history textbooks , ( by ) removing many of their faults during World War 2 .
Instead of admitting it , they 're justify it by saying that all they did was legitimate according to the international law .
Is it legitimate to abduct young ladies from countries like Korea and China and sexually abuse them in the war place ?
The difference between Germans and Japanese is that it seems like the Japanese are not ashamed of what they did in the past , while Germans are not only ashamed of what they did but also did not forget to apologize to victimized countries , such as Poland .
Amazingly , in Japan , the prime minister has been replaced each year .
Anyway , we have already had four prime ministers since Koizumi .
Japanese people are now expecting a new leader , and a new era .
Good American Show .
I 've have n't been on lang - 8 for many days .
I have been too busy with work and school .
A classmate told me NIKITA is a good show .
It 's name is NIKITA .
It stars Maggie Q .
There are only seven sets in the first season .
I was impressed by the superior the focus and shutter speed of the camera .
I have to pay close attention to avoid the new camera being broken by my son .
It is a rainy day today .
I think it 's very important for me to have as many opportunities as possible to talk to a native speaker , or a person who can speak English fluently , in order to improve my speaking skills .
One such opportunity is a lesson with a native speaker .
These lessons are held nearly every Saturday .
They are taught by one of five ALTs ( Assistant Language Teachers ) who work in public schooling .
These lessons are a precious opportunity for me .
Which is why it is very difficult to find native English speakers .
Because the lessons have so few participants , we have many opportunities to speak in English .
After talking , we use a text for various activities .
For example , we use it to remember useful expressions , engage in role - play , and construct sentences containing new words .
Near the end of the lesson , we read an article in the newspaper and discuss it .
The 2 hours always fly by quickly .
I attended the `` 76 meeting `` today .
Company presidents born in 1976 gathered for it and 20 people came .
In every meeting , one makes a presentation about his company . This time I made it .
After that , we drank together and had fun .
There was a light snowfall yesterday at my neighborhood .
So far it has become winter .
I watched a DVD `` Who killed the electric car ? `` ; this is a documentary film that deals with the history of the electric car , mainly focused on The General Motors EVI .
This type of car was invented to reduce air pollution , the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere about ten years ago .
When it was released at GM , it was a sensation but disappeared and the `` Hummer `` was released instead .
This is said to have been due chiefly to the influence of the Bush administration and oil companies pushing out this environmentally friendly car .
Ten years later , now , we are conscious of how we can be `` green `` and President Obama is going to encourage the invention of this plug - in electric car .
The film is very impressive explaining the situation in those days , and how strong policy and companies ' relations are to pursue each profit .
Second of all , I 'd like to study fashion design .
Japanese fashion schools do n't teach fashion design .
They only teach how to make beautiful clothes by means of sawing and making patterns .
I 'd like to turn my ideas into a reality featuring deep sense and study how to express the story to everyone creating a strong impression .
Therefore I decided to study in a foreign country .
Last night , I do n't know what went wrong .
I just could n't sleep , even though I used many ways to help myself sleep , none of them helped me .
Now , I am in school .
Every class , I am sleeping , I do n't know what 's wrong with me .
I know I ca n't do that , but I ca n't make myself not sleep in class .
It is close to Christmas .
He answered , `` Secret ! `` .
Tomorrow , I only have two classes .
So I will go to Kinkaku - ji temple to guide people .
There is a beautiful golden pavilion there .
Can you see it on the picture ?
That is gold covering it .
And , there are three stories each consisting of a single room .
First is the tea ceremony room ; second is the imperial room ; third is the samurai room .
Even if you want to enter these rooms , you ca n't do that .
You can only see it from the outside .
There is a pond in front of the pavilion .
I watched the World Series last night and as most of you know , the Yankees won .
Amazingly , Matsui hit remarkably well and was chosen as the MVP of this World Series .
Since he had been probably the most popular player in Japan before coming to the US , many fans were shocked about his decision of leaving the Japanese league .
However , most of the people are still rooting for him as `` Matsui in the Yankees `` .
I was a fan , too , but last night he turned into my foe .
In his MVP interview , he said `` I feel like I 'm in a dream . `` That was a nightmare for Phillies fans including myself .
Anyway , I enjoyed watching the Phillies ' games and I want to thank all players !
I am going to travel to Thailand . in June .
I have to make a reservation for a hotel in Thailand .
I intend to make a reservation on the Internet .
I would like to request a non - smoking room with a twin bed .
We will be arriving at 6 : 25 p . m .
I should go to bed earl , even though , I have a lot of things to do .
I will do my best so I will be able to communicate with my friends in English fluently in the near future .
It felt great . *
I am going to continue doing it for a little while hereafter .
However , I have to take care about slipping .
I am not picky .
So , I 'd like to eat various countries ' foods .
There are many kind of foods speculiar to each country in the world .
not caring whether I looked fat or not .
do a couple more things , but neglected them perfectly today .
To improve our English .
Do you have tips for us ? Which city do you recommend ?
Yoga is in vogue among my coworkers these days and they are going to the gym almost every day after work .
They always recommend me doing Yoga , but I 'm afraid I 'm not interested in exercise .
Getting the newspaper from mailbox should be the exercise that most I will do .
Better than doing nothing , ha !
I have to speak English at my office .
I will study hard .
The very beginning . . .
It 's hard to start a new diary , especially here .
It was a little bit boring .
We are ( just ) trying to carry out an interventional study with a group of 15 - 16 year olds juvenile delinquents using to the book `` EXPLORING FEELINGS : the Cognitive Behavior Therapy To Manage Anger `` , which was translated into Japanese .
Therefore I have contacted Dr / / / / / / , the author of the book , so that we would have some advice for the program .
With regard to the rating scale and scientific evaluation of the program ( to compare the program 's effect before and after ) , he suggested that I contact you and gave me your e - mail address .
We are planning to measure with the State - Trait Anger Expression Inventory - 2 ( Schwenkmezger et al .
1992 ) for the evaluation study , but we are also thinking that it would be a bit difficult for some of the subject group members .
That is why , it would be helpful , if you could give us some advice for the evaluation of the research and provide the details about the rating scales that were used in the book .
In my opinion , Western youths have more freedom than their friends in the East .
In many cases , they have to earn money for not only themselves but also their family : they become the main earners .
So sometimes they ca n't follow their dreams . Instead , they get jobs they do n't like , as long as the jobs bring them money .
A few people do n't give up but after several years , their passion is not strong enough .
In other words , they sacrifice for their family .
They do not want their siblings to make sacrifices as well .
Today , I 'm going to read a law book after I have read lots of novels .
Now , I must go to read .
Bye - bye !
Yesterday 's English Lesson
Yesterday my English conversation teacher Sean and I had a very interesting lesson .
He suggested to me that I tell a lie in English .
When I told a lie , I was very nervous .
Because I had to make two stories where one is true and the other is false and I also had to tell them in English with same facial expression , voice tone and so on .
My stories were that ; when I was younger , I was a tomboy and most of my friends were boys .
I liked playing games with them and one of my favorite games was making frog bombs .
I stuffed fire crackers into live frogs and threw them towards people .
My mom was always upset about my behavior .
When I was three years old , one day I was looking at a washing machine and was curious about it .
Whilst I was watching the movement , I do n't know why , but I wanted to try and jump into the washing machine .
At the same time I recognized that I would turn around with the laundry .
All of my hair came out and of course , I heard my mom 's screaming .
On the other hand , when I was younger , I wished to pee with standing like my boy friends .
When I played with them , I always peed standing up .
One day I tried to do pee with one of my boy friends from upstairs towards my dad 's car .
We were standing on the balcony and peed .
When my mom saw our pee downstairs , she was really mad at us .
Do you know which story ( jumping into the washing machine or doing a pee whilst standing ) is true ?
Of course , I did n't speak them in English though .
He gave me a copy of the song 's lyrics , but I just know how to sing the beginning of the song , which goes `` I 'm dreaming of a white Christmas . Just like the ones I used to know . ``
Therefore , I checked the song 's melody on Youtube and I 'm practicing now .
I want to read English novels that are written by Kurt Vonnegut .
I 'll get an impression and knowledge of reading English text , which is my purpose in joining Lang - 8 .
Because I went to bed late .
today 's to do list
Today I went to see an English speech contest at a university .
7 students paticipated in it and they were great ^ ^ Some students did n't memorize their script enough not to show it but still I thought they put in a lot of effort .
The topics were all different , global warming , internet game addiction , suicide and so on .
I could n't catch all the words that participants were speaking but I enjoyed it and it was really informative for me to listen to the advices from the judges .
It tastes thick .
What Can We Do for the Tohoku Region ?
Up to now , the death toll has reached up to at least fifteen thousand , and ten thousand people are still missing .
According to TV news , there is still a lot of debris in the devastated area .
, It is necessary to remove it immediately so reconstruction can begin .
Also , the disaster had a serious impact on the education environment in that region .
Because of the chain of natural disasters , the children in the region have not been able to get enough education .
Therefore , since we have knowledge , we can teach them and help them study to some extent ; we will be able to provide them with education .
We can buy as many products made in the region as we can .
First , let me explain the SRI in detail .
However , in addition to these points , social contribution should also be taken in account .
The former invests 100 yen per piece of cloth for the Tohoku region .
If we plan on buying the same kind of a cloth , we will buy it from the former .
Therefore , if you are interested , I would like you to find companies carrying out SRI
This is my assignment for my university
If you have time , please correct my mistakes !
using cell phones in school
Why can ` t we use cell phones at high school ?
Certainly , it is not good to use it
during class time ,
but I think that there is no reason not to use cell phones during rest time and commute .
I ca n't speak English well .
I can give good corrections in Japanese .
Wow , I 'm looking more forward to it than to the World Cup game .
This TV program is very famous in Japan . it is called `` Kin - chan no Kasotaisho `` ( How do I say in English . . .
In this video , multiple people are performing together to form a skit of a girlfriend going crazy on her boyfriend .
She 's throwing water , a plate , pizza , spaghetti etc .
Coming home , my wife and I talked about the people we met at Sarah 's wedding .
It 's been nearly ten years since we got into the University , but some do n't seem to be growing up .
It may be asked whether I am growing .
I surely can say ' yes , I am ' at least in some areas . Well , it 's not that I am proud of myself but I am hungry for growth .
I work as an assistant of a project management team , and writing meeting notes is one of my main tasks .
There is a meeting almost every day , but it 's still hard for me to understand what they are talking about .
That 's why a voice recorder is a necessary item .
What would you do if I said love .
Today is the first day to work in Singapore .
The result is not so bad .
Food and life is good for me .
I had a dinner at a food - court .
I said `` Can I have a take - out of this ? `` .
( I do n't know if this phrase is right or not )
Then the staff person said `` take a way ? ``
Are these different ?
Can anyone help me with my question ?
Difficult !
This is my first time writing a diary in English .
Because of this , I wo n't write a long dairy .
I wo n't go out today .
hey ~ , How about the weather where you live ?
When I was a university student , I belonged to the yacht club .
Almost every member had not yachted before they joined our club .
However , we have had a goal that we will win a place in the national championship .
We have not achieved the goal but we will challenge it .
I go to standing bars once or twice a week .
I like standing bars more than regular bars because it is cheaper and I can communicate with other customers .
Sometimes there are foreigners at standing bars , and I get a chance to talk to / with them .
Some of my friends , namely H and F , and I had made plans to go on a 2 - day trip to Sendai during the long 5 - day weekend , from September 19th to the 23rd .
Yesterday F sent an e - mail to H and me .
According to F 's e - mail , F suddenly had to make a business trip from September 20th , and F asked us to reschedule the trip to September 22nd and 23rd .
So we made plans again to go to Odawara for a day on September 22nd .
It takes around 2 hours to get to school by train .
So in the train , I do things like read a book , listen to music and so on .
I checked my email , studyed and then slept today .
In addition , I 'm also writing in my journal !
I started learning English at the age of 13 which is the age of junior high school students in Japan .
Since there were not many foreigners in my city at that time , I felt learning English was really fresh .
I graduated from university , and at the same time , I quit studying English .
However , I restarted studying English to improve my life since I understand how English is important in a global society .
Both the reading passage and the lecturer in the listening part refer to a question that dinosaurs are either warm - blooded reptiles or not .
The reading passage argues that dinosaurs are like today 's mammals and birds , warm - blooded animals , but the lecturer holds an opposite point of view and maintains that this theory is not very persuasive .
He refutes what is cited in the reading passage ; the fossil in South Dakota in 1993 is the evidence that can support that theory .
The lecturer 's second point is that dinosaurs do not have to adapt unstable climate , such as how snakes and lizards do today .
Contrary to what is mentioned in the reading passage , that only warm - blooded animals can survive from the fickle temperature at that time , he opines that the weather at that time was relatively moderate than today 's , meaning that there was no extreme shift between high and low in temperature .
Besides , the fast - changing weather temperature was never recorded .
Last but not the least , the lecturer contends that a big body size does not necessarily mean having a warmed - blood system .
He agrees with the opinion of the reading passage that giant body needs a constant body temperature ; however , he believes dinosaurs like big sea turtles have a low ration of surface to volume , which can reduce heat - loss , and that is able to keep them in a stable body temperature .
Recently , I 've been watching `` FRIENDS `` , an American drama series .
Some magazines recomended watching FRIENDS to learn English ,
Because its wording is not difficult and they speak natural English .
As a matter of fact , it is easier to listen to and understand what the actors say
than in other dramas such as `` BONES `` ( in which there are too many technical terms ) .
I also enjoy it very much because the plot itself is very funny .
However , there is one problem . . .
The jokes are sometimes very difficult to understand , especially the blue jokes .
They require us to have the approrpaite cultual background or understand unique vocabulary .
This reminds me of an anecdote / incident .
a man told a joke but I just stared at him blankly .
In the future , when I can enjoy every joke in FRIENDS ,
I really will have acquire English skills .
I 'm Aki .
but English ( it ) is very difficult for me ! !
I 'd like to challenge myself to take the TOEIC test .
She said that she likes to take the TOEIC test because she get a lot of energy from taking it .
She has been studying English for 3 hours a day .
I ca n't study English for even an hour .
Even if I have time to study English I will simply not do it .
A few days ago I bought a CD and a radio player .
I wanted to listen some music in the bath room .
So I 'm feeling like spending a happy bath time to warm body .
( not only having a shower , but soaking in a full tab of warm water )
It 's funny how I spend my bath time , is n't it ?
Decided on a school
Today , I finished the trial lesson at last .
And I decided on a language school .
My choice of school is LSC .
But LSC was different .
I have never watched a major league game .
Could you explain the meaning and give me some examples of its usage ?
TOEFL writing awaits your revision ! !
I strongly disagree that the help from government is often not necessary since most people can solve their problems by themselves or with the help of their families .
On the contrary ( or In contrary ) , I believe that even if people receive help somewhere else , the help from government , in some cases , is what citizens need most , because of government 's tremendous powers .
Besides , offering various help is a government 's obligation , whether it ` s necessary or not .
I woke up at 4 : 00 a . m . to go surfing this morning , but the waves were too small .
I intended to surf before going to work , but I could not .
After work , I intended to surf again , but it was windy .
Recently , I have n't been surfing .
After I work 4 more days , there is 9 - day weekend .
I ca n't wait .
I just joined Lang - 8 !
I 'm not sure how to use Lang - 8 yet .
I 've started studying English in Canada this month !
My English is poor , but I 'll study hard .
That 's why it is my first time today .
It seems very helpful
I hope I can keep using it .
Last night , I went to sushi bar with my coworkers and boss ( ? ) .
Thatwas a great time .
I learned a lot from them .
In Japan , when you are going to make a toast , you have to pay attension to your position .
If youare the younger one , your glass should be a little lower than the others ' .
It is the way to survive in business my boss said .
I do n't wanna go out , so just watching movies today !
My skin is not good .
I often go to dermatology clinics or use skin care products .
I really want my skin to become smooth !
Unfortunately my skin has become dry , dry and dry . . . ! ! ! ! ! !
I have colds with runny nose and headache .
On the other hand , according to recent research , Vietnam 's population is getting old faster than any other country .
It 's unexpectedly difficult to correct japanese
Today , I corrected some japanese entries .
but , it 's unexpectedly difficult to correct
The reason is that Japanese has various expressions in one text .
mmm .
By the way ,
I was amazed that there are many japanese entries .
I think it 's wonderful .
I think that taking an interest in such a different civilization is a very great way for us to understand eachother better , and be happier .
Please do n't pile up the dishes
She is a very warm - hearted person .
But she is n't good at housework , especially washing the dishes .
Yesterday a lot of used dishes were piled up on the kitchen sink and I could n't bear those left for a day .
So it urged me to wash the dishes and dealt with them roughly with anger .
10 minutes later , my wife came across me and showed me a white cup .
She told me that it was given to her by her grandmother who was already dead .
My summer holidays were too short , as usual ; - )
The reason why my school starts on Thursday is , pupils with the grade 5 in their school reports can make a test about the whole last year to get in the next higher class .
I am learning Electronics with Informatics and Computer techniques .
The Austrian schools are very universally that we know from everything a little .
It consists many technical acknowledgments , but also subjects as German , English and Economy will be asked .
But that the hardest and the most fearsome test is the `` FTKL Project `` ( translated in English : Manufacturing and Construction Doctrine ) .
After passing all tests , I can decide to start working or go to a university .
But I think I will choose working because I am already sick of studying > . <
Additionally , after 2 years work experience , I will get automatically the title `` Engineer `` .
I kind of thought that , as long as I write something in English , someone would correct my English while sleeping .
but I guess that 's too good to be true .
That 's kind of sad because this is about interacting with real people ,
I guess I have to take action in order to find someone to correct my English ?
Yeah , let me find someone who needs my help .
Someone who is studying Japanese in this case ?
All right , where are they ?
Can I just say hello to them ?
Or add them ?
Is n't it kind of awkward ?
You do n't have to correct my English .
Just tell me how to use this website first !
My best friend is coming from Japan in a weeks time .
She is the first person to visit me since I came to Australia .
It 's not very long , but still , I am so excited to be seeing her .
We went to the same high school but went to different colleges .
She is now working for the same bank that I was working for .
However , on the first day , she is just leaving Japan late in the evening , and on the last day , she needs to take an early flight , so , we have got three full days off together .
I wonder if 3 days will be enough .
So I was surprised at how much it 's changed ! !
I 'm enjoying my summer vacation , but I have a lot of things to do .
First , I must do my homework .
We have an assignment to write a book review .
I like reading books , but I hate this homework !
I do n't know what to write . . .
Tomorrow , my childhood friends are coming for a visit .
We are going to the karaoke .
So , I wo n't be able to do my homework tomorrow .
I 'll start studying right now . . .
Chicken Curry , Saffron rice with Japanese pickled plum , mixed dried fruits Nan , peppermint chai with cinnamon and shochu , Japanese sweet potato wine with kabosu , an Oita prefecture produced fruit that is just like a lemon .
I 'd like to sleep more , but at the same time , I want to learn English more .
I 'm trying to do everything if it 's possible .
My heart is beating now
It has been beating since yesterday .
The reason why I am so is that my close friend has given me a gift for my English study .
But may be I have to get first experience .
So my heart is beating .
Sad News
I received some very sad news from my friend in Tokyo .
According to her , one of our classmates in our painting school died because of cancer .
Actually , I talked to her just last month .
To be honest with you , I did n't like her because she was the kind of person who said whatever was on her mind .
So , I was weak around her .
When I chatted with her last time , it was my first time to have seen her in six months .
I live far from Tokyo , so I can not attend her funeral .
Lately , I 've had a runny nose .
Sneezing seems to be my routine .
I sneeze all day and night .
In fact , I am allergic to cold air , so every time someone switches on the AC , I will sneeze later .
A few days ago , I plucked my nose hair because it was too long .
Maybe I hurt the inside of my nose .
The most exaggerated thing is the tissue I used to blow my nose became a moist towelette .
I wonder if it can be cured with time .
When I was a secondary ( school ) student , two teachers taught us English at the school .
Mainly , Japanese teacher taught English grammer , accents and various words .
Another teacher who came from an English speaking country ( maybe the U .
I had never met a foreigner until then , as I lived in a small town in Japan .
The Japanese teacher talked and talked to us in Japanese for the whole class .
I did nothing except for writing down what the teacher explained .
I always wanted to have a pet at home .
My mother was very sceptic of this idea , but my father fullfilled my dream by buying me a beautiful dog . I was very happy , and I spent almost all my time with my Friend . : )
But one day my dog disappeared , and now I ca n't find him anywhere .
I miss my Friend . I look for him through the window every day . . .
ayami ' is my screen name and my real name is Aya .
maybe I 'll use both here . . .
I major in English and American diplomacy & history .
I am going to the university of Georgia this August .
today , it was soooo cold and there were a lot of snow in Osaka .
so I have been at home all day listening to the new album of David Guetta ! ^ ^
I can not borrow it even if it has already been checked out for three or four months .
To make matters worse ,
I have been made to borrow six books all in one day .
All these are slightly severe there for two weeks . ( ? )
But it was the book which everyone wants to read .
I will congratulate you starting next year .
I do n't like drinking very much but I say hello , and he says let 's ( have a ) drink if you have time .
Although I do n't like drinking , I like meeting my friends .
I 'll cheer you on .
My name `` Galle `` is named after a beauty salon I go to .
I am a student at a Japanese university .
But my English is bad especially when it comes to speaking , so I can have no words whenever I try to speak in English !
So , I want to study modern English on this website .
I 'll write diaries as much as I can / as much as possible .
Please correct my mistakes !
Today , I 've started Lang - 8 .
My English level is like a baby . . .
To begin with , I 'll study some words !
And try some corrections !
I will take the TOEFL next weekend ! Oh my god !
Although I am not good at English actually , but I just want to try and to know what level I am .
I feel nervous because this is the first time I will take it .
I hope it will go well !
I met with my friend last night .
We had n't met for a long time .
My friend is working at a bank and I am studying for exams .
It was very nice to see her .
We talked about many things .
It has been tough for her to work but she is looking for something special .
Something like what she dreams of .
Also I do my best to make my dreams come true .
I think that making dreams come true is difficult and needs hard work .
I thought that as I was reading a book at a library .
`` Dream is eating beads of sweat ( your effort ) , not a rainbow . ``
It was easy enough to understand and quite entertaining to watch .
I hurt my boyfriend 's feelings .
I could n't stand his attitude and I sent him really bad words through an email .
`` I know we have different values and thoughts ,
but this is the worst person to ignore the question of what they 're asking .
So I try not to react no matter who I like or not .
But , you know , there 's a person like that who never cares for others .
It was about him but I never referred to that because I just wanted him to
After sending the email I felt better , although he did n't reply .
In the evening I found out that he had disappeared .
I looked around and I found him in a book room , and he was arranging it . ( We 're going to move another building this month of 13th . ) I spoke to him , he seemed to get angry .
He seemed to be crying because I noticed that his eyes teared up .
I realized my words hurt his feelings . . .
I just wanted him to notice my heart .
He was apparently down and I proposed going to dinner .
We needed to talk to each other yesterday .
If we misunderstood each other , that would lead us to a break up .
I spoke to him about my true feelings that I have felt these days .
I tried to be honest and share my thoughts .
He has always cared what he did to me , and sometimes he felt sorry for me .
And he said to me , `` I was going to break up with you , actually . `` Just joking , but when I heard this , I realized how mean I was to him . .
I realized that I was being really selfish , and when I saw his tears , I was really ashamed of myself .
When I broke up a friendship with a boy friend in college , he said to me , `` you 're always thinking about yourself .
This was one of the most depressing experience in my life and since then I tried to keep that in mind about this .
Even if I loved him I really , did n't trust him from the bottom of my heart .
I 've always wanted his reply , and reaction because I want to find out his thoughts , views and values .
Even though , this was bad somehow I 'm still relieved
to tell him about my thoughts
I went to a fortuneteller last night with my friends .
And I got nice information about my future .
Recently , Japanese tend to say that it 's inconsiderate to have an event or festival or such kinds of things .
I understand why they would say so , but do they not realize it will make sufferers of the earthquake face an even harder situation ?
Self - censoring an event makes economy decline .
A declining economy makes people unhappy , including sufferers .
I 'm confused !
One of my friends asked me a question .
I thought about it but I could n't find a proper answer .
If you read my blog please correct her answer for me .
Her question is the meaning of the sentence below and if the sentence is correct or not .
This sentence is printed on her son 's T - shirt .
One day when her son 's English teacher saw that T - shirt , he took pictures of it and said it was so funny !
So my friend is anxious about the meaning of that isentence and wants to know if it has Do you mean `` slang `` and `` bad words `` ?
I tried to translate it but it 's a little bit complicated .
I 'm sorry to bother you .
Long time since I 've been here
because my work kept me very busy .
And I started a new blog in Japanese here .
Because I read them translated to Japanese several times , I can read them without a dictionary .
Studying English
I 've been to USA three times within two months .
I think I will improve by joining up lang - 8
I was the first car at the signal in the right lane to make a turn right there .
Then , what happened was that the car on my left passed my car and turned right on the red signal .
This car was in the middle lane at the time .
Last semester , things got very messy .
I might not be able to keep my promise for the whole semester , but I 'll try .
I might try to raise the number of entries per week , after I get a decent knowledge of Spanish .
I did n't even have time to think about procrastinating there .
But as the group Flawless from Britain 's Got Talent said , `` Chase the dream , not the competition . `` I just hope that I can make it . Not necessarily before the end of the competition , but it 'd be nice if it was accomplished in time for my graduation project .
I keep pushing myself to be optimistic , but there are some moments when I find this very difficult . Though , who does n't ? !
This quotation is the only thing that keeps me going .
I hope it does the same for you .
Fort Cunning park and MacRitchie reservoir
Yesterday , my husband and I visited Fort Cunning park and MacRitchie reservoir .
Both were beautiful nature parks and we had a good time there .
In the morning we started our walk to Fort Cunning information center to get a map .
It was lunch time , so I went to the Fort Cunning club house where there were some restaurants and a bar .
Unfortunately , it was being renovated !
We quickly looked on the map for other restaurants and found one .
At last we arrived .
It was a nice looking restaurant on a hill surrounded by a beautiful forest .
It was a colonial style ( Singapore colonial house is called black and white ) and founded in 1908 .
If the restaurant had not been closed , we could have had lunch on the terrace !
The restaurant was closed every Sunday !
We wanted to eat anything anywhere , so we had lunch at a nearby McDonald 's ( my husband likes mac ) .
After lunch , we took a walk around the park .
I took many pictures in a daze .
On the way , I happened to see a traditional Malay wedding outside .
It was so wonderful !
We had time to go to another place , so we went to MacRitchie reservoir near our house .
At the reservoir , we rented a paddle boat .
We paddled the boat and it was a lot of fun !
The reservoir was in the forest , so it felt like we were exploring a jungle or something .
This is the first time since my mother came home from the hospital .
Although we need to `` be `` back home by six , my daughters enjoyed it with my parents .
We also visited the grave `` in `` which my grand parents sleep .
God , I 'm so sleepy .
I always feel sleepy when I have some work to do . ( Homework or cleaning my room , etc . . )
Also , I can fall asleep in a few minutes when I try to read a book , kkkkk : )
After the English class in which I could not even understand what the professor said , I prepared for the class by reading a book and thinking about what I 'd say .
I 'm just waiting for Chuseok , Korean Thanksgiving Day .
It is not comfortable here for me , it is too small and too noisy .
But I 'm also really enjoying this life , reading some journals and talking to you guys !
They are all good people here .
My oldest son is 4 years old , and younger 2 .
When my wife was pregnant , `` just like all the other husband and father `` , I thought everything was going to be beautiful just like on TV .
But , after 2 sons , what I imagined proved as such an illusion .
Far from talking and eating around the dinner table with my lovely family gracefully , I can hardly eat my meals to survive .
I bet anybody who has children ( especially more than 2 ) can understand exactly what I am saying now .
Reality is a whole lot different from imagination .
Seeing me and my wife playing loudly ( maybe my first child seemed to have thought we were quarreling ) , he said to me `` Daddy ,
I do n't want you to hurt mommy . ``
That made my eyes water .
We have to learn a child 's thoughtful consideration for others and frankness about it , because we know consideration and frankness always work .
I liketo talk to poeple from other countries .
add me please : )
I believe that most people like playing online games .
I always want to find new online games to play .
However , it is not easy to find a game that is interesting
For now , I want to find some online games from foreign countries .
But unfortunately , they are so difficult to find , even if I use a search engine such as yahoo or google .
So , can you introduce some interesting and exciting online games to me ?
I was sitting on the bus and watching the TV in the bus .
I did not notice a thief had begun to cut my bag .
When I found this , my bag had been scratched by the thief .
Fortunately , I did n't lose anything .
The thief had already gone away when I noticed my bag was broken .
This is the third bag which has been cut by a thief .
Hello Everyone !
I got a day off from yesterday .
Yeah ! !
I met up with a friend , and we went to the cinema together .
Why did I watch a movie ? ? What do you think ? ? I like comedies ! ! ! I will get another day off in 4 days . . .
I wanna go on a trip ! ! ! But I can not get a long vacation ( > o < ) . If you can get a long vacation , what would you do ? ? ( ^ o ' ) b
I like to readmanga .
My favorite manga is Dragon Ball ,
I met my conversation partner ( student tutor ) , Amanda , for the first time .
( She stood me up ! ) I thought that might happen because we had set a date at the beginning of last week .
For that reason , I was really looking forward to seeing her .
On the first day , we did not work on any chapters in the textbook .
She did not bring it because she thought it was more important to get to know each other .
It means she has n't even reached the legal drinking age yet .
I have a difficult time making / composing long sentences and can not keep talking about one specific topic .
She also told me to feel free to ask whatever / anything I want to know .
She let me know her cell phone number , and I did the same .
We set a future scheduledate and said good - bye to each other .
Last month , google was attacked by Chinese servers .
But it appears that Google has already gotten it 's revenge against the attackers .
The above articles are very interesting but frightening .
I got up at 6 : 30 am at the hotel in Yokohama .
The hotel name was Yokohama Prince Hotel , and the room I stayed in was very good .
I wish I could stay longer !
The workshops and one of classes were so boring but the other class was really nice .
The teacher was enthusiastic so I concentrated on listening to her lecture very much .
My friend whom I met with last night after a long time brought me two paperbacks today .
The powerful typhoon had passed by , so the weather was good in Yokohama .
I left there about 5 : 30 pm and came back to Niigata about 8 : 30 pm .
Though it was only a two - day trip , I felt like it was a long business trip this time .
Escapism ?
I wonder if I could take a summer vacation .
I guess even if I take a vacation , I 'll have to spend much time on homework .
Today I saw a movie , Before Sunrise .
Life is n't like that , nowadays I feel that
life has no end of troubles .
Now I can learn English and think about it whenever ^ ^
I experienced the gigantic earthquake in north - east Japan .
Then all of the things on the desk fell down to the floor .
I walked back to my house after about 50 minutes .
On the way home I saw the people filled in the streets walking .
I am happy all my family members are safe .
[ she slammed down the phone when I called to apologize this morning ] ?
Today , I went to the dentist for the first time in a while .
I was supposed to go on March 1st , but I canceled the appointment .
I procrastinated because I have been too busy recently and my teeth did n't ache any more .
Today , I had free time and finally went .
I think my teeth will never ache any more , but I have to have my teeth and fillings kept clean .
Today , I contacted my new boss .
My new boss said , you must learn English .
The reason is that my boss intends for me to contact to foreign companies .
My boss said , I want you to go to the Philippines .
I thought it was a joke .
However , it was not .
Perhaps , I will visit the Philippines in a few months from now .
That was the first time that I had ever seen the whole town without electricity and go completely dark .
No electricity means that everything including traffic lights , streetlights , and stations do n't work completely .
Yesterday , I had a blackout for three hours and during that time , I stayed home and played the acoustic guitar because there was nothing to do expect that .
I could n't turn on my PC , I ca n't cook anything in my kitchen which works with electricity and I could n't read any books .
Now I 've been wondering when our life will go back to normal .
It is not a business trip !
I 'm going to visit SimaneKen this Sunday and
I 'm planning to go to Izumo - Taisya on Saturday .
I 'm a little affraid that I ca n't get a ticket to see around Izumo - Taisya ,
because there is a special exhibition this summer that is
held once every 60 years .
I guess there are many tourists .
Before the farewell party for my friend , we went to Sunset beach .
I 'm trying to absorb it as if it 's like a kind of destiny for us who come to the US to study English .
I 've already seen off lots of friends .
So tomorrow I will go to LAX to see her off .
Anyway , I ( we ) went to Sunset beach .
We swam a lot for a total of 2 hours .
Thanks to that , my whole body is sore today .
As you know , there are two ways to study .
We will talk with our friends , we will want to play outside with our friends , but there are n't any parents who will discipline us for these things , therefore we may play outside and not study .
However , if we study alone , normally we study in our home , so there is n't any partner to talk with / to , although we really want to play outside , there are n't enough friends to play with , and our parents would discipline us about this .
Some people say : It 's healthier for the body to either lay or sleep on the ground .
However , since I first moved to my new house I have been sleeping for one week on the ground .
Firstly my neck was almost broken : (
but after two days I got used to it . Also , I felt more relaxed .
In addition , I have n't found a bed yet .
I regularly go jogging 3 or 4 kilometers once a week .
Today , although I did n't know what I was thinking , I decided to run to the nearest sea that is about 30 kilometers and back .
I have become a fan of this site .
This is easy to study and I enjoy using this .
But I only practice my writing on this site .
Many teachers correct my sentences and teach me .
And I can also study when I have small amounts of free time .
Thanks to the owner and every user of this site .
Unlike most universities with too many buildings and too little plants , Changsha University looks like more than a garden .
Across the gate getting into the school , you will feel like returning to nature .
Wandering on the campus , green trees , colorful flowers and clear water catch your eyes , fragrant smell of flowers occupies your nose , and voices of reading aloud and singing of birds captures your ears .
The best thing is that the road is so clean that you almost ca n't find any rubbish , even a piece of waste paper .
Far away from the noise of downtown , studying and living in the university is a very comfortable experience , and the quiet environment also helps us more focus on studying .
I did not sleep very well last night . @ _ @
Two people quarreled with each other while I was sleeping .
Thier voice 's were getting louder and louder . I could not sleep at all !
It was irritating . > < ,
Why do people always quarrel at midnight ? .
Ultimately , I find myself being a `` Panda `` this morning .
Another boring week is awaiting for me .
I will miss you
My high school was an all boys school so I do n't kn ow how to talk to girls and last night me and my friend , Brett , tried to talk to a girl but we could n't and weonly got her name .
And now I 'm texting some girls but I do n't know what to say .
Today is a holiday ( National foundation day )
`` When was it enacted ?
Other guy said `` May be from the Jurassic period ? ? ``
Then I searched online .
But I think nobody knows if it 's true or not .
and Nobody cares .
The following are the things I have to do today .
How busy can I be .
I think a woman who fights with someone is very cool !
Utada grow up in America ,
I like his powerful fighting style , like a tank .
I hope ! so !
Today I watched a DVD which title is `` Akai - ito `` , it 's my favorite ! !
I have watched it three times ! !
If you study Japanese , I recommend it ! !
The final of this movie is happy end but the middle of the scene was so sad .
After watching I drove my car with my mom , older brother , younger brother , my younger sister and me .
( b ) I assisted my sister with her homework .
I have r seen examples like ( a ) , but never seen ones like ( b ) .
Today I went to a book store to buy an English conversation book .
I want to improve my English and to meet many people around the world ! !
Now I have been doing job - hunting .
It is very hard to find work in Japan .
I really want to finish it as soon as possible and go overseas ( abroad ) ! !
# Today 's entry was very long and had some questions , so I split it into three parts .
# This is an opinion writing assignment .
I should first state my opinion , its supporting reasons , and then make it detailed with some examples .
It asks me to write at least 300 words in 30 minutes .
It means I have to write ten words a minute , and one word every six seconds .
At the conclusion I would like to see which type of person I am by analyzing what I have written , objectively .
According to my dictionary , to state means to express in words , either in a verbal way or a written way .
Today , nothing really happened .
At the end of this week , I 'm going to leave for my parents ' home .
I 'm looking forward to seeing my family .
Till then , I 'll keep going ! !
Let me introduce myself .
most of my family has small eyes but me
My bloodtype is A just likes my mother and I am 160cm tall and still growing
So we have n't selected a hospital to have the baby yet .
We have to think about our lifes ( or futures ) , so we are studying what we have to do for our baby .
This is my first diary entry !
I just started using Lang - 8 today , so I do n't yet understand all its functionality .
I 'd like to improve my English and Spanish as well as make friends ,
I 'm an otaku .
I love Japanese pop culture ,
so if you like anime or manga , we can talk about these things I think .
The restaurant was so nice , and the food was delicious .
We had a good time together , and could talk about the job offer .
It sounded okay but I also inferred he did n't tell us the whole story .
I mean , he did n't lie to us . But I guess it included his hope .
so now I want to learn it . . .
start of the next day , ( starting tomorrow ) I will write in my diary everyday ~
I am agonizigagonizing to find a way to study English .
group conversations , helpfroman institute or by myself ( it can not happen ) . . .
there are so many ways to learn . . .
However , the biggest problem while thinkngthinkingI found is my confidence tospeak english .
I want to say something about today , but now it 's time for bed
I have to go to sleep
My friend BREAD told me lang - 8 was fun , so I registered an account
I visitedmy cousin 's house last weekend .
Honestly , I am worried about their newly married life .
She was poor with housework at one time because her mothertook care of her so much .
I felt sorry , but his dish / meal was betterthan hers .
Some foreigners tend to think that Japanese men don ` t do housekeeping at alland women work for their husbands devotedly .
Some men doesn ` t do housework till now , but most of them help with household chores .
There are a few husbandswho do all af housekeeing like a New Zealander , but more and more men are beginning to be interested in their home .
Actually , one of my dad ` s hobby is ironing shirts on Sunday .
It ` s not work but ahobby for him .
That ' swhy , I want to insist toforeign women . `` Don ` t feel that it is worst to get marriedwith Japanese guy !
`` And for foreign men , `` Do not expect too much when you get married with a Japanese woman . ``
if I get a job , I have no problem . .
I 'm really worried about getting a job . .
I 'm looking to learn to draw .
but school started in January .
I just remain regretting
but it is too late for regret .
I 'm Takumi , from Kyoto , Japan .
I 've never written a diary before .
I often travel via airplane on business trips .
When the airplane sways , Japanese CA ( flight attendants ? ) always say , `` We are experiencing turbulence right now , but it does n't pose a problem to our flight . ``
So , it scares me when they say this .
I do n't think they should mention details about the flight !
A Typhoon is comming To Japan
It is October , and it is very cold .
In the USA , typhoons have women 's names .
In Asia , typhoons have names of mythical animals .
In Japan , typhoons are recorded with numbers , such as `` typhoon # 1 `` , and so on .
A typhoon is going through Japan tonight , it brings very rough weather with it .
Very strong wind , very heavy rain , typhoons sometimes cause floods , & landslides . Some people are killed .
In the USA , cyclones go through every year . A part of the USA is seriously damaged .
Typhoons going through Japan are not as strong as cyclones .
Tonight , I will stay in my house and wo n't go out .
Recently , I have to study some tests for my job .
Tests are related to IT skills , and it 's certainly interesting to solve problems .
Some of tests are conducted in English , so I returned here to practice !
There has been some good news in my family .
Fortunately , he 's going to be a student at the university he loves .
Mom got accepted by the Korean ( ? ) national open university yesterday .
The happiest ever .
It will be four , if Dad gets into college next year .
That 's why every Korean thinks they have to go to college .
The last 3 days we had very good weather , but today it 's cloudy again . . .
damn .
Ooo and our new cook has left ; he thought it would be too much work .
I do n't understand him ; in times like this you should be happy to have any work ; well , what do I know ? I 'm just 20 years old .
Soo that 's all for today I think .
It 's been about twenty days since the winners of the Academy Awards were announced .
All the nominees were deserving to get the awards .
Surprisingly , she had been nominated many times during her long career .
Speaking of Meryl Streep , I found a nice video on You Tube called `` Meryl Streep reads The Velveteen Rabbit . `` When my children were small , I read this story for them and I liked it .
I had caught a call from my friend , whose birthday was on that day .
He wanted to be celebrated his birthday by me , so I celebrated for / with him .
He is unusual man .
Then , my friend lost his purse in the train from Kumamoto to Hakata .
Therefore , we went to the contact center in the station and the police station to ask if the purse had been found .
Two hours later it was found , so we appreciated people who helped us .
Then , I went back to my hometown on the 30th of December .
I met some friends in recent days / lately , and will go to Chiba tomorrow .
I would like to stay in my hometown more , but I 'll start to work on the 4th of January .
I want to work near my hometown someday .
I 'm not good at English , but I want to make friends in foreign countries .
today is my favorite singer 's tenth debut anniversary .
English class finally finished today . . .
I think the one month term was very short , but I was very lucky to meet a good teacher .
He is from Chile but he had lived in America since he was young .
Through his efforts , I could improve my English communication skills a little bit than I did in the past .
For instance , when class started , he always asked us one question , `` What happened yesterday ? `` .
When he asked me this question at the first class , I could not answer it well .
Of course I had intended to answer him but I could not answer at all .
But as the days went by , I gradually was able to adapt to his question .
So if I have my opinions now , I can brainstrom ideas and say anything ( OR : tell people / others anything ) .
Although it is not yet perfect I feel my skills improving .
Anyway I feel so sad with parting with him . . .
I only have good memories . . .
and I think I will be not able to meet someone like him again in this hard world .
It will be my precious memories . . , so I hope to hold on to them until I die . . .
adios . . .
My first time using Skype !
I talk with my friends from high schooldays on Skype ! !
This was my first time using it . 8 )
It 's a revolutionary invention .
I think I 'll be very nervous the first time : 3
In my opinion , a good animation has three elements :
A nice script : First , you must grab people 's focus . What you want to say and the content determine whether people want to keep watching it .
Suitable background music : This is important , and I think good music is the spirit of the movie .
It can allow people to more easily put themselves into the drama .
Of course , the character designs and their actions are important . . hahaa like this octopus . . it 's very cute even though it does n't have any lines .
By the way . . . how many feet does an octopus have ?
This is my first email , I want to live in the USA .
I have been studying English for many years , but I 'm not that good yet .
I would like to speak and write like a native
This afternoon , my Tibetan friends and I had dinner with together , ohh ~ ~ ~
We studied in the same high school in Tibtet , we often communicated with each other about things like a football match , beautiful girls , foods or the CCP . Tibetan children are loyal , friendly and smart .
Sometimes I felt they were sensitive about some political topics , but for of many reason , they felt happy too .
Our high school teachers cared for them , and the ethnic Han classmates were glad to help them to study many subjects too ` ` `
The dinner was delicious , and we drank a bit of beer and played jokes on each other . It was a wonderful time . I forgot many annoying things temporarily . What a happy night in Beijing ! ~ ~ life is cool ~ ~
This professor has verbally agreed that I could visit his laboratory this summer .
In the email , I told him that I am ready to discuss my research plan with him when he has time .
However , I did not mention the details of my plan .
Therefore , I decided to send him another email .
My english teacher recommended that I get an English Dictionary .
It 's called an `` english - english dictionary `` in Japan .
The meanings of English words are explained in English .
My teacher said `` when you study english words , think of english words in your head .
do n't think in Japanese `` .
I bought an english - english dictionary today .
My first time writing a diary here .
One of my friends just told me about this website today , so I came here to try it !
It 's winter break now .
I really want to improve my English !

I have many friends , but I like to be alone on my birthday .
I received a lot of messages from my co - workers and friends in the real world and on this web site .
I think thanks for that .
Playing the piano
My host mother plays the piano very well .
I learnt to play the piano as a child .
but I ca n't play any up tempo music like she does .
These days I only sometimes play , though to become better takes much practice .
Anyway , I hope the weather clears up by tomorrow !
Good night .
Everything was covered with snow .

Today it is snowing . My boots sounds like , `` tap tap `` .
I 'm going to read `` Brave New World `` with some tea .
Hello I 'm a stranger in here
Hello , I am new here .
I am writting in my diary for the first time here .
I 'm a university student and I major in Chinese .
I am studying chinese too , but my chinese level is n't khigh enough .
But I really love chinese and english , and study both really hard .
In 2012 I am taking time off from school .
I live in Ulsan , Korea .
I am currently working in elementary school as a Public service personnel .
Public service personnel is a part of the conscription system .
I try to think , talk , and read in English and Chinese
When I return to & nbsp ; my university I 'm going abroad to China .
When I have enough money and time I want to go abroad to New zealand too because my uncle lives there .
Because my uncle lives there .
Then I end introducing myself .

It 's really rare to be able to take a vacation for such a long time in Japan .
And I have decided to travel across Croatia and Slovenia for 12days ! !
I have not decided anything yet except for my flights .
Aim to take an English test .
I need to learn many more things about Japanese culture , history , and so on . . .
Anyway they are just my hobbies ^ ^
What are your goals for 2011 ?
I like comics .
These make me excited and happy .
Today I lost the key to my house .
and I do n't have a Spare key .
I must stay at a hotel .
Please be careful not to lose your homekey .
And you should have a Spare key .
In the first year , I introduced a low - price drinks server for the company .
And I moved a making systems division to a sales division in October .
I took part in an event which was held at Makuhari as a promotion worker .
I worked hard at the place and explained things to many customers .
In April , I also led the division to manage a network division .
Hence , I will go to a UK university course in entrepreneurship or business .
What do I feel ?
What did I learn ?
And the other thing that I must learn is not be afraid when I speak in front of people .
Although I feel a bit bad , and disappointed of myself because I 've decided to be more responsible with my homework and I did n't do it .
In both presentations , I did n't make an effort to get a good note and I know that I could have done it better but I did n't , but also , I did n't receive the support of my team .
If I was lazy , they were lazier than me .
That 's why I 've learned that I 've got to work harder , if my team do n't do anything , I 've got to do it because the note is important , and I guess that I have to do it by myself .
On the other hand , I felt very amazed about some classmates . They did a wonderful job and I felt envious of them because I 'd love to do it in the same way or better .
But I promise that the next time I 'll make an effort and I wo n't trust in my teammates .
Do you know about the Niigata Prefecture in Japan , it 's north of Honsyuu and faces the Nihon sea ?
Anyway , I 'm going to there for a business trip by bullet train ; I heard it 's snowing and it 's super cold there .
I began playing tennis four years ago .
Happy New Year !
I began the new year with my oldest friend . We had a good time .
He already has a job and bought a car .
I envy him a little about having a job .
I 'm a senior in university , majoring in polymer engineering this year .
I hope I will get a job and fulfill my dreams this year .
I hope you all succeed in fulfilling your wishes .
My Personality
People often say that I am always ready to fight .
Actually , I know I am easily offended and I regret to be rude to people .
The other day , I found out that my cellphone often restart automatically at any time .
