A family , seemingly a father , a mother and two of their children , get on a car .
A funky music starts , singing some worst obscenities .
It seems they do n't care so much about its lyrics and rode on the rhythm .
This commercial film is really reflecting what happens to English learners .
Characters of the seasons are compreat different each other in Japan .
In spring , we can see not only plum and cherry - blossom , but a trailing mist across some mountain which is a crowning beauty in morning .
In summer , if you go to country side , many fireflies will welcome to you .
It must be fantastic scene .
In autumn , especialy late autmn , when you look at many reeds flushing golden and the leaves turning red or yellow , you must feel as happy as if you were dreaming .
In winter , silent snow indicate great intelligence which man can not have .
In the responds to the question as to which season do I like , it must be the time of seasonal change .
I miss passing season with affection , while I admire coming season .
Japanese value evenescence .
The beauty of the cherry - blossom is not so much the appearance , but evenescence .
The life of firefly is very short .
I wanna learning Japanese but I 'm so busy and I ca n't type Japanese on dis PC in the weeks .
I like here , so is Kichan
It tasty wad very good ! !
It takes two hours to commute to work each way .
I use a subway to go to work and change trains two times .

Japan won against Argentina ! I 'm so excited !
But I could n't see the game .

I decided to read aloud with AFN book .
A first section was the inaugural address of Barack Obama as the nation 's 44th president .
Usually I take I - pod to hear some music and English programs .
Today I found a new things about English .

I have felt this sentence sounds that person do n't appreciate .
Yea I learned today one thing today .
I give the fish which was his special favorite to his grave .
I can think of nothing , because of I am tired now , or just pretending to be tired now .
What I am doing now looks like nothing but coming from nowhere , or just it is that I have to think more to find out what is needed .
I have trouble with study , livelihood and my girl friend ( maybe leave soon )
I went to cafe near my school to read books and I walked for a long time .

Englansd , Italy , Austria , Slovakia , Serbia etc .
Since this was the first time for me to see Slovakia und Serbia people ,
Almost all conversation was in English , but I would have to say I had much difficulty to communicate with them .
My communication skill in English is not enough , and particularly for listening .
Addition to it , everybody has different accents in English including me .
So they tried to memorize it associating with `` Hiroshima ( Japanese city ) ``
It sounds funny , I never hit upon such a idea .
But I think Hiroshi is easiar than Hiroshima , because it 's shorter , is n't it ?

When I happend to walk by in front of kimono shop , a cute young clerk wearing kimono talked to me with smiling .
Some pretty girls wearing kimono were in Kyoto or Universal Studio Japan of Osaka on the pictures .
We talked about kimonos or something for a long time .
The clerk said , `` If you had a time , why do n't you try this on ? ``
Of corse I tried .
Because I had an enough time and I do n't have any kimonos instead of yukata .
The kimono which I tried was really beautiful .
I satisfied with trying it on and had fun with talking with the clerk .
But Kimono is very expensive , I do n't afford to buy it now .
It seems that today will be really nice day .
In the sky are n't any clouds , the sun is shining and no wind .
Also there are 3 degrees by Celsius , but it only11 a . m . Today I 'm going to play basketball in the skatepark .

It is as if spring had come already here in Chubu area , in the center of Japan .
This is a quick digression , and the headquarter of hot TOYOTA is here .
And yeasterday was my pay day , so I drew some money at ATM .
But it took no less than 100 yen to withdraw as it is on saturday .
you see , just to withdraw !
The banks are so budet - minded , why should I pay money to withdraw my money ?
What do you think ?
Though I make fuss over it , I take out on weekends .
By the way , I walked to the convience store on foot since it 's so near .
I could see many spring flowers out there , and I was able to feel spring actually is around the corner .
I looked up other words to mean warm and found as snug as a bug in a rug .
I found it very interesting .
My name is phyten !
I am a student in Hitotsubashi University whose department is ecomics .
My hobby is . . .
Guitar , reading books ( especially business and finance ) , badminton , the Internet , programming , and talking my friends !
Also we can play with our neighbors , so not only we can make a friends but also we can spend a time greatly .
Maybe I guess there is a saying , `` There will be fortunes to people who do nicely to their neighbors . `` .
If we share the foods to our neighbors when they are becoming poor , then we can get a foods to them when they become okay and I became poor .
Next , we should get a manner .
Neighbors are the part of our life and society , and all of the people like the neighbors who are very nicely .
And if we should be friendly , helpful , and getting a manner if we want to become a nice neighbor .
I finish my work now .
I fixed a program code .
On this line ' Ninja ' trains - nija 's face painted on - run every day .
But the train I 'm taking is not ' Ninja ' train .
It 's didnt means I get lost but lost my bank card .
Recently , I Was always absent - minded for any reason .
Keep thinking something no matter walking on the road or siting in the train .
After I find out the card was not in the right place .
I pour out the bag and check 3 times with anxious .
But still ca n't find it .
Then , I call my family immediately to let them have the lose report for the bank .
I can not do this any more .
But what I can do ?
I 've just got home , recently I got back home late because of the job .
I really want to say thank you for every one who correct my mistakes and give me a message .
I am now being an exchang student in American , and this is the first time I live without my family , so my parents worried a lot when I said good - buy to them at the airport .
But I reassured them by saying that I would send email .
My first glance at my roommate actually left a very good impression on me because she was 5 years older than me , which made me feel she would support me in so many ways .
When I arrived my room , she was just with her Japanese boyfriend , so she introduced him to me and told me that if I had any Japanese questions , I could just tumble them out to her boyfriends .
I felt that I was so lucky that God gave mesuch a nice roommate because she seemed to be very protective .
For a girl who left home first time , it really helped a lot ! !
At least , she gave a a sense of secure though her boyfriend always stayed in our room even at the bed time .
To let my roommate know that I would bot be a threat to her relationship , I always brought up my questions only when she was also in .
Therefore , she hoped that I could turn to other Japanese .
As a result , I wrote a note to her , apologize and made it clear tthat I did not mean to do that .
If she felf hurt , I would stop doing it right away ! !
Even though her boyfrined told me that he felt his girlfriend was too emotional and that I could still consult him questions when she was away , I declined his kindness and almost never spoke to him .
Originally I thought that everything will just go back to normal , to the very beginning when I was in a good term with her .
However I was totally wrong because now she only gave my a cold shoulder .
Last time , I fuzzed everytime as speaking more than usual .
Sounds irony , doesn ; t it ?
What I mean is the more I study about expressions or vocabularies , the more I 'm confused , because everytime I try to use new things , it does n't come to my mind as automatically as I wish , and it makes me mummuring ( ? ) .
So I have a school trip from 7th to 9th on september .
Although I live in Fukushima in Japan , I 'll go to Tokyo in Japan .
So I need to be ready for school trip soon .
So , I 'll write about school trip when I back home .
This lead to nowhere .
I want to try myself in the material world .
Our turn is 14 : 25 .
I 'm going to my university , and starting chor practice from now on .
I live in the dorm with international student from the U .
She is very good at Japanese and always help me study English .
However , because of her good Japanese skill , I sometimes hesitate to speak English .
Moreover , she always speak Japanese instead of using English , so I do n't have enough chance to speak English .
Therefore , I try to decide `` ONLY ENGLISH DAY `` and I ask her to speak only English during the day !
Come back in time , if I could : (
Annzu had been a stray cat and pecked by crows in a park , before a volunteer saved her life .
When she came to my house for the first time , she was so skinny that we could n't hug strongly .
Today , I bigin lang - 8

Gossip Girl is a propular America TV series that was introduced to China as fashion and life style book .
In the shows , Serana and Blair are the most luck girl who is rich and beatiful , charm and so on .
They possess all the thing which was most girl want to have in the world over all .
The people in the Upper east live in gorgious and lavish , but they are elite who know how to manage a multinational corporation even though maybe inherited from family .
Obviously , they are spotlight in any parties at Newyork night .
we are mortal , directly I envy that kind of bule blood people .

One of serious problems in Japan .
I watched TV news which is about high numbers of suicide during yonger age from about 20 to 30 years old people .
The news told that the numbers continue to increase over 10 years .
Exactlly I think that most yonger people in Japan have no dream or purspose to the future .
Then they feel themselves as useless in the world , no reason to live anymore .
Anyway , present time , we are much richer materially than past but our minds got weaken .
And Japanese society is in aging society and we run out of work force of yonger people .
Somehow we must stop younger people suicide or our society will collapse very sooner than we expected .
I had been to Oita , my home town , for about three weeks for summer vacation , and I came back home three days before .
I felt afresh appreciation of my parents this time because of going back my home town .
I also realized how I had ever been having luxurious life .
I did n't feeling lonely before I went back to Oita , but still if I go back once , I will be accustomed to my original life that has any dogs , sister and parents , so when I was alone , I felt lonely very much .
But in fact , I 'm understanding it is too bad for me because I 'll go abroad in America for four years as a university studdent .
Nobody in my friends live my house nearby , so whenever I go shopping , I am alone .
It is only a matter of time to start my class , so I 'm looking forward to seeing my friends now .
It happend a few months ago .
That day , I was wating for a train at platform as ususal .
The woman , she seemed to be over 50 years - old , came near
where I was stand because there was public phone near me .
She put money into phone then dialled .
`` Oh , I 'm sorry I 'll be late `` the woman talked with big voice that
she continued talking .
`` I was pooing .
it was really big one so it took a long time to flash . ``
so I missed a train .
I 'm sorry I was here on time but it could n't be flashed ``
She desperately explained not her fault but her poo 's fault .
Sometimes people make an excuse for their mistakes such as tardy .
However , I have never heard such an childish excuse .
Othrewise , anybody belive her .
Everyday , going to the company , I watched the video on the iPod touch .
Recently It is `` the sesami street ``
It is for studying English .
`` Sesami street `` is fun for me .
But it Excitement story tired me sometimes .
The word Excitement means `` Hi - tensyon ``
Maybe it is wrong English .
`` sesami street `` is useful for studying english .
that `` less excitement `` english studying video .

Japanese government warned people that there was possibility of electric power failure in Kanto region yesterday afternoon .
Tokyo power company had already stopped their service in the scheduled area .
But they said power still was not enough .
And I filled plastic bottles , pots and bukect with water as much as possible .
We could n't use water , if we had power failure .
My apartment serves water to each family with electric power .
Fortunately , we avoided the crisis , though all ATM did n't work temporarily in one of Major Japanese Bank .

My cellphone has n't been working well .
I thought my cellphone at last broke down seriously because even when I pressed the buttons , it did n't react at all .
On being in the situation , I was almost losing my composure .
No sooner than had I noticed that than I went to my friend 's room whose cellphone is the same type as mine .
He was studying , but I broke in because I did n't afford to care for him .
He gave me some pieces of information about the cellphone and suggested that I call the customer center of the company .
Finished his story , I tried to call soon .
The moment I called to the customer center , I noticed that I was using my cellphone and it was working as usual .
I think it is because of my aging .
Every time I 'm writing an essay , I used a lot of the same transitional words .
If you know a lot of varieties of transitional words such as moreover , in addition , thus , therefore , in short , etc , could you please let me know ?

I am live in Saint Petersburg near metro station `` Ploshad Mygestva `` .
This station are not situated in center of the city , but I very often go to center for walkin on beautiful streets .
Many Peterburg 's streets save some especial historical form .
Little courtyards , narrow streets buildings from 19 century surrounded you and can movie you in this fantastic time .
And a lot of cars , shops and coffe houses ca n't break this illusion .
You may walk in this city many days and every day you will open some new details of this atmosphere for youself .
Many times I just walk on `` Nevsky prospect `` and go to the Aleksander Nevsky square .
Sometimes when I do not hurry I am just turn on right or left in random crossroads and aimlessly walk on little streets feel this unique atmosphere .
If you ever will in Saint Petersburg and you will have many time , I advise you just walk on the city one or two hours without any excursions and you will feel this unique atmosphere of 19 centure .

Those are serious .
In Hong Kong , the government focus on the drugs problem .
Also , Many social workers are concerning about the family and violence problems .
However , it is in lack of taking care of young people sexual behaviour .
But why is this issue in recent years will be even more serious ?
The researchers note that `` If women exposed to abuse , domestic violence , and family strife has enduring .
Also there are many cases which teenagers give up their babies in the street or abortion .
The most important thing , they do not think they are wrong .
She write diary and post her pregnant photos on the Internet .
She was proud of her pregnant .
We have three kinds of solution to solve teenage pregnancy problem .
The second one is non - government and social workers and the last one is consulting with other countries policies .
Firstly , government should support more in sex education .
Also teenagers feel embarrassed to communicate with their teachers and parents .
And their peer group affect them .
For example , peer group may give the wrong messages of sex to them .
Teenagers may misunderstand of sex which get the wrong information from peer group .
They have curious about sex and try .
After the sex education , it reduces the rate of teenage pregnancy .
Teachers can take care of teenagers which teaching them safe sex .
Also it can lessen their curious and let them learn the the correct values .
Moreover , mass media give unsuitable messages to young people , for example , Mother at 14 ( television drama ) , My Guardian Characters ( children 's comic book ) and Juno ( Film ) those are negative message .
They may think teenage pregnancy is universal phenomenon and western culture or it does not a problem and not special .
Also it is a trend to follow .
So , Hong Kong government should set up the law such as supervise the mass media .

It 's the easiest to listen to English in music , especially the Beatles and Tthe Carpenters .
( Some music is impossible to listen , though ) It 's the secound easiest to listen to English on radio .
I often listen to J - wave in my car , a Honda Fit .
Personalities in the radio programme are very friendly and gentle , which means we may easily listen to the programmes without any offense , but sometimes I do n't like their goody two shoes attitudes .
At first , I noticed familiar face when I was going to buy underwears at UNIQULO that the largest apparel company in Japan but I did n't have confidence that He was my old friend .
Because I have never met him since junior high school graduation .
I did not write dairies for almost a week because I was lazy . ( I am not going to say BUSY ) My previous English tutor told me that never use BUSY as the excuse to postpone something , because no matter how much busy you are , millions people will be busier than you such as presidents , CEOs , Famous and a lot of people .
I went to the Chinese medicine hospital last Thu , helped my Japanese friend to find a sweet room on Fri , set up the internet and went to a darts bar with him on Sat , played the beach vollyball and fooled around with some new friends at a beautiful beach in the north Taiwan on Sunday .
How do I become better English speaker ?
That 's just a matter of keeping practicing .
Today , I got a dayoff and went to see the circus with my family .

My daughter 's pleasure was the best for me on this show .
But if someone ask me to go again , I wo n't go even I pay .
Recently I was a bit lazy . . .
decent : His father wanted him to get decent education , so his family moved from his country .
innocent : He tried to prove his innocence , but no one did n't believe what he said .
sesitive : She said her skin is sensitive to every stimuli so she does n't wanna go on a hike .
serious : I thought she was joking , but when I looked at her face , it was quite serious so I realized she was saying the truth .
noble : I think every person need something noble in their life .
brave : My friend said I 'm brave , but I could n't find any brave character in me .
I wonder if the usage of `` serious `` above is correct .
Thank you for always writing comment .
I 'm happy and it is studied .
I think that it is difficult to always think as for the English .
Because I want to go for studying abroad someday , I do my best .
It is nice , becouse it is studied and the word is learned .
I enjoy spending life every day .
I started learning english recentry .
English is very difficult to me , but I enjoy to learn that .

In the spring break , I went to bed around 3 a .
m and sleeped till 1 p . m .
The new semester will start from next week and some class will begin at 11 a . m .
It 's a shame to let them just pass for lazy sleeping .
So I wake up at 8 a .
It 's not easy for me to wake up ealry and sometimes I feel an irrestitible urge to sleep in daytime , but still I manage to get out of bed at least 8 a .
I have an appointment to meet my boss in the new workplace tomorrow a bit late night .
I will fight myself to keep me awake tomorrow ! !
That included electronic dictionary that I borrowed from her long time ago .
I had forgotten to return but she suddenly called me and asked to return .
So I found in my desk and she sent it with some souvenir .
I called my mom and let her know it was sent from my wife this morning .
After I finished my work , I met a friend who is member of same English circle .
She has a lot of DVDs which was counted over 200 !
I introduced the Lang - 8 to her .
I said it was good for study .
Then we went for drink a little and had a good time to talk .
She said she wanted to begin studying English radio program .
So we will study the same program and check what we learn every week .
No sooner did I come back home by bicycle than did the rain fall .
Yesterday I bought a great deal of ripen tomatoes .
I should or , actually , I have to study hard this week - end , but you know , there 's always some stuff that catch my attention more than studying .
What is Happiness ? Part 2
While I was listening to her story , I was looking at my dinner that already became cold .
Both we were n't eating .
She sometimes showed me her tears and sighed .
Actually I had no idea to encourage her , so I decided to become a good listener .
However , I listened to her story silently .
All I could do was to grip her hands .
To tell you to the truth , I really wanted to hug her , but I could n't because I did n't want to surprise her .
Hugging is n't a part of Japanese culture .
That 's life .
It becomes cheaper compared with before .
Though the origin of golf is unclear , it seems that shepherds knocked stones into rabbit holes is an established theory .
If it has been remaining , the cost is nothing , right ?
Anyway , I want to see Tiger play golf greatly .
It is hard rain today .
In Japan , a lot of typhoon come in September .
I am worried about the way home .
Probably the train will stop .
My interpreter 's class was so tough for me at last lesson .
The theme was `` About social participation in Japan . ``
One of my classmate presented that Japanese nation is straggling and facing low economical also political .
For the past twenty years , Especially middle - aged men has much abilities and powerfull .
They could controled all over the Japan .
However they do n't have enough abilities and display now .
So we need get second wind .
In the future more people who are women , non - residence and youth would be participate in any social movements .
It 'll be better than now .
That theme was felt abstract for me .
I thought she should have present more detail concrete .
We are , naturally , always looking for the best method , the fastest way , the easiest patch to mastering English , Japanese , Spanish , whateverish . . .
On the other hand , good methods [ Assimil ? ] when wrongly used can produce poor results .
In the end , what you should know , what you should [ at least you should . . . ] notice by yourself is that there is n't A METHOD for language learning .
Each student have to find his own method , his own way of learning .
Of course this is n't an easy thing to do .
I know some things work and some do n't , but to find out exactly how do it is n't that easy .
All methods have good and bad points , so what you have to do is notice the good points and use it in your way .
Of course I 'm being a bit stagy , but I just want to show that there is n't one method that rules over all others .
If you work - hard on it , you probably will not only find out what learning methods and strategies suit you better , but you also will start to notice some universal principles about language learning .
The average language learner , who usually follows just one methods ( like many English teacher here in Brazil who have learned English using the same method for more than 20 years ) , will probably not learn these principles and , therefore , become kind of limited when it comes to how to learn a language .
We had a very good time playing chasing game in the water .
I 'm very happy to see tat my daughter started to have more confident in the water because she could n't put her face in the water before she goes to swimming lessons .
She was even scare of getting a bit of splash on her face when she had a shower .
Now she can head - stand in the water !
As her school will have a swimming lesson starting soon , hopefully she has no problem in the water and can enjoy swimming with others .
I can tell the chlorine in the pool was very strong since even though a bit of splash of the water hurts my eyes quite a bit .
In addition to that , I felt really tired after getting out of the water although I had n't swim much .
It has been already December .
Did you enjoy every day ?
You go , and there is not the loss .

Grammar is difficult for me x ( I want to have confident my English .
I made a goof yesterday .
And , I also stopped by a superemarket near my house to buy something to get a bite .
When I went back home , I left things I bought at the drug store over there and forgot about it !

Fortunately , He kept them , and I could find them .

I talked about study abroad with professor .
I ate out with friend .
A short time ago , my friend changed to a cockroach .
I 'll write about the story at my bathroom .
I washed oneself with my body sponge , like a panda as the everyday .
Then , something did happened .
Suddenly `` the fellow `` was passing me so quickly !
It 's a cockroach ! `` I shouted , and pointed shower at it .
After a few minutes , I took back my calm mind .
It wo n't move .
It was body sponge 's leg ( panda 's ) .
I somehow laugh .
I decided to operate it ( decided to weave its leg . )
After all , it got back its ordinary figure safely .
Now , it watch me from the desk .
What a fearful story this was ! !
It is difficult for me to speak and write with English .
And let 's tell own language each other ! !
My thinking was brought to a standstill .
I have no idea for that .
So , it is nothing and nothing again .
Where does my inspiration go ?
I traved with my class 3 days ago .
Although we were tired but everybody felt pleased .
We took many photo , about 700 pictures .
we went to a island , it name is Thung Nai , this is a new tourist spot .
People who live there is friendly , has fresh air , has many fruit trees .
After this journey I understand my friends and love them so much .
I think they feel its , too .
Today 's Yokohama was rainy day thought I had fulfilled my plan in my previous journal .
Heavy feeling of my body was vanished by to exercise indoor climbing .
Instead , my palm skin like peel and I can hardly move my tired body .
But I 'll be into good night 's sleep .
So I 'll must fight feeling that is not go to my office .
I guess I 'll be assaulted to muscle ache in the morning tomorrow .
I 've read The Scheme Team that is 5th book of Chestnut Hill Series .
Chestnut Hill Sreies are written by Lauren Brooke .
They are 7th grader students of a borading school for girls called Chestnut Hill .
The school has good horse riding programs as well as educational 's .
They face some dificulties .
But each case , they help each other to overcome those .
In this series , the relationship with horses is n't so main topic of the story , comparing with Heartland Series .
Still the devotion to horses of heroines is imporant .
The interviewers ask us [ 18 interviewees including me ] to come up with an idea of a new product and the marketing strategy to make it outstanding .
I was really surprised but not nervous because I takes International Business Management at the university .
There had been 2 interviews before I got the internship program .
Moreover , the new employees who had just come to work only 2 weeks told me to finish his work of 19 page translation within 2 weeks .
And to compose 17 English vocabulary poems for SAT course .

Have you ever watched the movie `` THIS IS IT `` ?
In Japan , the movie got a No . 1 on a weekly movie chart .
A lot of my friends have watched `` THIS IS IT `` and all of them has been enthusiastic to Micheal Jackson .
I 've been also a fanatic to Michael Jackson since I was teenager , but I ca n't go to watch the movie because I have to take care of my two young children with my wife . . .
BTW , I can dance choreographs of Micheal Jackson 's promotion videos , such as `` Thriller `` and `` Billie Jean `` , `` Smooth Criminal `` .
I will teach a choreograph of `` Thriller to my friends , who belongs to a dance club member .
I made GM which appears in Japanese animation `` Mobile Suit Gundam . `` I like this robot .
It is also fun to paint differently from original version .
Yesterday , I submitted graduate thesis .
I thought that submitting was equal to the certification of my graduation since my thesis was already checked by my professor .
But in fact , I understood that in March I have to take oral examination about my thesis .
I 'm a little disappointed with this fact .
I had planed how I spend my holiday . . .

Usually I 'm the one who always complain about the air - conditioner in my office .
I always feel hot and I always shout hot and hot to my colleagues , but now I have to turn off the air - conditioner .
I sit near the window so it 's the hottest place in the room but now although the sky is full of sunshine and all the heat is coming through the window do n't make me feel warmer .
I have to take some medicines first before the real cold catch me ( ^ _ _ ^ )

He had smoked with his friends secretly .
His class teacher came to my house .
He told me what had happened until now .
This is the first time that I have heard their circumstances .
I thought that my son wanted to escape from being forced
I reflected on myself a lot and I said to him .
`` You do not have to study so much , so that you should stay home anyway . ``
I have heard the sound of walking on the roof .
One day the voice has been heard out of his room , so I tried to open the door of his room .
Then , I saw two boys who hid behind the bunk bed .
I persuaded them about a few things .
I am sorry that you do not keep the promises with me about stopping smoking and studying harder .
How should I do ?
This is my first try to this site .
So I would like to communicate whoever wants to .
I tend to belive in ghost because I was born in small town .
The population of my twon was low .
My neighbor 's house was old so it is easily broken if the typoon come in our regin .
Before I tried to sleep at nigtht I always went to restroom and I can see their house .
I ca n't do anything because I was kizs .
I called my mom : Hey I found a cockroach so please kill them .
comon mom !

I often use something like that .
My high school ( 4 )
They thrilled me nearly throughout the school year of Grade Two .
Of course , I was worried about that my behavior was found as I was enjoying them .
My behavior was found at last .
I was suspended to make a self - examination .
At beginning , though , I found that I could not catch up with my lessons , for I had missed so many lessons .
In this way , it took me four years to finish the three - year junior high school .
She liked a new hosoital because docter explained her well .
It 's very easy level .
I heard it 's good to read many books in suitable level .
Now , the number of words I read is 2666 words .
iPod nano the 5th generation
I bought an iPod nano the 5th generation last December .
So it is not easy for me to use Mac style .
I can import music into iPod nano but ca n't understand the way about any pictures .
Finally , today , I found out how to import some pictures into iPod nano !
I am very happy for doing that .
I had a very busy day today , because I had two classes , checked students ' notebooks , there was a bisiness trip .
I was going to go to conversational English class , but English teacher caught a cold yesterday , so today 's lesson was canceled .
I went to the Mexican restaurant `` El Torito `` tonight and ate Enchilada , Salsa chips , Ceaser sarada , and ice cream and drunk Margarita which was frozen with salt fringe around the glass .
I like Margarita very much , but its alcohol level is kind of high , so I 'm always getting sleepy after drinking .
There are many tv screens hanging on the wall and the tv channel is always sports channel `` ESPN . `` Today 's sports was baseball .
football season will start on August . . . . .
so now what we can watch is baseball games and hockey games .
Today is the Guy Fawkes Night ( or bonfire night ) in Oxford .
Although it is officially the fifth of November , the event is set to Saturday night this year .
Last year my wife and I went to the bonfire held at the South Park .
Although it was a chilling night , the large park was full of crowds .
Guy Fawkes tried to blast the Parliament in order to kill King James I of England and VI of Scotland , but failed and arrested on the fifth of November in 1605 .
The failed assassination attempt is now called as the gunpowder plot .
For some reason , the British have been celebrating this day with bonfire and fireworks for more than 400 years .
I 'm not even sure that the British are either in favour of or against Guy Fawkes himself and his plot .
In my opinion , most of them may be taking advantage of his failed attempt to enjoy fireworks with a good reason .
For me as a Japanese , fireworks on a cold autumn night are very unusual and even surreal experience , since fireworks are icons of the hottest summer season in Japan , reminding me the humid and hot air , girls wearing yukata ( by the way , girls with yukata look 30 % more attractive and prettier then usual ) , kakigori ( crushed ice with fruit - flavoured syrup ) , and so on .
When a British `` guy `` visits Japan and sees fireworks festivals in summer , what sort of emotions would he register ?
Drowsiness
I stayed up all night last night , and so I am terribly sleepy today .
However , I do it .
Because drowsiness harms study , it is necessary to take care .
There is most schools in Japan during summer vacation .
But I must go to school tomorrow .
Our school becomes a rest at the end of this week .
I am looking forward to it very much .
Packers vs . Falcons

The Falcons has beaten the Packers in this season .
This clip tells me that the next game is too close to call .
This movie 's origin is graphic novel `` WATCHMEN `` , writed by Alan Moore , illustrated by Dave Gibbons .
I can say , `` WATCHMEN `` beat reader 's mind .
What is the evil ?
What is the justice ?
What is the humanity ?
We can be forgiven to sacrifice someone for save the world ?

I went out to Yakitori restaurant with my collegue after work last night .
It was so hot during the day , so I wanted to go to a restaurant in which air conditioner works .
When we standed in front of the door of that restaurant , we found the door opened .
I had feeling that what I did n't hope would happen .
Due to hot atmosphere I could drink much beer .
I felt comfortable when wind sometimes blew into the restaurant .
As you might know , yakitori is popular Japanese food .
It is made from several bite - sized pieces of chicken meat , or chicken offal , skewered on a bamboo skewer and barbecued .
It served with salt or with `` tare `` sauce , which is generally made up of mirin , sake , soy sauce and sugar .

Since then , I 've been interested in economics so much .
The economics in Japan is easy to be affecteed by that of foreign country ( especially US ) .
Of course not only Japan , many countries ' economics is affected by other countries ' it .
Now , in my country , many people were fired their jobs , and what is worse , it 's difficult for any people to find new job .
There 're many bad news in this way now . . .
However , do n't you think it 's interesting that the relationship of economics between a country and another country ?
I think it 's still too early for me to talk about economics in english .
Since I 'd like to know about these places as much as possible , I am reading guide books and checking the internet every dsay .
I Have Aware

It 's famous joke , so maybe you have heard .
I think it is a simple story but can teach us important lesson about our life .
One night , a man goes out drinking at a local bar .
After saying goodbye to his friends , he begins walking home , singing happily to himself .
As he nears his apartment , he takes his keys out of his pocket but drops them on the ground in the dark .
On realizing his keys are missing , he wanders over to a nearby street lamp and begins looking for them there .
I had a trouble with my English .
Though I learned English for a long time .
I knew my problem was that I cound 't catch the means what people said , and my pronunciation was too bad .
I wanted to be able to master English conversation , but I spent my much time studying grammar , even I tried to read newspaper and novels .
All study is helpful , but it is n't effective .
It is important for me to know what I want and focus on that .
Japanese comedians sometimes parody foreigner 's Japanese speakings .
The features are omitting particles , wrong accents and intonations and it seems that they can be categorised by nationalities .
I suppose this may be true from my experiences and acutually English children learn nursery rhyme in a language acquisition .
Otherwise , if Japanese learners mimiced their rhythm even if it was strange Japanese , they might obtain a skill to speak naturally .
Junzo Kawada is a researcher in cultural anthropology and he went to Africa to research a tribe that do not have letters .
He clamed that they have imagination in their minds and they convey them to the drum .
When I listened to this story , I thought this is like typing a keyboard .
And there are acutually some rhythm patterns when I hit the keyboard .
It takes about a minuet to the station .

He said you coud get out by no fare , next time you get in our bus , you should tell the driver this story , and pay this fare .
I thanked him , and got out of the bus .
In the way to my home from bus stop , I was soaking wet .
Hi every one , nice to meet you .

I also bought a wine glass to driking wine .
