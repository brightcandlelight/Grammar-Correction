I talked about my memories of sports day , my dream and
However , we do n't have to go to school until we find out the results of our exams ,
Today I 've enrolled at this website .
I 'd like to be better my English but it 's difficult for me to make sentences in English because of its collocations .
So I 'm happy if you would correct my diary .
If you 're trying to learn Japanese , then I 'll correct yours .
My girlfriend and I are contemplating marriage .
We plan to register our marriage on April 1st , April Fool 's Day , because the day is very memorable .
As they heartily congratulated us hearing our news , I was very relieved .
It 's too cold today
But I do n't think so
If you have n't ever been here , please come here for the summer : ) haha
Starting today , I 'm going to write a diary in English .
By writing my diary in English , I aim to make my English skills better and to be able to communicate with people abroad .
By writing down the daily events , I also aim to review each day and make the next day better .
I will try to do it every night .
My first goal is to continue to write my diary for one month .
Yesterday I went to Cairo to play chess match and I won .
But the weather was very cold and rainy .
This afternoon I finished the TEC - 6 at last .
I felt a burden had lifted from my shoulders .
Now I can concentrate my attention on the final examinations and essays .
Of course , I hope I can pass it .
Tomorrow is my birthday . I ca n't wait to know what suprise my classmates might give me .
I believe that tomorrow will be an unforgettable day because of my lovely friends .
I like flying .
I learned how to fly an aircraft .
This picture was taken while I was learning to fly .
Do you like flying in the sky ?
How to fall asleep quickly
If you start to exercise and really tire out your body , you will be nice and exhausted when it is time to go to bed .
When I began running , especially longer distances ( it took me awhile to build up to that , though ) , I would go to bed and welcome the sweet release of sleep .
In order to run , I began waking up early , using these tips in the article you read .
They worked , and the flip side of the equation is that I became so tired at night that after awhile , I just could not stay up late anymore .
If you begin waking up early , you might betired ( OR feel tired ) for a few days , and eventually you will be forced either to go to sleep earlier or wake up later .
It 's easy - - - - I 've done it a lot of times .
But if you turn those things off and go to bed , and read something in bed , you will probably fall asleep , and you will be really tired if you followed those two tips I gave above .
Exercise and wake up early , and then go to bed and read something .
My PC was broken .
I sent it to the service center .
Yes , I am writing this diary with a brand new PC !
I made sauce with horse mackerel .
Horse mackerel is very cheap .
It cost me only 100 yen for 18 horse mackerel !
It was a delicious Japanese dinner : )
I felt a little homesick for my mother 's cooking ; (
Recently I always cook for myself .
I will have dinner with my friends from orchestra .
I am looking forward it , but am a little bit scare of it .
He approached us at today 's party .
To be able to do a presentation is an important skill , is n't it ?
I live in Saitama which is next to Tokyo .
It takes 30 minutes from here to Tokyo .
I registered for this site to study language . My friend recommended
it to me because someone can check out my journals and I can make friends from other countries .
It would be great , if I could make many friends and learn about another country 's culture .
After a 3 - week - stay in my relative 's home , I went to my grandmother 's home in Lishui with my family to celebrate Chinese New Year together .
Then I came back to Jinhua and visit other relative 's houses , and finally I returned to university to prepare for my new semester .
I also have six modules to learn in this semester , five of which are compulsory and the remaining one is optional .
However , I have n't decided which optional module I 'm going to take without having a brief understanding .
I attended my German course today . There were just four students , Tress , Turk and I , attending class because X - mas is coming .
My teacher is an amusing guy . He asked Turk to teach us Turkish , and asked me to teach them Chinese .
BTW , they thought that Chinese is really difficult because it is very different from Western languages such as Latin or German .
After the class , I bought a bottle of local wine ( a kind of sparkling white wine which has low alcoholic strength ) in order to celebrate X - mas .
: - ) This is my first time to celebrate X - mas in a foreign country .
I hope I will have a good time .
And merry X - mas to everybody !
I hope we all have a good time !
Diary 2011 / 8 / 25
I went on a tour of the programming camp to be introduced to acquaintances .
The purpose of this camp is to develop an apps related to SNS by two months .
And , it was the middle presentation day today .
Hokkaido Pollock
Today , I offered Hokkaido pollock to our Chinese client .
The price of pollock is very cheap now ,
because Japan has a large quantity of pollock , but the market is small .
My Chinese client will sell the pollock to the Chinese market .
Wish he will have success !
A very interesting thing is that most members usually drive the same brand of car except this year ,
the car type and generation are different .
The annoying thing is that Taipei always has traffic congestion on Friday nights .
I live in Korea and Iam a university student .
I am in the basketball team in my university .
My team 's name is MECA
In my university , myteam is verystrong and famous .
Yesterday , we had a tournament but unfortunately we were n't able to win .
Oh my god ~ I am discouraged from theresult
Besides , I made many mistakes in theplay .
As soon as I entered thepub , I drank soju ( korean alcohol ) .
My team members and I decided that
in the next tournament we will become champions .
I went to see Transformers Dark of the Moon in 3D this morning .
I 've seen the rest of the Transformers 's series and I was also looking forward to seeing it .
The movie was filmed using 3D cameras for the first time .
Thus effects in 3D format were awesome and very natural .
The battle scenes had power and I was very excited .
I thought that the movie was the most effective 3D format movie that I have seen .
I saw the caption version of the movie .
If I could perfectly understand the English conversations in the movie , I would not have read the captions .
But I needed to read the captions haha .
The 3D format made my eyes tired , especially from reading the captions .
I wish that I could have enjoyed seeing the movie without Japanese captions .
School Life in Paris
it 's been very good so far .
People here do n't speak any Asian languages of course , which is good for me because I primarily speak English and secondarily French here .
I think I 've forgotten a lot of words in Japanese .
yeah I 'm doing well haha .
Is it part of the culture or a personal problem ?
But anyways , I still have a lot of improving to do in English .
I can deal with normal conversations but when it comes to business English , it turns out to be very difficult which I think is the same thing in any language .
We have Chinese characters , Romaji which is the same thing that English speaking people use , Katakana is mostly used to describe foreign words , and Hiragana which is a Japanese phonetic language .
I want to learn more languages like Spanish , Portuguese , etc .
She added that the purpose of the proposed price hike is to protect the health of the smoker .
Including two women in their early twenties .
About 10 % of the people in our office are smokers .
And then the `` no - smoking `` rule became common in our field .
Well , that 's nice and full of sunshine and sweet smiles .
All the beautiful things depressed me .
In fact , I am currently studying under the English department in college , but I want to have more chances to practice my English .
I have some problems in spelling the words right ; I usually forget how to spell them or lose some letters while spelling them .
After graduating from college , I want to go to France to study for my Master 's degree .
However , I just heard that French is extremly diffcult . . . . .
I hope I can overcome it .
Oh by the way , I also have some problems in grammar about the words `` hope `` and `` if `` .
Green Green / Green Curtain
I dropped in at the laundry first , and started to walk ( around ) .
Do they really help us cut our energy use ?
As I wrote in my past diary / entry , we set the radio ( s ) on all day in my office , and I heard on the radio that growing a green curtains is one of the way to conserve / cut energy .
The following was what I learned about green curtains on the radio :
Green curtains protect us from the sunlight coming directly in our rooms during daytime . This will make you feel like setting your air - condition 's preset temperature not very low .
Since its about business , you ca n't rely on things that are risky .
First Diary
I washed the clothes and cleaned the room all day .
I 'm glad that my salary day is in 2 days .
I 'm going to go to the UK tomorrow !
These days I hardly write my journal in English because I am so busy .
My mother and I joined the ( safety and boring ) tour , but on the last day we have half a day of free time .
We will leave the tour after sightseeing at the house of parliament in London .
She also wants to go to the `` Tower of London `` before we go to Oxford .
We can not go there once a week or anything even though we love the UK so much .
I want her to go everywhere she wants to as much as possible .
I will write another entry after I go back to Japan : )
I caught a female beetle on my way home from the office despite that there are not many trees around here .
I have n't seen one for a long time , so I was happy .
I have started to write in my diary .
I decided to go to the bed early .
I have finished two tasks for now .
I 'm taking a break to listen to music and drink a cup of coffee .
Which singers do you like ?
Hawaii has many places to see , swim and foods to eat .
I am excited about going there .
What places do you recommend ?
I went to my friend 's house .
I got on the train from neaby subway station to the end of the line , and walked to my friend 's house .
I had n't an umbrella .
I decided to run to there , but the rain was getting strong .
It 's rainy season in Japan now , but it is n't raining these days , so I do n't have to bring an umbrella .
Because I love to eat Japanese food .
I like spicy food such as kimche that is Kolean food .
It contains lots of red chilies
It effects for excitometabolic .
Of course , I even like to eat fast food such as Mcdonalds .
The reason why is it 's save time and money !
I manage a homepage as one of my hobbies .
About 40 - 100 people visit my website everyday .
Whenever someone clicks this advertisement article , Google gives me 20 - 30 yen .
The advertisements content is automatically related to the contents of my website .
About 5 people click these everyday .
It seems that I can get 100yen per day ( \ 3000 / M , \ 36000 / Y ) .
But , I have n't enjoyed it so far .
I was extremely busy this week because there were problems at my job .
It will run over one year in two weeks , however a software problem was found last week .
So I had to work , fixing bugs for free even though the software was n't made by me .
This is because the people who made it quit our company last month .
And if it had occurred 2 weeks later I could have earned some money .
What bad timing !
can anybody tell me which one of the following usages is correct ? ?
`` I got you to wait . `` ( correct ) : D
`` I had you wait . `` ( correct again )
thanks for reading this entry , you all have a great day ! !
Could you tell me how to use them using sentences .
In Japan , a sad incident ocuured .
Shinsuke Shimada , who is a very popular TV personality , withdrew from the world of entertainment because it was found out ( discovered ) that he had relations with the Japanese mafia in the past .
I liked him because his talks were very light and very interesting .
His talk attracts people 's minds .
I am very sad thinking that I 'll never again see him on TV .
This Is My First English Entry
This is my first English diary / journal entry , and it is not well - written .
But I still want to write it , because maybe I can have a good experience .
This is my hope in my sophomore year at university .
Today I want to continue my entry from yesterday , by writing a little bit about the requirement that I must meet in order to be admitted to a university in Denmark .
So , this will be the first major difficulty , because I estimate that my English level right now is around the B2 / C1 European standard level . Within a year , I need to reach the C2 level in order to pass the Toefl with excellent scores .
I will finish high school in June 2013 , but if I want to apply for a Danish university I need to present my application by March 2013 , so I do n't know if they will require the certification that I wo n't have until June .
I do n't want to wait an entire year before attending the university in 2014 , so next year I 'll try to contact the university to get / obtain some information .
But I 'll have to learn Danish to go to the grocery store or places like that , I guess .
I 'll see in the future . . . .
I have 1 year still to decide on what to do , even though I 'm pretty sure about going to Denmark .
I 'll watch a movie .
I 'll eat at a restaurant in the department store .
I 'm the only one at home .
Are you interested in Android ?
And I 'm studying hard to learn it .
Android has been talked about a lot in Japan recently .
However , almost all of the information about Android is in English .
English is necessary to write a good Android application .
This is one reason that I study English .
In this country there are a bunch of racists .
I understand when some people say some racist comments to me because they and I are friends .
However , I still like it here .
I wish I could speak fluently in English and make friends with them as American people do with each other .
Yesterday and the day before yesterday I worked at a part time job .
I ca n't explain the details of the work , but it was really effortless .
Incidentally , I 'm enrolled in a temporary employment agency .
The work from yesterday and the day before ( yesterday ) was for / from that agency .
The hourly wage is $ 10 .
Last night after work I went out to dinner with my best friend .
After eating , we stopped at a bookstore near the restaurant .
At the Bookstore we ran into my friend from high school .
He is also interested in studying abroad , so we talked ( about this topic ) for some time .
I have only a few friends who understand my desire to study abroad .
I have a better appreciation for my friends now .
It opens on the first Sunday every month , this is the first time I have visisted .
A huge amount of people and a mountain of goods were there .
Nice to meet you !
I 'm studying English ; especially writing and speaking .
Today 's plan
I 'm going to lunch and Karaoke with my friend ,
but first , I will go to Starbucks .
I like going to a coffee shop in the morning .
I read books , write daily and study English in there .
Do you have a favorite place ?
Foreigner ca n't understand only words .
It is a place where you can see the Tokyo Tower and is very beautiful .
I went to Roppongi after the New Year 's count down .
Have you heard of Charo ?
The dog 's story is broadcast by NHK radio and an English course on TV .
There is a small path named `` Omoide - Yokocho `` in the western side of Shinjuku Station .
The path and bars have Showa Retro Style , it looks like it has not changed for long time from Showa era .
It was my first visit from this old bar .
We enjoyed drinking some beer and other drinks and eating yakitoris with very reasonable price .
I watched Hakone Ekiden , which is the most famous long - distance race in Japan , and was broadcasted on TV for 2 days from the 2nd of January .
I have been watching this race without fail every year since I was an elementary student .
I am attracted to this race .
First , this race has a long history .
This race has been done every year for 85 years .
That is , this race has been taking place annually for 85 years .
This race is done by University students in the Kanto region .
For instance , the students put in much effort to participate in this race .
Some runners give up without finishing the race due to extreme dehydration and low blood sugar .
Yes , this race is difficult because runners run almost 20 km .
Especially , this race is separated 10 sections between Otemachi , Tokyo and Hakone ( 5 sections for one way ) , and runners must run 850 meter above sea level in the 5th section .
That 's why nobody knows what will happen .
And the reason why I am so attracted to this race is that the runner 's perseverance encourage me to persevere no matter what happens .
I could receive a lot of inspiration / encouragement and courage .
It 's been a long time since I wrote a diary about my ex - girlfriend 's wedding .
I just came here to see what 's new here , not to write ,
but when I read the diary about my ex - girlfriend , I decided to update my diary ,
becuase I fell in love with another woman .
I met her 5 months ago at work .
She was just a co - worker at first .
I started my job last year but there are lots of reason that I 'm thinking about this .
I intended to go to a graduate school after graduating from university .
The company that I 'm working for is little bit strange , for example even we have to work overtime we do n't get paid . . . .
there are lots of other examples
Griping and complaining does n't change the situation and anyway I need to work before going back to school to pay for tuition
So I thought that changing my job is one of several choices .
One of my friends has already had job interviews and he told me what he was asked .
There was a question that made him really embarrassed , which was ' ' What is your strong point ? ? ' '
I think we know what we like or what we are interested in , but if someone asked me ' ' what is your strong point ? ? ' '
I 'm not sure if I could answer soon or not .
I was brought up in Busan .
I really love learning foreign languages and I also love traveling to meet people around the world .
Ju - hee ( interviewee ) : I 'm good at consulting with unique people . I 'm also good in meetings .
Also , I have leadership skills and a strong mind .
I have developed myself through group activities in our school and I do a good job on it
Ju - hee ( interviewee ) : I think a flight attendant should be positive , responsible , and can easily adapt in any situation because they meet various international people in many different situations .
they should treat them equally
Also they should realize their actions quickly and calmly and then , try to control the problems .
I think passengers will be releived by this behavior , and professional performance .
Please sign up here .
I will post the papers later .
I 'll never forget when my dancing teacher asked me an important question when I was 17 years old .
I had joined dance club when I was a senior , but it was very difficult for me as a new learner ; no matter the poses or tempos , I was such as a dork . . .
My teacher have asked me , `` Why have you come here ? ``
I did n't answer him , because I knew that he just wanted to remind me that I should be serious about dancing , and not be worried about anyone else 's opinion .
I have since been learning dancing for 4 years , and hopefully one day people will ask me , `` Are you a teacher ? ``
`` , not just `` Are you a dancer ?
``
Once , when I danced in a nightclub , a ballroom dance instructor asked me , `` Why do you want to learn dancing ?
Do you want to become a teacher in the future ? ``
I 'll keep learning dancing forever .
I find that it 's easier to say something I feel embarrassed about in English than in Mandarin .
The above has nothing to do with this journal entry I am going to write .
What I want to say is , I think I should stop hiding my feelings .
I am absolutely an honest woman , however , my nature is to hide my own feelings .
Also he is very smart and good at architecture and history .
I really like to go to his class , however , I always keep silent because I am afraid he will criticize what I say .
And I am going to stay in Hsinchu , so I am afraid that I wo n't meet such an excellent teacher .
And then I told him I talk to my parents everyday too , but I seldom tell them what I did .
3 ) I am straight , but I feel more comfortable talking to women .
And I feel it 's easier for me to make friends with women .
I am the kind of person who will pretend to be careless when I meet the guy I like .
Today is my friend 's birthday .
So I wanted to send an e - mail to say Happy Birthday , at exactly 12 : 00 .
But I was so tired yesterday that I could n't send it .
I was asleep . So very shocking > <
After school , I went to a shopping center to study .
I studied alone until 15 : 00 , then Kattuchan , who is my boyfriend , came . He and I studied together till 22 : 00 . We talked a little . I was happy .
But , now I 'm tired . . . > <
To spank or not to spank ?
We can speak to them and teach them what is wrong and what is right and in the long term that will be more effective than hitting them .
I totally agree with this .
And that 's what a good society is , one that can embrace a minority . ( or : minorities )
I agree with this .
Trouble is kind of a trademark of children .
Children are not children anymore if they know how to behave and never make mistakes , I think .
It 's natural that parents face all kinds of trouble when raising their children so it 's nice if parents can understand and enjoy the trouble that children make . ( or : cause )
What Do You Think About Learning Other Languages ?
Do you think the ability to master other languages is related to the learners ' age ?
I 'm sure that people can master other languages regardless of their age .
However , it takes a little bit longer for older people to master other languages , compared to young people .
I think that the most important thing about mastering other languages is to maintain a high level of motivation .
Because we ca n't handle other languages like native speakers .
However , it is very valuable for us to take our whole lives to master other languages .
I remember that is how my daughter learned Japanese .
When she was a baby , I always tried to speak to her with simple Japanese phrases , and she watched Japanese TV shows for kids every day .
I also read a bunch of books in Japanese to her .
That means she grew up with Japanese language circumstances .
Therefore , If I could do what babies do to learn their mother tongues , I would be able to master English .
I 've heard that human beings use only 10 percent of their brains .
We do n't use ninety percent of our brains .
I think it is really a waste to not to use the whole of our brains .
I 'm sure that we must have extra room to remember other languages
I want to believe that I can master English , if I do n't chose the wrong way to learn .
I would love to maintain a high motivation ; I also want to put myself into circumstances where I must use English .
I have to go to university now .
Goodbye .
So I 've not been snowboarding yet .
I wonder if I should go snowboarding next week .
Is American English pronunciation different from British English one ?
I do n't know whether English speakers know there are 4 kinds of English pronunciations in toeic test .
Certainly I can barely perceive those differences , as for me it 's trifling .
At the same time , I wonder how native speakers feel and think of those differences .
Sometimes I heard British is proud of their ORIGINAL ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION , and some English claim American English pronunciation is NOT formal .
By the way , I have been studing American English ( I mean , I use CNN in spite of BBC as learning materials and so forth ) So I am used to hear American English .
I often feel that both are the same .
I found this movie trailer out in Apple trailers site .
`` The Scientist `` became interesting to me as soon as I saw its trailer .
Woman : So , What do you think happens when you die ?
Man : That 's just your body .
I felt a little bit cold at first but warmed up after playing .
One of my colleagues , who is over 50 , is very tough because he usually plays tennis after work .
I completely lose to him in terms of stamina .
I feel that it is important to exercise regularly .
When I read your email , I took my mom out to dinner that night .
She was pretty that night .
We went to have Japanese bbq at Causeway Bay .
Athough we always ( have ) dinner with her , but it ` s the first time I have formally invited her .
This was very special for us .
Let me share some photos with you .
We must teach each other to be humble .
We have to be humble , even if we are told to be so , when we recognize the fact that we have flaws , and little power .
Long time , no see .
I 'm a student at the University of Ritsumeikan in Japan .
I 've studied English since junior high school .
The reason why I 'm learning English is to go study abroad .
I 'm majoring in Robotic engineering , so I want to study about robotics and share with those who are studying robotics all over the world about my information , knowledge and ideas and so on .
Because of that , I 'm trying to increase my experience in English as much as possible everyday .
My hobby is watching action and science fiction movies .
My favorite movie is `` Back to the Future `` .
I also like listening to music .
I love BoA and Taylor Swift .
One more thing , I 'm interested in travelling .
Every time I visit another country , I can experience other cultures and meet people who are different from my country .
Everything is seems so fresh .
If you find any mistakes in my journal ,
please correct me .
There was an earthquake .
It was said that a big earthquake will happen in the near future in Yokohama .
I went to a basketball get - together ,
but I was just looking , as usual .
I want to get better ASAP .
To do so , I have to work harder on doing reheb .
Today , I ate some tako - yaki .
Tako is octopus in English , tako - yaki is a piece of octopus coated with flour and grilled into a ball .
I love seafood , particularly shrimp and octopus .
So , I 'd like to try to eat a variety of seafood dishes ( from ) all over the world .
My friend , Min came from Thailand 3 years ago .
She and I have been friends since this April at the cooking school .
Sometimes she teaches me Thai , but I would look at the words , they all looked the same .
But I know that language has rules of use .
Nothing is impossible
A presentation schedule has been fixed for next week .
I will give a presentation for my new client in English .
It will be first time that I give a presentation for a `` new client `` .
I need to make careful preparations for the upcoming day .
I 'm very nervous , but also curious .
When I arrived in Kyoto , I saw a lot of modern buildings .
I thought `` Where are the old temples ? ? ? ``
`` This city is not that different from my town . . . ``
But walking around the city , I found there were many temples and shrines there .
I thought if I could live there , then I could take a lot of pics .
Today I logged in to check if I have got any messages .
Later I helped two friends to correct their Chinese writing .
I hope we all can participate in this activity and share happiness or sorrow with others .
The movie was Fast & Furious 4 .
In the end , this film did n't disappoint me .
This morning I was scared of being called to the board for an oral test , but no teachers did .
Yesterday I bought a new cell phone .
It 's an HTC Hero .
I think it 's just good PR .
Why do you love your iPhone ?
This week I had such a hard time
I am looking forward to going there
I want to introduce myself but I do n't know what to say .
He thought I was being modest .
But actually I was trying to be honest .
Now I am reading some books about Psychology .
: p ^ ^
I hope that it will be sunny ! !
From Hokkaido to Okinawa , the weather is bad .
Japanese call it ` Akisame Zensen ` . . . .
I stopped my car as fast as I could , and I was narrowly able to avoid running him over .
He must have had something wrong with his brain , probably because of his old age .
It looks like it will be nice weather today .
To do listTo do list :
* Do experiment ( changing the medium )
* Create documents with Power Point about diabetes , especially the insulin effect mechanism
I did ' nt have time to eat , as I woke up late .
Anyway , I 'm still wondering when my English will get better .
We went shopping .
It is very cute !
It is small and to get there , you have to travel for 30 minutes by boat .
There are a lot of beaches , where the people go to swim , walk or surf .
There are a lot of surfers in the sea beacuse there are good waves .
It is very relaxing and everywhere is very clean .
On the coast there are a lot of different kinds of restaurant .
You can see some fantastic things on this island !
I went to friend 's house by subway .
The New York subway system was complex .
However , it was a good experience .
At that time , I also took a day trip to Canada .
I drove about 4000 miles by car .
I want to visit the US again .
I plan to drive to New York from Las Vegas .
I 'm a Japanese guy in London .
Though I 've been here six months , I still have questions which are not quite clear to me .
I think it 's not an exaggeration to say Japanese service businesses have highest qualities in the world .
Trains and busses in Tokyo hardly ever cancel their service on the way .
Trains run every 2 minutes following a timetable and if train is late for more than 5 minuites , we can get a refund .
I have n't taken a shower with cold water because showers have n't broken and if it 's broken a repairman comes and fixes it that day .
There are chain restaurant whose types of foods are n't so different from those at Macdonalds .
We can cancel mobile contracts through the internet 24 hours .
We can reserve the day we cancel mobile contracts .
Thus , all Japanese people have to adapt to inconveniences .
Plus , London 's outdated service is common subject for us .
Why is London inconvenient , though it is in advanced country and is an economic capital of the world ?
I found an interesting website about some common writing mistakes with English grammar that native speakers make frequently .
It 's obvious that those words are very close in both pronunciation and meaning to each other and this makes it hard for native speakers to tell them apart when it comes to writing .
If anything , common mistakes Japanese people would make would be with articles , countable nouns , and tense .
I received my office test along with my co - workers today .
It is important to me ; _ the test is for my promotion in the office .
The passing score is 60 points .
I 'm really tired due to the test , _ so I 'm going to bed !
How was your day ?
For me , not good .
It is because there are many people who speak English very well in my English academy .
A free club is free of charge class for students .
In today 's free club , we discussed about Honduras ' problem .
We made groups of 4 guys in each group to talk about it .
But me and a girl hardly spoke .
After that time , I had a diffidence .
It 's as if my high confidence became low .
Can you give me consolation ?
Shizuoka is well - known for / popular thanks to Mount Fuji ( Fujisan ) and green tea .
I used to look out at it during a boring class .
Green tea is the one of the famous Japanese drinks in the world , I think .
Shizuoka is the prefecture with the highest consumption of green tea in Japan .
We Shizuoka people / People in Shizuoka drink green tea every day after lunch .
Unfortunately , Shizuoka is not good for sightseeing like Kyoto or Tokyo .
However it 's the one of the best places to live in Japan .
We can get to Tokyo or Nagoya within an hour by express train ( Shinkansen ) .
Almost everybody here is kind .
I 've started using Twitter .
I 'm not sure about how to use it very well yet .
Also on Twitter , I 'll tweet only in English to improve my language skill .
Has anyone registered for it ?
I yearn after them , because they have blond hair , and blue or brown eyes , and high noses , and they have very good style .
I think they are very nice .
I want to be good at speaking English , because I want to I talk with them and become friendly with them .
However , I can not study talking or hearing .
Where should I go to meet with them here ?
It seems these past two days have been nice and warm .
This image is , as you can see , a rough drawing .
I ca n't remember if it is the one used in the work .
Animators draw not only people , but also smoke and other natural phenomenon .
Most animators do n't like drawing natural phenomenon .
There is a name for a person who likes drawing natural phenomenon .
They are called `` effect animators `` in Japan .
The bride was so beautiful and I wish I would be like her one day .
Well , I will just hope .
There is a park between the nearest train station and the hospital he is in .
It was raining heavily , and I was listening to music on full volume .
While I was walking through the park , somehow my wallet fell out of my pocket .
When I realized , I broke out in a cold sweat .
There were some cash cards , credit cards , my driver license , and other stuff in it !
But my wallet was taken to the police station by a kind gentlemen !
Somehow the police officer remembered it .
In order to practice English , I think it would be better if I used both English and Japanese in my blog .
Although I do not think that there are many people visiting my blog .
I have spent all of my effort learning Japanese .
But , now I am the fourth grade in college , and I want to find some work after I graduate .
When comparing English and Japanese , I like Japanese better than English .
Okay , I am going to listen to an English drama first , starting with `` Friends `` .
But I don ` t like waiting only .
I always try to take an action to strike it rich in my life .
This is my first diary entry / journal entry .
Last weekend , I went to the city of Bath in the UK .
Interestingly enough , Bath is the root of the English word `` bath `` .
Actually , there is an old hot spring bath made by the ancient Romans in Bath .
I wanted to go in the old bath , but it was not possible because it is to be protected as a heritage site .
There were also Christmas markets in Bath .
Christmas markets seem to be a culture from the European continent .
There were many small shops in an open space near a big church .
I ate Yosenabe , and now I am full and sleepy .
First , the change in his attitudes about the Constitution allowed Douglass to take part in politics .
Garrisonians took up a nonvoting policy because they thought that the politics in the United States was already corrupt and that participating in it would degrade themselves .
The Constitution was the basis of politics in this country , and , therefore , there was no way for Douglass to get involved in it as long as he denied the Constitution .
Although the speeches and writings that he made during the Garrisonian era impressed a lot of people , it did not give any pragmatic power to Douglass to abolish slavery .
On the other hand , in politics , once you could appeal to a numbers of voters , you could actually change the society through elections and through policies in Congress .
The town is very small , but is known for its traditional cityscape , where I could see beautiful antique gas lamps standing along stone streets and some buildings which had been built about 100 years ago .
What 's more , I could feel the great nature because the town was surrounded by mountains beginning to turn red and yellow .
There , I bought grilled squid , some fried chicken and potatoes , a stick of banana with chocolate , two candy apples and a candy grape , four Taiyakis and an Okonomiyaki .
It was good to watch some traditional dances , which were performed by students of the town school , while eating these foods .
I enjoyed the food , the nature and the festivity of the small town very much .
Yesterday 's diary
Yesterday , I read an article from the company mail .
I find that it 's easy to read the article but I ca n't write one .
On some days , I do n't login onto Lang - 8 .
I like to read article people have written .
I like English and I like Japanese
but I prefer Chinese .
Now a days , We can exchange fireworks with other items at street stalls .
My friends get them and use the fireworks .
By the way , you may already know that we have a problem at Fukushima in Japan .
That problem is very big and ongoing , so there is a self - control atmosphere now .
Many fireworks festivals have been cancelled this year .
If grilled chickens smell good , what can I say ?
Is the chicken savory or fragrant ?
Today , we had English class .
Miss Gan gave us a test on translation .
But we did badly .
First of all , our vocabulary is poor .
We can not use the exact words ( we would like ) to express ourselves . hat 's more In addition to that , most of the grammar we learned in high school has been forgotten .
So our English has gotten worse .
I can only use simple words .
That 's terrible
I can write but talking is my main problem . My friends are Japanese . Have a great Christmas . Javi
Today , In the morning I went to work and then in the evening I went drinking with my friend .
It 's been a long awhile since the last time I went drinking , so , I got drunk so soon .
I 'm likely to fall asleep any moment .
Tomorrow , I have to work from 10 to 23 , so I 'll go to bed now .
It has been a long time since the last time I visited this website .
I hope that I can improve my English writing skill by keeping a journal here .
I belong to Unbalance , which is one of the clubs in my college .
It is a club that plays many sports such as volleyball , badminton , futsal , basketball and so on .
The club meets every Friday .
We picked teams and both teams fought to win .
My team ended up losing , but we enjoyed the game .
Even though a lot of people say Unbalance is a funny name , I like this club !
And this website asks me everyday whether I have achieved my goals or not .
I just wanted to write something .
But I think that maintaining the habit is more important than writing long entries sometimes .
( This is NOT my excuse for not posting for the past ten days or so . . . ) I thought I would write some sentences like I 've been doing but I noticed that I 'd already written enough .
OK , I will make it a rule to write something down everyday for real ! !
To be continued tomorrow ! !
Lang - 8 has made me a lot of friends
I have a lot of friends from Lang - 8 .
I used to talk to some of them on Skype ; I was really hapy to havea relationship with them .
All of my friends are really nice and kind .
They teach me English when I have a question and do n't understand something .
They gave me the power to study English . They would cheer me up and make me feel warm inside . I will now read a book and comeback to use my computer again .
The Disadvantages of Using Cars 1 . Please correct . Thank you ! !
Although there are some opinions that cars have many profits , I think that they have had a greater negative impact on various things than a beneficial impact .
There are two reasons : harming the environment and decreasing a chance of communication .
The first reason is the environment being harmed by exhaust gases .
The exhaust gases from cars affect the environment in various negative ways .
Carbon dioxide gas and NOx gas , which is a group of nitrogeneous oxide , are some of the gases .
In addition , various living things / species of animals and insects are becoming extinct .
For example , one of the species of Ogasawara butterfly , which only lives on the Ogasawara islands in Japan died out because of climate change .
The second reason is a decrease in opportunities for communication .
The unexpected meeting may be an enjoyable time for you and make your travelling more fun .
So you had better not use cars , but take a train , bus , and other kinds of public transport for travel .
Many people enjoy using cars for shopping , travelling , of couse , driving .
But I think it is unprofitable for us to continue using them .
It is the start of the rainy season in Japan .
I hope the weather will get better soon .
Today I am in Sapporo on Business .
It is very cold and it 's snowing .
The food is delicious though .
At that time , I was in china for my business trip .
The adrenalin and the feeling of you are in the middle of the field , fighting for your life - even in a battle simulation - gives you a new level of confidence and power !
Yes , I know , Pantera was a damn good band and if you understood this reference I must tell you that you have great musical taste !
But , back to the point / topic , I play Paintball for pure pleasure .
I joined a group of friends who play together on Sundays in order to `` kill `` and `` be killed `` by paintball shot by colleagues just to increase their weekly pressure .
So , in the end , everybody goes home , happy and with a smile on their faces .
It 's quite different from the standard Paintball in most part to its rules and military characteristics like tactics , strategies , missions and moves .
If I would recommend a foreign visitor who has only one day to spend in my country ,
for the following two reasons , I think he or she should go to Akihabara .
One is that he or she can buy a lot of new and unusual electrical appliances .
There are more than 50 electrical appliance shops which display and sell various items quickly in Akihabara .
For example , I went to Akihabara last Sunday ( in order ) to buy an electric cord .
At first , I only planned to buy that cord
But when I looked around in a few shops , I wanted to buy some other new and rare items such as the iPhone 4 which went on sale a few months ago , some red lights that are used in police cars , and animation DVDs of dolls .
As a result I bought everything except an electric cord .
The other reason is that we can see original Japanese subcultures like those for comic books , animations , and games .
There are a lot of them in Akihabara because the electrical appliance shops sell them .
For instance , when I went to buy a game for the PlayStation , I could see some people who were wearing the costumes that the game characters wear .
They are called cosplayers , they wear costumes and go to Akihabara every weekend .
Such people can only be seen in Akihabara .
In conclusion , I would suggest that a foreign visitor who has only one day to spend in my country should go to Akihabara .
Whenever I go there , I enjoy buying new and unusual products and watching the cosplayers .
When I arrived at home ( it was usually around 6 : 30 p .
m ) , my son and I took a bath right away .
Then , I served dishes as I had prepared them the day before .
Then , I did the rest of the / my household chores , took care of my son etc . . . . . . . . . . .
This week might be as busy as I was a single . . . . ( a single ? )
Although he is well known as a singer - songwriter , I love the way he plays guitar .
The sound of his guitar is as natural as his voice .
I was far more impressed with his guitar play rather than his singing .
And I have a similar impression of Bob Marley , the most famous Jamaican
Both these great singer - songwriters played the guitar just like their supreme singing .
My Amazon Kindle has arrived .
My Amazon Kindle arrived this morning .
I am quite disappointed .
This was my first impression .
I bought it especially to read free e - books about e - business .
It has problems with the PDF format .
When I convert a PDF file to Amazon 's format , it doesnt 't look good .
I bought a book called the 4 - hour week from Amazon and I am impressed with the speed of the buying process
This is actually one - click buy .
I hope that when I will come to know the Kindle better , I will become pleased with my purchase .
I am not a book lover at all .
Maybe I should have bought a tablet instead of an e - book reader ?
I 'll try to write a small review of the Amazon Kindle on my blog .
In the recent days , there are many people recording videos on the snow here .
So , this time , I made a movie about white scenery .
And I uploaded it in my blog .
I want to send this movie to people who are reading my blog .
I 'll try to finishthe next movie tonight !
A new term began two weeks ago .
My classmates study very hard .
I feel so tired now .
But I will work harder .
Everybody , please support me !
Today , I will talk about a hobby of mine :
My hobby is taking pictures .
I 'd really like to get a single - lens reflex camera .
But I do n't have cameras .
So I always take pictures with my cell phone .
Single - lens reflex cameras have a lot of great features
and there are two reasons why I want one .
Second , is that the image qualities are better than digital cameras preeminently .
I want to take pictures about a crowbar field on a rainy day .
I think it takes such beautiful pictures because of color contrast .
I have seen that scene once , and it was wonderful .
I 'll never forget it .
I take alot of landscape pictures ;
Sometimes flowers that are blooming in my garden , sometimes a fallen leaf that has fallen on the road , and sometimes the sky . And that is not it at all .
Also , I do not like pictures of people as much .
There are WABI and SABI in Japan , and I think Japanese do not like landscapes with people , like me .
Actually , I 'd rather see just one person in a photograph than many people .
Because of need not being necessary to speak forcibly the nature is easy . ( ? )
I bought a hair pin with a flower .
Anyway , taking pictures is so fun .
It is because things seem to be different than normal according to passing the lens .
And because it helps you discover new things .
I have a cold
My nose wo n't stop running .
I also have a sore throat so I took some medicine
.
With the development of technology , the way of gaining information is not restricted to books anymore .
Various kinds of mass media were invented to accelerate the spread of knowledge , such as television and film .
Now I am going to analyze the advantages and disadvantages between books , television and film .
Books were considered as the only way of gaining acknowledge in the past and only certain groups of people like intellectuals and politicians could read them .
Even now , books still play a crucial role in academe .
for example , professors in university use books as the main teaching material and scientists record their findings in papers .
The accuracy of information from books is unquestioned , because the publishing of a book is through a serious process .
However , reading books is a passive way to receive information and there are not many people that have the patience to do it .
Compared to books , television has brought us an adventure of enjoyment of vision , which opened the door of information spreading .
According to a survey , people in Taiwan spend at least 2 hours everyday watching television at all ages which reveals that the attraction of television is irresistible .
There is no doubt that television has become a part of our lives because of its entertaining effect , so that TV has become as a way to spread information .
Nevertheless , television brings some negative effects like misleading audience and exaggerating situations for programming purposes .
Take for example , just because a person is mentally ill does n't mean that they are violent , but mental illness is easily connected with violence in some soap dramas .
Film is similar to television , but with more dramatic elements .
In my point of view , film targets entertainment rather than giving information .
Take the movie of Happy Feet for example , we all know that we are facing the problem of the greenhouse effect , but there are not many people that take it seriously .
After this movie , more and more people started to show concern about greenhouse effect .
But like TV , there is too much exaggeration for it to be good media .
In my opinion , I would say books are the most effective way of communicating information , even though books are not well accepted by everyone .
Television and film are absolutely the most accepted and well used media .
In terms of accuracy , I do think books are the most effective .
First of all , the food , drinks and tobacco were in a higher percentage than other items .
Ireland and Turkey were near 30 % , On the other hand , the rest of nations failed to reach 20 % .
Sweden , the lowest country , reached 5 . 4 % .
It was shown the different countries consumer spending were quite different .
Most of the books that I want to read are in English .
So , I started English study .
I hope I hope to continue this diary .
The flu is going around at work .
I work at an elementary school .
My co - worker has n't caught the flu even once .
She 's also been vaccinated every year .
She said that everything depended on how you looked at it .
Today , I had a conversation in English .
But I spoke very little .
She went to Hokkaido last weekendand then to explore nature .
If I could speak English , I would be able to communicate better .
Sometimes I feel bad about bothering you with my low - level English .
I think that it is good experience for me to talk in English .
And I enjoyed that conversation very much !
If someday I died . What would I regret ?
The first thing is : I never bought anything for my parents , nor thanked them .
Today , I will meet a college student who is looking for a job .
She is eager to research many kinds of jobs .
I want to help her by speaking about my experiences .
Fatty
Fatty was a very plump and obese guy when we were in senior high .
Nevertheless , he is very slender now .
Yesterday , I asked him if he is available this weekend to accompany me to look for language exchange .
He said , `` Sorry , I have to join a computer exhibition . ``
I replied to him , `` Oh ~ great !
what a nice show , you can absorb new knowledge of computers . ``
He responded to me , `` No , I just want to take some photos of showgirls . lol > . <
If someone dares to destroy my schedule , I swear I will slaughter him . ``
Wow ~ Fatty is so serious about it .
The first diary .
I am studying English today .
I can use English when I go for a trip .
Today I visited my friends who are my fellow English - lovers to have a meeting in English .
I like Japanese dishes , so I had been looking forward to visiting it .
To my sadness , one of our members was absent from today 's meeting because her son had a fever and she had to stay at home .
: D I thought I should have worn a kimono .
I very much enjoyed not only eating , but also seeing the artistic dishes served .
The above was made by his mother ( my wife , of course ) . : - )
I went to my friend 's shop today
I went to my friend 's shop today .
I had n't seen them in a long time .
I enjoyed a conversation with them .
The flood problem in Thailand is getting better now in some areas , but it is still critical in approximately 25 provinces .
The next problem for the Thai people may be a food shortage .
My English is very poor so I hope the things I write are just a story for other strangers .
suki - na shousetsuka wa Haruki Murakami desu .
One last thing : If I want to ask my friend where in Japan she used to live , can I say `` Nihon no doko ni sundeimashita ka `` ? That 's correct .
I got in touch with my friends in Hokkaido .
I 'm looking forward to going back to Hokkaido in August .
I 'm tired of eating everything I cook .
Can you recommend some good recipes ?
I really like this language and I hope to master it someday .
I think that the only way to learn a language for real is by using it with people who speak it everyday , that 's why I 'd really like to have some English and American friends who can help me to reach my goal .
I hope to meet new people through this wonderful and useful website !
Since I have traveled in Australia , I 'm becoming a lazy person .
I like to take pictures .
Because pictures remind me of my memories .
So I try to take a lot of pictures when I go to a new place .
Recently I ca n't take pictures .
Tomorrow I have to go some where . ^ ^
If you have not ( checked ) ( read ) my previous entry , I 'm not sure if you know that I 'm working in a nursing home for people with special needs .
After adding some sarcastic comments to the beginning of my entry this time , I will begin the story of the girl .
Today was the first time I met her and the last time for her to come to the nursing home .
Although I ca n't imagine what I will be doing next year , her mother said she might come ( back ) to the home next year .
I wondered how sad it would be if she had been living in that time .
I lost my balance and fell backwards .
I called forhelp from another staff member .
I did n't get what she was going to do to me , though I wondered if she wanted to get on me again , she tried to put her little foot on my thighs .
My second finger is still in pain .
It 's difficult to use a pen and others now .
From now on I have to be more careful on door .
my maternal grandmother had an operation because she suffered from gallstones .
my mother came back home when / while I was asleep .
I slept until 3 : 00pm because I ( had ) stayed up all night watching a soccer game .
I was glad that Manchester United beat Tottenham 3 : 0 .
it was worth staying up all night ( for ) .
So I saw movie at school .
It is a suspense movie that won an Academy Award a while ago .
I was lost in thought after watching it .
Now I want to read the original novel .
I sometimes ask my online friends about English although I know an English teacher among them is even useless .
I always end up solving my own problems or just ignoring them .
Unless you are well - trained or have a talent of language you can not teach other people your first language .
It 's not like rice cake , it 's a bread made of rice .
I really like one which I can buy in the nearest bakery .
I got up at 12 : 00 .
I just came from my parents ' home in Fukushima pref last night so I feel very tired .
I only had a three - day holiday and today is the Respect - for - the - Aged Day here in Japan .
I bought a present for my mother and etc at a shopping center near my house and ate beef tongue dish .
I wonder if foreign people eat beef tongue .
I had some yogurt and a ginger drink for brunch today .
I know it 's late for starting the day but that 's normal for me on my days off .
I am spent .
Recently I feel out of power .
When I went down to buy something for dinner , I still was n't feeling well because of my headache .
So I though what kinds of food may make me better , I recalled that banana can be helpful with your emotion , so I bought some dried banana flakes .
Then I bought two piece of bread from a baker .
While I was leaving the baker the hostess said `` good bye , handsome .
need something to drink ? `` I said `` no , thanks . `` Then my headache seemed to fade .
After that I bought some chocolate and a can of coconut juice in a supermarket and then went back to my room .
It 's very intersting ( interesting ) to know ( learn ) slang ( ) which is normally used by English speakers and I 'm very glad to meet a new and great people from around the world .
If you hate random chat services , I do n't recommend ( recommend ) it .
It 's kind of a practice ( for if I ) go overseas someday .
Maybe my wife is going to have a baby in a week .
I am going to be with her when she is in labor , and the time of the birth .
I am looking forward to the day of childbirth
I had something to do at the bank and the supermarket .
The only thing which makes me feel any better is talking to my girlfriend for a little while before going to bed .
It was after a long , long time .
I only did weight training , but it was too hard !
I have pain throughout my body because of it .
I got a E - mail from my friend who lives in the USA .
sorry bout bein late ! Sorry about being late !
Happy birthday ! ! ! !
I hope you have a nice birthday !
and I am really looking forward to seeing you sometime in the coming next couple of months .
I have a lot of things to tell you about !

Anyway , happy birthday sweet heart ! ( dear friend )
Today is a little bit cloudy .
I was surprised once again .
Outstanding ! ! !
Studying languages , preparing before I go to Canada . . and so on
I have no idea what I 'm talking about .
Anyway I have to cheer up !
See you guys : )
She was there on business and the earthquake struck a day before her departure back to Canada .
Actually , she would have left the day before , but because her plane had engine trouble , she had to stay there for one more night .
Luckily , she was staying in a modern hotel with earthquake resistance , so the damage to the building was minimal and she did n't lose the access to the Internet , through which we got to know she was okay .
A few days after she got home , she wrote an article about her experience .
Here it is :
This is my very first English diary . . .
This week I 've been relaxing , I went to Uni . , stayed home , ordinary days . . .
Tomorrow I 'm going clubbing in Kyoto !
There will be a party organized by `` Bape `` - the famous Japanese fashion brand - @ `` Club World `` in Koyoto .
Verbal ( m - flo ) and Nigo ( President of Bape ) will be there , Verbal is very nice and invited me . : ) yahooooo ! !
I 'm really excited and I 'm going to get ready to go to the party soon . . .
My thoughts .
So , I think the word is right that ' the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is a light ' < Proverbs 6 : 23 >
Today I went to a hair salon to have my hair cut and colored .
It has been while since I entered a university , and I 've decided to return my hair to black .
So when I look in the mirror ,
I feel strange . lol
By the way , which hair color do you prefer ?
Brown or black ?
Diet
My acquaintance gave me a big roll today .
I hesitated whether I should eat it or not because I 'm on a dietI 've been on a diet for three days .
Something but not empty in my heart
I was depressed today .
I was in my house all day and looking for what I could do for someone .
Doing that , I was at a loss cuz ( because ) I did n't find out what I really wanted to know .
I have to do a lot of things .
Exams are coming up soon .
But I wanna do what I really love to do .
I felt lonely .
Never never never give up .
Use my time efficiently !
Be strong !
Be ambitious !
Thank you .
Today is a fine and cool day .
Fall is coming .
I am going to be busy with work .
I 've got a lot of wonderful memories and spoke lots of English .
So my diary needs as much correcting as possible .
Even natives make mistakes , but I prefer to learn English nearly 90 % .
I 've got to ensure that I study hard .
Actually , during study abroad , I certainly studied more than enough .
But I wo n't stop learning .
I have just registered on Lang - 8 .
I 'm working at the Airport , so that 's why I have to be up so early .
I hope today wo n't be a busy day ( ^ _ ^ ; )
I thought the answer was ( a ) , but the answer is ( c ) .
Can you explain to me why the answer is ( c ) ?
When we speak and write in Japanese , we do n't often use the subject .
I study English now , I always use the subject when writing .
Does it need the subject in English ?
They drew a certain shape in black and white on the blank media .
I have never spun one before .
I could do it , but my son could n't .
I had been preparing for the exam for about 3 months .
I thought the exam would be easy as I had been prepared for it for a long time .
I still need to wait for the exam results .
I do n't feel like doing anything now .
I just want to catch up on my sleep and take a rest .
And I 'll start another essay on lang - 8 .
Health check !
In Japan , the university starts it 's new semester in spring .
All of them looked so happy .
I think they may be excited by a fresh place .
At the beginning of the semester , we check for our health conditions .
We check our height , weight , eyesight and blood pressure .
In last year 's health check , my height was 182 cm .
But in today 's check , it is 181 cm .
But the problem is my weight .
Though I weighed 68kg last year , today I weighed 72 kg .
I guess this gain came from a change in my lifestyle .
I bought a car last year , so I did not walk to go to my work place .
I must do my exercise for my health !
When I was in my teens , Japanese longed for American life , American films and American music .
The richest person in the world is not Bill Gates , just a Mexican guy .
The impressive sixth sense technology was invented by an Indian technologist .
We have to say hope for the best and prepare for the worst !
Then you are chaotically looking for direction .
I 'd like to lose weight .
I 'd like to lose a bit of weight .
I 'd like to have a smaller waist .
Because of this , I set aside time to exercise .
I 'm doing this because I 'm going on vacation soon and I 'll have to wear a bathingsuit ( swimsuit ) .
I hope I can lose weight before ( my / the ) vacation .
Today I went to swim . ( Ok )
But when I swim , I forget about these bad feelings .
I think I will go swim again sometime .
I have n't written in a diary since 2 month ago .
I went to Nagoya last week .
Yesterday I went out for dinner with my friends .
We ate fish .
Today I woke up at 10 .
Now I 'm going to a bathhouse .
I found them useful and worth buying .
But , the books ' prices were very expensive .
One was $ 13X .
Another one was $ 15X .
And the notebooks ' price was $ 30 x 4 in total .
The total was $ 4XX .
Fortunately , I have a VIP card , so I enjoyed a discount of 10 % .
I should have hit the ball more effectively . .
I have n't been here for a long time .
I do n't have time now because this year I have exams . . .
And much of my time is spent preparing for it . . .
It seems like just yesterday I started junior high school .
It 's the last year I 'm going to spend as a junior high school student , so I want to enjoy the rest of the day ( year ? ) .
Hello .
I 'm new to this SNS .
Thank you for reading this message .
Yesterday , I walked around my home because the weather was so good .
There are many cherry blossom trees near my home , so I watched them whilewalking slowly .
, its flowers do not live very long we are able to enjoy watching them for a little while / short amount of time .
Because of this I am sorry not to watch them till next spring , but I also think that it is the most ? beautiful of flower .
I broke up with my bf last night .
he said he would figure out what we or he should do from now ( he would figure out our relationship in the future the future for our relationship ) and tell me the next day .
but he never called me after that .
In the morning , I am going to the hair salon .
After lunch , I am going to buy a suit for the chorus competition .
I feel like buying a suit is cool .
I want to use andcherish it from now onward .
This is the first time I have logged into Lang - 8 .
I hope I can make lots of friends from every country .
I used to learn English , Japanese , and French .
Now ( comma not needed ) I 'm learning Korean ( comma not needed ) because I will travel to Korea in Oct this year .
I hope that I can overcome this problem before going to Korea .
I hope that I can make friend with everyone .
I often wonder . . .
I often wonder what is the meaning of life ?
I do n't think there exists a logically reasonable answer
I took the day off today .
Now , I 'm writing a journal after a long interval .
I started studying Chinese because it is neccesary for me now .
I often met the foreigners who do not learn the language even they stay the country for a long period .
I can imagine that Chinese characters are quite hard to understand for foreigners .
Fortunately it is easier to learn Chinese characters for Japanese , because we use them in our language .
We improted the Chinese characters to our language hundreds of years ago , and the meaning of most of the words are still the same .
We do n't understand each other when we speak , but can understand when we write .
( Ofcourse , Japanese do not understand all of Chinese characters , because they use much more characters than us . )
The pronunciation is so difficult , but I would like to keep trying !
When I moved here , I knew nobody . I want to make many friends .
I 'm lonely .
I wrote a letter in English for the first time in my life .
I wrote a letter today .
Is that right ?
Please explain it to me .
What about your father ?
What are your siblings doing ?
I do n't have any siblings .
Oh , I see .
Can you go to the park and play , now ?
Of course .
Good bye , see you at the park .
See you soon .
Studying English
I joined this site just now !
I am so happy to find such a nice site and what is more , it is FREE !
Today , I went to a Sport club ( is it right English ? ? ) as usaual .
I go to the club every Saturday to exercise and get rid of everyday stress .
I want to make friends with many people through this site .
OH , it is late at night . I will go to bed to keep in shape .
My friends and I are trying to go to bed before midnight .
Golden Week is over .
But I want to lose weight over the summer .
And tonight , I read the book ' You should do 17 things in twenties ' .
After reading it , I thoughtI must study English to fulfil my dream .
My dream is to Introduce our culture to people abroad ; anime , manga and so on .
Maybe it won ' tcome true until far in the future .
But , I decided to try .
Hi , everyone . How are you all ?
I just want to ask about the words `` odd ``
Actually , I know they mean .
But I need more examples of how these words are used in order to understand them better .
Thanks . ^ _ ^
Today I talked with a girl by chat .
She lives in US , and is studying to be a nurse .
She hates needles and blood ,
Then I listened to various things about her .
and her parents are not her real ones .
When she was three years old , her mother died .
Her father does n't need her now .
She was growing up with adopted parents .
She says that being alone is comfortable . . . . .
Her character is cheerful .
I think she will have a happy life .
I do n't know what to say . . .
She is impressive to me .
Because I 'm on the 7th month of my pregnancy .
My body feels heavy , but I have to work as usual .
I have a daughter who is 2 years old , so I have to look after her .
I wish to take a hot spring bath and then eat good food f at a Japanese - style hotel
Surely , it will make me feel relaxed .
I 'm very busy these days trying to find a job at a hospital .
I 've been trying to improve myself . .
, , Actually , I agree with them . . .
But I have confidence I can perform this job very well , if they would employ me .
Fortunately , I passed the 1st test at Korea University Medical Center .
The 2nd test is agroup interview so it 's more important than 1st test .
If I pass this last test , I can get a job at Severance hospital .
It has very good medical team , high tech medical devices , good service and very kind people .
Even though it 's not my first choice , I 'd take a job there .
I have been a mathematics tutor since 2005 .
Today , I have started to teach a student I taught two years ago .
Her grades are terrible so I ca n't sleep because I am worried about that very very much . . . .
How can I teach math to help her get better ?
She only has 90 days until the exam .
I wrote not long ago , because I got discouraged by learning English .
I 'm still at the same level and I ca n't learn any more .
Recently I had depression because I did n't see the meaning of life .
play pool
Yesterday I went to play pool .
It was the second time that I played .
The first time was in Nanxun ( URL ) .
I totally had no clue at that time and thought I would never play pool again .
But I made a lot of progress yesterday .
and I miss everyone .
so busy these days , I just want to say I 'm sorry .
Is there anyone who wants to Skype ?
Of course I will teach you Japanese as much as I can if you want to learn Japanese .
Anyway I have had a backache since I had a cold because I had to lay on my bed all day and I had high fever . .
Now the fever is gone , but backache is getting worse so I 'm not willing to go to school because I sit down on a terrible hard chair for at least 90 minutes .
Besides almost all professors only write the same as what is in the textbooks on the blackboard .
I want to graduate this university as early as I can , and I want to enter an other graduate school or get a job which has an oversea 's branch .
( It 's finally autumn here . )
Many people suffered from heat injury / stroke in Japan , this summer .
Hot summer was not only in Japan , but also in Europe .
I heard in news that many Russian people drowned because they were swimming in the river while drinking vodka to cool down .
Is this global warming effect ?
My workplace offered a healthcare course after five today .
I felt that it was fun but it is a little too hard for me .
I ate Chinese food .
It tasted yummy because it was free .
I was so relieved .
I forgot to bring a toothbrush .
Now , I am in the lab room .
School swot , searching for a job , and a part - time job . . .
But also there is something nice
A girl whom I wrote my 1st journal with gave me a call .
I have n't said that , because sheis in a relationship with another person .
he said `` I like you all of you `` .
So after that , I mailed her `` I know your kind heart and ability to chat sincerely `` .
I am so interested in the World Cup that will be held in South Africa just one year later .
Because I am Japanese , I hope Japan wins against other national teams and goes to at least the semi finals .
But when I watched the two qualifying games against Uzbekistan and Qatar , to enter the World cup , the reality seems different from what I hope .
Too bad , Japan would probably lose , and could not go to even round 16 .
This choice is not an efficient way to get a goal .
Japanese players have to learn how to use choices like dribble , pass or shoot based on the situation .
If there were more players like this in Japan , the possibilty to win in the World Cup would be a little higher .
Every shop was closed on Christmas day .
In Japan , this ( situation ) has never happened .
Unlike yesterday , many shops were having a sale and there were so many people in the city .
It felt like today is New Years Eve
In Japan , there is no difference between Christmas day and the 26th , which is the next day .
It is because shops give you a large discount before Christmas .
Actually , some shops in the city did not give me a big discount .
That does not mean anything to me .
But they usually sell them at the same price , and I am not sure that they are the real ones .
I am very brand conscious , especially with Japanese brands , so I do not usually buy anything here .
Did I buy anything then ?
( I was surprised that almost all the water was gone . )
I will go to Otford in the morning , walk to Bundeena and then stay there overnight .
This is one of my favorite quotes from ' Poor dad and Rich dad ' .
Let me introduce myself in English .
I often listen to music on the internet .
When I was young , I belonged to a brass band .
I 'm not particular about the name of the music , I just have fun with it .
I wonder where their sense of music comes from .
They are gifted musicians .
Teaching someone my mother language is fun .
I 'm not good at the grammar of my mother language , but at least I can judge whether it is natural or not .
In the spirit of a volunteer , I 'll correct wrong sentences as a native speaker .
I may be wrong sometimes , and if that happens , please forgive me .
I have realized that Japanese is difficult through ( my experience of ) teaching it to non - native speakers .
What is the right term when hospital patient is being discussed , `` patient 's condition `` or `` patient 's state `` ?
There are a lot of different symptoms , and a group of doctors are having a discussion . ( case conference )
Which of the two phrases above is correct in this case ?
It 's almost time for my husband to come home .
There is Chinese cabbage , spinach and Japanese radish in the fridge .
For meat , I have beef , chicken and pork .
What should I cook ?
I 'm not hungry , so I do n't feel like cooking now .
Now , my daughter is sucking on my toe !
English songs are filled with very native expressions , idioms and sometimes even stupid words .
This song have remained in my mind since the first time I came across it .
Especially , I 'm from ( living in ) Kyushu , South - Western Japan , which is near Korea
So , I recommend you to learn some Japanese phrases .
Personally , I want you to use `` Yokarou - mon ! ! `` , which means `` ( whatever it is , ) it 's good ! ! `` If you say this magical word , people in Kyushu will be more kind as usual . )
Of course , I like Euclid as the great mathematician .
Trouble - Maker
I am tolerant about my subordinate 's failures .
I am involved in several projects - that is , I have several bosses .
One of my bosses is a real trouble maker .
Every project member including me hates that my boss always causes trouble .
I went to watch the movie Harry Potter yesterday .
It was the last one of the Harry Potter series .
I enjoyed both the books and the movies in the Harry Potter series .
The main characters grew up over the years and throughout the series , the actors and actresses did too .
The last movie was interesting .
But if you are going to see the movie , it 's better to have read the original work before going to the cinema .
If you do that , it will be much more enjoyable .
Sunshine in my window
The sun shining in my window is very warm and it feels good but outside is very , very cold and windy .
can you guess what I 'm doing ?
How about you ?
I had to work very hard and I was busy everyday .
enjoy it with me .
I have gone through various things and everything was good for me and worked out , thanks to my friends , I 'm really thankful to them who have supported me to live in Arizona .
Chances are , you can not guess how stupid I am .
At least , I have had vocabulary more or less .
However even though I spoke with American people or International students , I could not clearly figure out what they said .
at that time , I had been feeling a huge sense of crisis and pressure .
A couple of days later , I started studying English quite hard , every time I finished the classes , I went to the library to study ; in addition to homework , I studied the grammar books which I had brought from Japan for a rainy day .
Actually it was a marvelous choice , or they could explain some of the grammar style plainly with Japanese .
what 's more , I have tried to avoid Japanese people in America .
I think that usually Japanese people who are going to university come here and are not eager to learn or study English in Arizona .
in addition , they always hang out with people from the same country ; in fact , I mean they are also Japanese .
Today is last day of May .
Next month is always the start of the rainy season ! ! !
I do n't like the rainy season . . .
because commuting by train becomes very hot and makes me feel bad ! !
But this year , I have good things ! !
My best friend will be getting married next month ! ! !
I 'm looking forward to my friend 's marriage ! !
He is very kind teacher because he always encourages students .
I like to make an effort !
I have n't written a journal entry for a long time , but decided to start again and write as many as possible this year !
However , I will try to use English as much as possible and even improve it .
Read newspapers
Therefore , I 'll read newspapers ( or `` a newspaper `` ) everyday if possible .
I do n't subscribe to any newspaper in my house , so I 'm going to the library to read it !
Go on a trip by myself
I 'll travel to somewhere in the world by myself !
I 'll take it seriously this year : ) As a starter , I 'm going to go buy a loud alarm clock today that will definitely wake me up !
Ceremony Decision !
I decided on a wedding center , this Monday .
I went to two wedding centers .
The first one was like a guest house and had a good atomosphere .
It is very convenient for me to work out a wedding plan here .
However , we wo n't be inviting company personnel , and the wedding is not too formal , either .
I think the hotel gets ( / holds ) a lot marriages per day .
Hence , the hotel staff do n't ( seem to ) have the time for just a pair .
Although , I am a bit relieved .
I was so excited .
I can use the comment function
that includes an explanation of Japanese honorific words .
I think that it would be very difficult for a person from another country to
understand Japanese honorific words .
Because even Japanese people ca n't use them correctly .
I want to do my best at it ( ^ O ^ ) /
I will introduce myself a little bit .
I 'm a marketer and director for web advertisement .
My husband was a systems engineer , but he quit his job last year and has been preparing to become a physical training instructor ( physical trainer ) .
I 'm a twin . I have a twin sister .
I also have a brother who is over three years old .
He and she ( They ) live in Tokyo .
My hobbies are cooking , reading , fashion coordinating , and riding a road bike .
Today I cooked Spaghetti Bolognese for lunch and baked a sea bream , tai [ ? ] with vegetables for dinner .
Do you know how to use paid holidays in Japan ?
My husband tore his Achilles ' tendon on the 9th of October , and he has n't been able to work for two weeks .
He asked his company what documents he would need to take his sick days
His boss answered , ' If you have paid holidays , you can use those for the days you are absent , so then you wo n't need any documents from the doctor . ``
Almost all Japanese employees do n't use their paid holidays . They just use it when they are sick .
I also did that when I was working and did n't think much about it until I went to the UK .
I heard from them how they use their paid holidays while I was living there .
They must use all of their paid holidays in a year , and if they are sick , they can take a sick day .
One colleague 's husband who is an IT consultant , said to me .
I was really surprised to hear from him at that time , because I knew that he was a very busy man in his work .
I was very envious of the people of the UK , but almost no Japanese people will ever know about the employment benefits of European workers .
But it is not a true view of our lives .
So he can use them when he is sick or injured and ca n't work .
People of the UK probably ca n't believe that .
I read an article that was really impressive .
I have been through a great deal of things during which he was an essential person who I could not live without .
But I 'm embarrassed to say that THANK YOU for raising me until now .
Of course I could not say this in front of him .
If you guys are able to understand this article in Japanese , I would recommend you guys check it out .
Today I made spaghetti .
Whenever I make spaghetti , I feel proud of myself .
I sometimes try to make different kind of spaghetti .
Today 's spaghetti was Vongole .
I will try to make other types of spaghetti next time .
This test 's score influences what college you enter , what job you get and whether or not you succeed at your career .
A lot of people study English a lot to try to get a high score on the test .
I want to know the value of a high score in a foreign country .
Would you give me some comments about it ?
Yesterday , I met in a shop with my last classmate Alice .
She has always been a unfriendly , gloomy and unscoiable girl .
She has no friends because her classmates did n't like her and did n't want to communicate with her .
Yesterday she greeted me with a smile .
I was shocked when I saw this changes in Alice .
She learned the rules of communication and now has a new friends .
Today is a beautiful day . I woke up at 9 o ` clock , and had more delicious food for breakfast .
In the afternoon , I surfed the internet .
It seems like a title of a composition in a Chinese primary school : p
I happened to see an episode of a TV entertainment programme last night .
To achieve this , she was determined to save lots of money to prepare for further study on dancing overseas .
That was tough for a single girl in China .
She had to earn money in the day time and review dance moves at night .
That was her definition of happiness .
I would like to say that , If language is a drug , then I am an addict ~
It seems that she does n't know how to communicate well with people .
Now , it is 11 : 44 at night .
In japan , there are many brilliantly lit houses around my house .
Almost all of those houses are using many LED lights .
This is because Christmas will come soon .
( I will probably buy a DVD recorder )
These fish are my pets .
My father takes care of them every day .
Until last summer we had to take care of two fishes of about five centimeters . ( two fish )
When we started to keep them , the size of them was about one centimeter . ( their size was )
However , they became bigger by feeding food .
At that time , I found that fish also becomes bigger like other animals . ( Good scientific observation )
They rarely do n't know what is their live for .
Sympathy is their outstanding personality .
About a month ago , I went to Chiba prefecture to see the Tokyo Game Show with my friends .
We went there by car .
The event started at 10 a . m . , so we had to leave our hometown at 4 a . m . I 'm not good at getting up early , but I managed ( this time around ) . * This sounds more natural
On our way to the show , we stopped by all the service areas , and ate many different kinds of local foods .
Then we arrived at the place where the show was being held a little behind schedule .
The show was really crowded and exciting .
We got the chance see tons of new video games , and took girly pictures in a photo booth .
I wish I could ( still ) play video games all day ( long ) .
Now I 'm addicted to Ulfuls which is one of Japan 's most famous band .
Although they 've already brokenup , their music is cheering people up .
They bring back how wonderful
love for another person is , even if I get depressed when hearing gloomy news on TV .
He is absolutely the greatest artist in the world .
If you hear him play a cover of `` Bring It Home To Me `` , you 'll feel the goose bumps of touched .
I 'm going to watch `` The Social Network `` today
Today , I 'm planning to go to a neighboring movie theater .
Later tonight I 'll have some beer with a friend from preschool .
After ten long years , we 'll finally meet again !
It 's been a long time since coming back here again .
I 've been studying until now , for about 3 months .
It was hard , but it 's over now .
Fortunately I did well on my test this past Saturday .
And I passed the first test for entering graduate school .
Next , there will be an interview on 5 September .
After the test , I rested .
But after today , I 'll earn some money , read books , train and prepare for my interview .
Good night .
Sometimes we talked about scary stories .
Because long time ago , there was no Halloween system in Japan .
Today is a hot day , I do not want to go outside , but I do not want to have an argument with my uncle either , so I finally agreed to hisrequirement .
We saw panda2 at the cinema . I watched it last week . It is never a happy experience when you watch a film twice .
when we got back home , I read some book ( I read a book named java2 , should I say pages ? )
Three hours left today , I need to study something before I waste it ^ - ^
It 's good to have friends ( who are ) from other countries because it 's fun to know each other .
Although many Japanese people simply have limited English proficiency , some highly educated individuals are capable of reading and writing articles in English , but still have trouble communicating verbally .
It frustrates me to see talented people who can not express their opinions due to limited English skills .
I want to help these people to become better communicators .
I want to take part in intensive and interactive communication training classes to improve their English fluency .
In my opinion , such training is missing in current education in Japan .
The TOEFL and TOEIC are commonly used to measure English proficiency .
As a result , some companies set minimum TOEIC scores for certain job titles . Thus , people who have n't studied English for years restart English learning for a limited time for better positions .
Entrance examinations for high schools , colleges , and graduate schools in Japan require English regardless of the chosen field .
The importance of English is apparent through these facts .
I believe this is an adverse aspect of score - centered curriculum in Japan .
Students learn vocabulary , how to analyze grammatical structures , and how to translate between English and Japanese . However , the ability to systematically coordinate these abilities and communication skills is currently insufficient .
I believe a more balanced approach that focuses on verbal communication would help improve English fluency among Japanese people .
Last night , I went to a home party hosted by my tango student .
There was a lot of delicious food ,
some drinks like champagne , wine and beer
& pleasant conversation & Dancing !
We danced Salsa & Tango .
at first , some people would not dance .
but , at last everyone did !
It was great !
Let 's dance anywhere ! !
I wish I could go somewhere and enjoy myself but there are n't any places to do that .
So , I think I will just watch some movies to kill time .
The Subway
Maybe this is a good opportunity to talk about the inappropriate behaviors I have observed on the subway .
Have you ever seen any ugly side of passengers on the subway ?
You know some things get on your nerve over and over again .
there are people who talk loudly on their cellphone on the subway .
Do n't get on my nerves please .
There are also people who watch shows on the cellphones without using earphones .
This irritates me .
Go get a motel room ! ! ! .
People who throw up because they drank too much alcohol .
Come on you guys ! ( Come on ! )
This is my first diary here ~ ~ !
Wow I had n't known about this brilliant site .
and get advice from you ! !
I do n't know who built this site but he might be a thoughtful person .
and please correct my English .
I have been studying Photoshop CS3 .
I know how to use other software such as the Microsoft office series and so on , Photoshop is really complicated ! !
I guess it will be fun once I have got the hang of it ( ^ ^ )
There are many English tutorials about Photoshop on the internet , and I am at them , so I am learning English and Photoshop at the same time .
I 'm excited now because today is Friday !
The long weekdays are finished .
A Good weekend is waiting for me ,
I 'm looking forward to going shopping tomorrow ,
and having a nice dinner .
I wish every day was the weekend !
I have been watching the American Drama `` Friends `` .
but the words used in it are too difficult for me to understand without Japanese subtitles .
Jokes may be hard for non - native speakers to understand sometime .
But still , the English used in Friends is easier than English used in other dramas .
My goal is to be able to draw manga .
However , I can not draw perfectly .
I use this site to practice painting :
By the way , there is a manga called Bakuman in which boys aspire to become manga artists .
I am reading it . That is why I wanted to draw manga .
The increase consisted of both a natural increase ( , ) and immigrants from other countries , in almost equal amounts .
North and West Europe composed the largest portion of immigrants to Australia with 34 % .
From these pie graphs , immigrants moving to Australia consisted of almost half of the new population in 2001 ( , ) although there was no significant growth in the total population .
`` immigrants from other countries `` is completely fine .
I met my friend in on - line messenger r 2 days ago .
Also , I asked him about what he was doing then .
Some days ago ,
I was relieved that `` I got released from working like a machine ``
But now , I feel a little bit tired .
It ca n't be helped .
It 's part of human nature .
And , I 'm thinking and writing in English now .
I 'm fighting my limited expression .
I know that I do n't have any sense of English .
In the message he said that he will sent me a second - hand DVD player .
He sent me a very good fruit cake .
They are shining or / They shine with a very lovely ivory color .
my son 's kisses bring me happiness
I am not so busy today .
I am just sitting and working in the normal way and in a normal mood .
But , of course it depends on the program made by the company .
For the project I could say that I will meet with hard days in the next week of this month .
And I know that it will go on for a long time .
Anyway , I want to write in my diary for now .
So , as usual I woke up and kissed my son on the cheek ) ) )
I like when he wakes up with me in the morning ) ) .
But the difference between me and his mother ( my wife ) is that she does not like it when he wakes up early ) ) ) .
Because she wants to sleep after seeing me off to work . ) ) .
When my son wakes up , he does not allow to her to sleep , because he wants to have milk , bread , tea . . . .
or other kinds of food ) ) )
During this time , she loses sleep and she can not sleep even though our son has got sleep .
Therefore , this is my favorite hobby , which I usually do ) ) .
Then I have a shower then we have breakfast together .
On the other hand it is so significant for him to wake up early and to have breakfast with me , because he likes to have breakfast with me , as otherwise he will not be in a good mood to get food . ) )
I could say that , when my son kisses me early it ( and the opposite ) means my business will go on in the normal way . . . .
I traveled to Hawaii before three years ago .
My favorite menu item is hotcakes .
I think that I want to eat it sometimes .
`` Eggs ' n Things `` have been established in Japan since 2010 .
I watched the `` King Kazu `` DVD today .
He 's one of the most famous soccer players in Japan .
He 's 43 years old now , but he still plays as a professional player .
It 's amazing , because most soccer players retire at around 35 or maybe 40 years of age .
In the show , he was asked `` Why do you keep playing ? `` to which he answered `` Soccer teaches me everything `` .
What an interesting book it is !
How beautiful those feathers are !
I will be glad to help you .
Half the year has passed .
I think that my English ability does not improve .
Friends in Australia , the United States , and Britain become my support at such times .
It looks like spring weather .
I sometimes make mistakes when I write English .
Our teacher is very strict but we all love him .
Still ( ? ) , I was able to enter the office .
After I come back to Beijing from Liaoning , I got a seriours flu , I have not studied English for about 13days , I feel nervous .
Tomorrow , I will recover my life pace , and spend more time in studying English .
I promise to get a high score in my GMAT exam , and toefl exam .
I believe in myself ~ !
Today was nothing special , just a normal day .
However , I did one thing I 've always wanted to - I finally submitted one of my paintings to the Liberty Times - one of the newspapers in Taiwan .
It 's actually not a long time after that thing , but it 's seemed to be a very long time for myself .
I think that I am now a mature , more confident person . I 've started to spend more time on myself , and do not think about other people 's things .
I do n't mean that I do n't want to care about other people 's thought but I mean that I have learned to respect myself more and more .
As for parents , It 's time to compare with them , because they are not healthy like before , you know what I want to say , everytime when I think of them I feel very sad , I ca n't change anything but compare with .
About love , Respect yourself , that 's the most important thing I learned , if you want to give , just do it , never expect anything back but respect yourself , rub her / him the right way is not the way you should do , be yourself .
I went to the beach with my friend Maki and Aly today .
we always gothere by car .
But we tried to go there by foot .
We walked for a long time .
While we were heading there ,
we thought that it was a crazy plan many times lol !
But when we finally arrived there , we were so happy ! !
We had a great time at the beach .
I 'm in big trouble on Lang - 8 !
I saw new corrections , comments and messages , because they popped up in the top of the first page on Lang - 8 before .
However , such highlight are gone !
They do n't show up on my page anymore ! !
That 's why I did n't notice some of the corrections , comments and messages these days .
I have to check each journal to see if I have new ones .
How about you ?
I 'm very happy that my first diary entry had been correctedby Lang - 8 friends so soon .
I find most of my mistakes are about capital letters with my carelessness .
I will be more caeful and hope that more friends will come here and help me and learn languages together . 3Q
Today , I dropped by LAWSON ( one of the famous convenience stores in Japan ) and bought a chocolate cake .
I like the ocean .
Especially , I love one of the islands in the south .
I went to Guam by myself last year .
This was my first time to go on a trip abroad alone , but it was a great experience .
So , I want to go to an island to see the beautiful ocean .
That would cheer me up !
About My Life in a Week
Today I will try to write about my life in English .
does anyone know UNY ? I usually sell
futons , sewing kits , kilts , and thread .
Every time I sell something I have to charge for it .
I work at UNY 4 ~ 5 days in a week .
Can I say `` Every time I have to be the cashier . `` ?
It means `` I have to work as a cashier too . ``
There 's no responsibility , but . . .

There was a / the / this massive earthquake in Japan , you know .
Fortunately , the damage in my district is not hard hit .
I worry about Japan 's economy , but I trust to make a strong comeback .
I am having a BBQ with my friend 's family today for celebreting the Mothers day .
But one of the friends was sick so we could n't do it .
We had very good time , it was very peacefull .
It 's so good to spend time like this .
Unfotunately I do n't have the time to do it .
I was surprised to hear that she had to see a dentist more than ten times a year
I need to see him as soon as possible
`` The person who lives in the moment is a happy person .
He can concentrate on every single moment , without regretting the past nor worrying about the future .
Today I learned about how to be good at English on www . edufire . com
while I have been studying , I listen to the detaisl on youtube . So I am confused as to what she talked about .
I am not good at English
Please help me summarize .
I had to translate to Thai the word `` craigslist `` but I ca n't find its meaning . .
but I imagined she talked about how to make another people know about my lessons .
Am I right or not ?
How do I pronounce it ?
I wondered why the more game they played , the better they made their own game .
There are many tests at the end of this month .
I will have to study hard .
Suppose you saw your friend Tom leave your office for home about an hour ago , and you know that it takes him about an hour to commute .
I talked to one of my friends about our future plans .
We plan to go to Vietnam to get jobs that are related to the field of trading products in Kor .
We have to make lots of friends when we 've done those things because we could get more information on Vietnamese culture .
He is really sure that we can make the most of it .
But there is one thing we should be careful to do and that is to take care of each other .
Of course I 'll . . .
that is what I am .
My will is too weak to keep the promise ( or : agreement ) .
I LIKE hanging around people who like them ~ ! !
What on earth ?
Is it the weather 's fault ?
Is it due to lack of nourishment ?
The stomatitis issue gives me bloody hard times . . which really kills me ( ToT )
I already take a pill of vitamin B everyday . . but it does n't work .
I washed my mouth with mouth cleaner . . and it did n't work , either .
Two weeks passed , and it got bigger than ever . . non - stop .
Because chatting with my friends is always pleasant , it gives me a different pleasure .
Also if you chat on line with your friends , you can send them pictures , songs and so on , no matter how far awayyou arefrom them .
This picture is of my grandmother
I 'm grateful to my family for growing vegetables and rice .
Thanks to them , I can eat delicious Japanese food .
Kailan ka ba pupunta doon ?
I have been busy the past two weeks .
It was good !
I hope she is happy .
I go to the market every week
I take my kids when I go to the market .
The big market ( supermarket ) has a toy shop ( inside ) .
My kids do n't ( ca n't ) pass by the toy shop .
I understand my kids ' feelings .
It is not a good experience ( for them ) .
I have not writen a journal entry in a while .
coz I had a presentation about my thesis due on feb 17th .
and I did it successfully .
next , I have until March 9th to write and hand in the thesis .
so this busy lifecycle will have to continue for a while > _ <
I apologise that I wo n't be able to send you this translation that I promised you .
Yesterday I caught a cold and I have a terrible headache .
I 'll make this translation when I 'm better .
Today , I was invited by the News Center School of Science which is a part of the Student Union to give a lecture about photography .
I was glad to do this .
Not because I was invited , but because this means I am known as a photographer , which gives me a sense of accomplishment .
It does n't take me that long to prepare the lecture
since this is something that I am familiar with .
However , many people do n't judge me by my photography skills , nor even see my photos .
To be a real photographer I need to do plenty of practice
and develop a sharp insight .
The Golden week ( It is a Japanese holiday . ) passed .
But we had thought it would have more nature .
The road was made .
But we wanted to walk on nature 's road .
This is a very famaus place .
We both got an excellent paper !
She seemed to like it .
And we were also happy because we do n't have to take the time to entertain her .
It was a very tiring day for me today .
As I said in my previous diary entry , I work for a factory .
That means , I wear a work uniform and helmet
People associate suits and neckties with business people .
I commute in casual wear and change clothes in a locker room of the factory every day .
It 's easy work .
I had already finished reading some of her other & nbsp ; works , for example , `` Confessions of a Shopaholic `` .
I read up to about 20 pages today .
If I read 20 pages every & nbsp ; day , it will take 20 days to finish reading it .
Because of the Pulmonary Pathology Training Session that was being held there .
A Total of 200 people participated in the session .
Pathologists including me were about 10 , Radiologists were also about 10 , and all the others were Respiratory physicians .
On Saturday , the session started at 9 : 00 , and it finished 18 : 00 .
That long time session wearied me , but I was stimulated with the contents .
On the way back I read an English grammar text book on the airplane .
I 'm a student in the school of arts at Chulalongkorn University .
During summer break , most of my colleagues will travel abroad to take foreign English courses .
I 'm not rich enough to pay for the trip , and I 'm not smart enough to win the scholarship so that I could go abroad for free .
I feel a little childish , but I think I 'm a suffering from peer pressure .
I do n't know why , but my English seems to get worse and worse even though I 'm majoring in English .
In my literature class , I have to read a lot of novels and study a lot of difficult vocabulary such as `` demythologize `` ( is there anyone who uses this word in real life ?
- - ' ' ) , `` patriarchy `` , and more .
Sometimes I feel like I 'm not even studying a human language .
I think my English has gotten worse because I did n't practice enough , so I started to read and write more in English .
As a result , I have become a member in this site hoping to develop my skills .
Thank you in advance for any corrections you can find !
I 'm sleepy this morning .
I 'll wake up by drinking black coffee .
Do you drink coffee when you 're sleepy ?
What is important in our lives ? What do we like most of all : family , friends , the world , our computers ? Our world is violent and we must like something in order to live in it .
Some people think that their family is the most important thing in their life , and that they helps them with different problems and always understand them .
The same situation applies to friends .
They are always ready to help you and you can always rely on them .
There are a lot of things that we like , but are there things which can love or help you ? I doubt it .
Only people close to us are worthy of our love and attention .
Each person chooses important things only for themselves : family , friends , their computer or other things .
New Years Greeting Card !
I received 15 new years greeting card from my friends this year .
Some friends gave me greeting cards by e - mail .
I was very happy to see photos of my friends and their children .
I that I had caught a cold this morning , so I was in a bad mood when I had our hand - painting class .
I 'm ok apart from my cold , but I hope tomorrow morning it dose n't rain , I will phone my grandma because it 's her birthday , I love her , I hope she and grandpa will stay happy and healthy ~ ~ ~ ~
I 'm a web developer from Russia ( Django , MySQL , jQuery ) .
I 'm interested in this project , so I want to submit ( this entry ) for you .
I think ( I will ) enjoy the party !
Everything will be an experience
My Recent works are good experiences that I did for the first time .
For example , exchanging e - mails with foreign people and making a plans to promote our products to a lot of partners .
But I really wanted to do something irritating to them .
So , I shouted at them loudly `` Fuck off men , come on , here I am , come get me if you dare ! HAHA ! `` There was around 30m between me and them .
come on son of a bitch , I am going to fuck your younger sister , oh sorry nobody wants to fuck such an ugly monkey HAHA !
you should ask other male monkeys . `` One of them got out of the car , and said something back to me , but I did n't mind at all .
As I told you , there was about 30m between me and them , even though they had rushed towards me on feet , I could have easily escaped .
I found some stones on the road , I picked them up and threw them toward the black car .
I was so excited , the adrenaline rushing to my head .
Another gangster got out of the car , and said to me `` I am going to kill you ! ! `` I laughed at them loudly .
That night , I could n't sleep at all , because I was so excited .
My name is Tomo , the man who escaped from the gangsters ( chasing ) lol
I 've already been the Boston about six months .
We are students so we do n't have enough money to take a ( an ) airplane .
At that time , I could n't sleep on the bus even though I felt tiredness ( tired ) .
Not sleeping on the transf ( p ) ortation is a kind of my bizarre habit .
I hope I am not tired and do n't become ( a ) very sensitive person so I do n't get my friends annoy ( annoyed ) .
He is like a wall ! ' Small kimusan ' belongs to my class and ' the biggest kimusan ' belongs to class 11 ( I do n't know about the second tallest one very well ) .
Today , ( now yesterday ) I tried to chat with others for the first time .

He looked like he cared about the words on it .
Her facial expression is so impressive .

I do n't know how to write in english .
But I decided that other people also study for theirselves .
I commented on another person 's diary .
So I have to write in my diary day by day .
It is a very big present for me
no matter how I finish this research
nowadays I need to be motivated to study .
This was not my first time to skipping classes .
Why do n't I have any motivation ? ?
However , nowadays the job hunting time is approaching and I am thinking about that .
Also , taking a business class in UCSD makes me think about my future .
With respect to business , studying is not enough ,
I need experience and failure as well .
At the same time , I really like life and friends in San Diego .
SO nowadays it is so complicated .
I do n't want to waste time , so I am thinking about that .
I want to study computer and C language , and try to make iphone applications !
I want to experience presentations or public speaking because I hate that .
I am a Japanese student
I would like to improve my English and make friends with people who like road - biking , sports and manga .
Pleased to meet you
I have made my book .
I have chatted with my friends .
I am happy to know something .
I am going to do it .
I have n't done it before .
What am I gon na do ?
I ca n't explain .
my question is , how I can use this expression , `` sort out ``
Can you explain to me ?
Then what about this word `` guys `` ? how is it different from the word , `` guy ``
Going back home
Today I also had a job interview , and I was able to talk well .
In addition , I got a lot of useful information from the interviewer .
My hometown still has heavy snow .
I hope I can get back home safely .
I always write the date in the title of my diary on this web site .
Please , someone teach me .
Today is the 15th .
Tomorrow is the 16th .
If it passed a year , it is 380th .
Will it continue on as `` th `` ?
And I was in the second one just when I thought that I would be leaving home with my oldest daughter for her piano lesson .
As for the third one ,
I was at the dentist at that time .
What if the dentist is working on my bad tooth then ?
My first Lang - 8 entry
I hope many people will help me take my English one step further !
Finally , as I enjoy drawing , I 've attached one of my works in colored pencil .
It was a great time for rest .

I want to talk to people all over the world . .
Please tell me if I make a mistake . .
We held the class reunion in an all - you - can - eat restaurant where food is provided by the Sukiyaki and hot pot .
The waitresses had to be so strict to control the time that a person took eating a meal
We still kept chatting and laughing the whole time .
The subjects were various , such as about experiences from jobs to the funny things .
It seemed that we went back in time like we were all still students in school .
We are currently planning to have a trip together in April .
Hope this trip can be fulfilled as most of our time is occupied by the work .
My nephew is coming home .
He is so cute .
I am playing a video game with him .
But he might be very sleepy .
I tried to write something in English .
I hope my English gets better . .
Poor kitties
Two kittens were born about 3 weeks ago .
One day , my father told me that a cat gave birth to two kittens .
They do not belong to anybody , and they are also homeless .
Yesterday morning my mother told me that the mother cat felt very sorry because she had lost her babies .
What 's wrong with her babies ?
She is so sad , and we feel very sorry for her as well .
And today I heard the latest news that the two kittens have gotten lost ! Maybe forever ! + Gevalt ! Dc8 +
`` Miaow ~ ~ ~ ~ `` . . . Oh , you poor tiny defenceless little things ! Where are you ?
Your mother is searching for U !
Please come home soon !
The library sent an email to inform me that a book I had reserved through the library 's HP was available .
I stopped by at the library to fetch it on my way home this evening .
It was the book I had borrowed once but failed to finish reading because the due date was up .
I wanted to read it again so I reserved it two months ago .
At last I got it .
However my eagerness has faded .
I like rainy days , the rain makes me feel comfortable in my heart .
The rain in May , like a faraway friend , brings me a lovely gift .
But on rainy days , I often think of many things and people in the past . It always makes me feel lonely and sad .
Familiar music or a sad movie will wake up my memories , bygones often make me cry , with the rain outside .
I often tell myself : Let bygones be bygones .
Today is a gift to me , I should treasure the happiness by my side now .
I got a present from my parents .
There were many things in the box ; fruit like a melon and sweets , chocolates ,
the vest and hat made by my mother .
I felt happy .
Damn , I almost forgot to write in my diary .
Umm , I almost forgot what happend today . > < I was very busy and tired .
This morning I went to Guangzhou to visit my mum .
By the way , I tried to phone of some friends to tell them I am back .
But damn , they are not in town . > <
She got the Academy Award through this role .
The movie was very interesting and it was for mature people because it contained some scenes which are not good for children .
I have a limited vocabulary
I find it challenging to read English texts .
For what reason ?
Today I just watched the latest episode of ' Gossip Girl . ' What pleases me is that I think the story is going back to normal . I mean , the last couple of episodes have been kind of ridiculous .
Every time I watch the series I always feel unbelievable .
For example , every one on this show is outlandishly rich and lead such luxurious lives that I ca n't imagine .
And in fact , I would never have the lives like theirs .
However , I heard a sentence that impressed me during the last episode .
Nate , one of the characters in ' Gossip girl , ' said , `` Growing up , I never knew what I was supposed to be . . . ``
His words touched me .
I always try to find my way in the future or expect myself to do something , but in the end it seems that I find nothing . GOOD !
Maybe not thinking too much is the best way to have good days .
I just ate and then came to check lang - 8 .
On new year I am going to Uthaitani City , which is my hometown .
However I would rather celabate new year in Bangkok .
This moive is really famous in Thai .
The man who running on the elephant is really good at ( kick ? ) boxing and did not use a stunt man . . .
He is a really good action star . . . . . ^ ^
Thank you for coming to my space .
Twenty two year old innocent guy .
I am studying for TOEFL to improve my English , so I am glad if you correct my random writing !
Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow are holidays .
I am very happy .
Hi .
My name is Nobuhiro .
I want to speak English , so I 'm studying English .
But , I have n't used English for about 10 years . . .
one day , I was talking on the phone with my friend .
someone with you know ?
also I did n't play any music or TV .
he said `` Are there children ?
but of course nobody was there .
I said `` is n't it from your side ?
but he also said `` No no from your side .
It 's louder !
also he said `` getting louder still , and some is crying ! ``
I was very surprised and tried to call him many times .
but I could not reach him at the day .
The next day , I went to his house .
he looked very tired but he told me what happened the night before .
but suddenly , he heard the voices close to his ear .
at the same time , the Light in his room went out .
and his room resonated with the loud laughter of children .
at next moment , he had fainted .
Learning English is not that easy
I first fell in love in learning English when my first overseas trip to England 15 years ago .
( Even now it is still suck but a bit better I think )
In England , I visited many places such as London Bridge , Madam Tussauds , and many many more
This week , I saw `` Water `` made by a Canadian and Indian staff .
It is about the lives of widows in India , who are discriminated because of the Hindi bible .
The setting takes place in an orphanage for widows in India in the 1940 's ( probably ; Gandhi is on the movie ) .
In my view , it is so sad , but I ca n't say it is evil 'cause it is a cultural and religious fact .
I have respect for any religion as an atheist .
I hope the discrimination is beginning to fade away though .
First of all , many young people like to travel to other countries when they finish their studies from high school to learn about a new culture .
For example when you travel to Egypt you will learn arabic culture and you will know what they are doing in their free time .
Also you will learn some popular arabic words , and you will know what kind of food they eat .
When you come back to your country maybe you should work for a few years to prepare for studying at university .
In my opinion , travel or work for a year will give the students a lot of experiences that will make them successful in the future .
It rained heavily today for the whole day .
Fortunately , it was not pouring
out there when I went to school .
, however , today was different from the other days .
professors from our sister university , so it was really busy until my
The bad news is we that will hold another big conference which could be just
and she gets nervous easily , even when there is nothing to
I always think that she is a psycho , hahaha .
After writing here , I suddenly noticed that the title has nothing much to do
Today , I went to plastic surgery center and hair salon .
The salon was very beautiful but it is more expensive than that in Tsukuba City and
I want to change the shop somewhere else next time .
After going to the salon , I went to the plastic surgery center .
The doctor said that I have mild degree of hernia on the neck .
I have to go to the hospital twice a week .
After dinner , I played table tennis with Kuga .
I want to study english from now on ! !
I Have Been Recently Preparing for TOEIC and OPIc
Do you know about TOEIC and OPIc ?
These are English proficiency tests .
TOEIC requires listening and reading skills , and the other demands oral proficiency .
In Korea , if you want to get a job at one of the best companies , then you would need to get a high score on the tests .
Given that I have become a senior in university , I have to improve my score .
Maybe I could increase my TOEIC score relatively easily unlike the OPIc .
Speaking in English is very hard to for me .
How could I improve the frequency of my speech in English ?
That 's it , I 'm half a century old !
I celebrated ( my birthday ) with my family .
50 years between memories and the future !
This week , we 'll return to lighter meals .
Now , Japanese wisteria is in a full bloom at a nearby park .
The flower smells sweet around here .
I love the color of the japanese wisteria .
It is from light purple gradually to deep purple .
Maybe we were being pulled toward each other . : D
It 's just a simple question .
The item which is used for erasing pencil writing is called ' eraser ' in America , and ' rubber ' in England , right ?
Then how do you say the one which uses for erase chalk ?
I think ' eraser ' is OK , but ' rubber ' sounds weird , because it 's not made of rubber ?
Today , I worked hard and got very exhausted .
So I left to go to the gym to work out !
There was a soccer match between Japan and South Korea yesterday .
I did not expect such a bad result from our Japanese representatives either .
Every night , as soon as I go to bed , he comes and presses his nose against my face .
This means `` Let me get under your comforter `` .
So I pull up my comforter , and he slips into a space under my arm .
He neatly hunches ( curls ) himself and put his chin onto my arm , and then , sighs with satisfaction .
This sound file was made by me and my American friend who is learning Japanese .
I met her at another community ( not Lang - 8 ) .
We , for the first time , actually talked to each other .
Yesterday my friend from school told me about her summer lover ( hehe ) .
He is professor of Italian in the USA and he said he 's so addicted to Russian literature ( . .
and maybe to Russian girls ? . . ) , especially Dostoevsky .
`` The whole world loves him ! `` I said and indeed it is true .
You know who was born on the same date , do n't you ?
But everyone uses the date of November 3rd .
I never could have a party .
This is not a birthday day , this is a birthday week . )
Among my friends we have a tradition to not give the presents on the proper day .
- I 'll give it to you later , when you wo n't expect it .
So , I 'm already so used to this that when they presented me something it was more unexpected .
Even my brother , who never remembers the date of my birthday ( but you can see it 's not a problem ) ) , told me that everything that I paint sucks and presented me with a picture . )
Now I 'm thinking all my presents are so amusing , so fancy , is it because they really are , or because I did n't expect it ? )
I did mathematics and Japanese . It was fun that I did homework .
In Summer vacation , I went to the country to teach students .
People say that is supporting education .
I think that is meaningfully .
when I was a child , I had a dream to help others .
Before my departure , I had to do many things until 24 : 00 .
Even though I was tired , I was happy .
When I was standing at the podium , I was very nervous .
But the students were very friendly , they helped me complete my first show .
After a long time , I 'm writing a diary again .
I 'm doing Millitary Service in the Korea Air Force .
So I had Volunteered . .
My millitary service remains about 150days .
I 'd like to hang out other in another area and find some good stuff next time : )
A woman recently wrote a heartbreaking confession in the counseling section of a magazine that I read .
She was raped shortly after being wed .
The rapist was her sister - in - law 's husband .
Her husband was being treated at a hospital and her sister - in - law was at the hospital to visit him at that time .
The woman told her sister - in - law about the incident .
Her husband and her sister in law prefer to save themselves from embarrassment .
Her sister in law adopted the woman 's son as an act to redeem her husband 's bad deed .
Up until now , her son knew her as his aunt .
Any sane mother would love to be recognized by her own flesh and blood but telling the truth might make the son hate the origin of his existence .
Not because of his pure love of God .
Today I read an article about different ways to be happy .
One of them is to write five items about something that you liked , everyday
I did n't go to school today
I was at art school , we painted with water colours at last
I ate a yummy bar of chocolate
I heard / told a funny joke .
write your five items in the comments , if it is n't difficult for you = )
Why are cats so cute ! ?
Oh , I did nothing today because of YouTube and cats . . .
I always wish thatI were ( stronger ) .
But I know that thinking about that is nonsense , so I trying to not think .
There 's no change with me , and I amsame asbefore .
( Speaking is still not good ) I still ca n't speak very well andca n't describe what I think to my friends .
I want to speak and have a morepleasant conversation ( pleasantlymore ) with my friend .
I have to think in more simple terms ( things simply ) .
hopefully , I will get better ( and talking ) at speakingwell more than I donow .
I went to the market and bought some ingredients :
I like Friday nights .

I love relax time on Friday night .
My job is snowboard wear and wakeboard wear marketing .
I 'm going to las vegas on jan . 24
Dinner Cruise
I have not written in my diary because I have been very busy with my work .
Now I am able to write in my diary again .
It 's my day off today .
So I took a dinner cruise on Tokyo Bay .
It was fantastic .
I have never been on passenger boat like that luxury liner .
I ate French cuisine and drank wine .
I went out on the deck from the dining room after my meal .
The view from the deck was very beautiful .
After I got off the boat , I went to Chidorigafuchi and the Yasukuni - Shrine
to see cherry blossoms .
Japanese people call it `` Ohanami . ``
Chidorigafuchi and the Yaskuni - Shrine are located around the Imperial Palace .
It was best time for Ohanami .
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom right now .
Do you know about Ohanami ?
And do you participate in Ohanami ?
Using the subway in Seoul ! : D
Most people use their own transportation card and it is really convenient in many aspects .
You do n't need to waste time to buy a card and you can get a transfer discount .
Also if you buy a foreigner one , named Seoul Citypass + , you can visit some famous tourist attractions and restaurants with the discount price .
There are many interesting places and events in the Seoul subway .
In the station , there is a small gallery , Gwang Hwa lang , which you can see for free .
It is small , but you can appreciate the pictures and paintings .
Omisoka is a Japanese word that means `` the last day of a year . ``
I do n't know why we do these things , but they are our traditions and I can feel the end of the year when we do them .
Are you counting down with your family , friends or lover ?
It was really sweet to reunite my parents in Europe .
To cleanse your skin means not only just to wash your face but including to take your make up off ?
Yesterday I went shopping to get my facial stuff and a clerk asked me how I cleanse my skin , but I did n't understand she meant to say only to wash my face or to wash make - up off ?
And if you suggest suitable words for me to know , tell me some please .
I 've started taking business English class since the beginning of May .
I can learn not only English communication but also business skills like how to be a good facilitator and how to negotiate effectively .
Last friday night , I came home , and when I fished dinner I watched a movie named FRIENDS . It is a good movie . Those people are very funny .
On saturday I went to the gym with Jimmy . We played Basketball together . We enjoyed it very much .
On Sunday , I went to my cousin 's school , he is major in school , and he cooked some food for me when I want to go home .
This morning I ate the sandwich that my cousin made for me . It 's delicious .
I 've made some fashion accessories
Especially , making earrings .
It 's lighthearted , is finished quickly , and I 'm in high spirits wearing jewelry and going out .
Last Sunday , my son has been able to ride a bike by himself .
But I answered that we go there with the bike together for a while .
Is ' The Exciting Saturday ' correct translation ? `` An Exciting Saturday ``
This was my son 's elementary school event .
At the entrance booth * , he showed a stamp map which was given at school and I asked the receptionist for one more stamp map for my daughter .
There were many games , such as , Hula - Hoop Throwing Game ( a competition on how long they throw ) , Catching Paper With Chopsticks , Scooping Water Walloon , Dropping 1 Yen Coin to the bins in an aquarium tank , Pitching Game , and so on .
Also there were shops selling juice and cheap sweets
these cheap sweets are called `` dagashi `` .
And there was a booth giving snow cup with syrups as a present to those who played three games .
There was a tea ceremony booth .
That s opened from 9 : 00 to 13 : 00 .
We almost ended the game at 12 : 00 , so we returned home .
We went there with the bike and that was my son 's first time to ride his bike to going somewhere .
I was annoyed with his accidents but he can ride safely .
When we returned home , we met a foreign teacher and a pupil girl from an English School .
I thought that they would go to the event .
this is the community 's event .
So , if the school is a member of this neighborhood community ,
they should go there .
At 16 : 10 , my son will go to his swimming school .
I 'll leave my daughter at my parent 's home and go the elementary school .
I think I would be able to come home after 30 minutes , so I told him that if tif no one was home , please wait at the entrance of the apartment building . . . . .
Will I be in time before he comes home ?
I 'd better move on !
I read about them in magazines but never listened to their songs very seriously .
However , that was such an amazing show that it stirred my interest in the band !
Many japanese companies adopted a test for job hunting .
The name of the test is SPI2 .
One half of it is math , the other half Japanese .
why , why do many companies want to test Linear functions and Factorization ?
Imagine you want to buy a melon for 500 yen ( fixed price ) . You have 100 yen coins , 50 yen coins and 10 yen coins .
How many ways of paying the melon do exist ?
You can use only two kinds of coins .
SPI2 makes me crazy . . .
Lately , I ` ve been listening to the radio while studying .
It 's ' Lazy song ' by Bruno Mars .
The PV of it is very interesting .
He sings and dances with the monkeys .
It 's my cats crying ( yeah , it 's really crying and today is not an exception ) for begging me to feed them .
But one of the cats named `` Wow `` has a much louder voice than the other cats .
He has really `` wow `` voice especially when he used to ask for something to eat .
But mostly , they are very quiet and spend their time sleeping .
Sometimes I wish I were a cat and sleep all day and they were human to feed me .
What is three - people learning ?
If you learn only by hearing , you will easily forget , but if you additionally tell someone what you have learned , it will be hard to forget .
To teach someone is not only about someone else 's learning , but it also makes it hard to forget what you learned .
How to learn the fundamentals of other languages
The first step in studying language
I struggled to find the way to learn other languages efficiently . ( or effectively ) .
I did n't have enough money to go to a language school ,
so I have to study by myself .
After 5 years of looking , I found one of the ways to understand the foundation of other languages .
I think we have to fill our brain with the fundamental sentences of the new language .
When we have to use the language ,
the sentences will appear automatically .
To fill up your brain with the sentences ,
It 's good to hear , to speak , to read and to write the sentence any number of times .
For practicing this way there is a text published by Maruzen , [ TOIEC traning ] series .
This text explains the way of fundamental training .
Of course the method can be applied to other texts containing fundamental sentenses with CD
When you try this method at first ,
I recommend you use this text .
It 's efficient for learning the correct way .
Now I will apply this method for learning Chinese .
I 'm looking forward to the day that I can explain the effectiveness of this method for gaining ability in foreign languages .
A chat on the phone
I got a call from an old friend .
I 'm still married .
I know I 'm a work - a - holic , right now .
and I forget how to enjoy my life . . . . .
I had a nightmare last night .
It was about me being in the army .
However , it was not planned and there was evidence .
As soon as police started a search , I was arrested by them .
While I had a troubled mind , I pretended to not be a criminal .
And then I woke up .
This morning a truck hit a pedestrian on the street .
Going to a Church for the First Time
In China , Christian beliefs are not widespread .
Spending a foreign festival like Christmas in a `` foreign `` place seems very interesting .
Today , I 'd like to write about a way of thinking .
There are a lot of thinking styles and they are published in some business books .
I am faced with a lot of ways .
Of couse the best way is different , but I actually think it is worth thinking about the concept of designing .
Looking for the essential elements is a good concept for doing something creative , I think .
I 've mowed all of the field where my mother grows vegetables .
My mother was satisfied with the cleared field .
Because my wife does n't like pears very much , I do n't get the chance to eat them often even though I like them .
Because of a traffic jam on the highway , while we were on the winding and rugged road , the sun almost went down .
At that moment , I could n't help but imagine whether something would rush up and show itself suddenly .
You know what I 'm talking about : `` The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . `` ! !
I 'm the kind of person who grew up in a big city , so I have less chance to have contact with nature .
During the 2 - day trip , I picked up wood , rode an ATV ( all - terrain vehicle ) on a wooded path , and observed deer and hogs .
And that means the exams are right around the corner .
Oh no ! Again !
It seems that the Chinese students are more anxious before exams , compared to the students of other nations .
Perhaps it is due to our education system - you come to school to study , the school gives you a mark on your paper .
That 's all .
Maybe this opinion is too radical , we should try to see things in different lights .
We see the world through our colored glasses .
Impartiality is what everyone pursues , but no one really succeeds .
Well , no more talking .
The exams are my priority now .
Study , and get a good mark !
I take two English classes at University .
The other is intended for Japanese students .
Most students are active in the class .
I think the teacher tries to teach enthusiastically , and he is good teacher .
I have already memorized the textbook before entering university .
But the situation has changed since entering university .
We have to think deeply and I have to act based on my will .
So , I try to argue with many people as well as memorize the knowledge .
Maybe in other countries it is standard that students have a chance to discuss , but
The government needs to change the education system . . .
Library , you are the most precious place I have ever gone .
If you will ask me what is the best place I have ever gone ,
my answer would be the library .
When I was still a freshman in a university , I had this feeling of being so free
like a bird that had fled from the cage .
The only thing that I had in my mind was I will only do the things that I like to do .
But now I know that it is a dangerous idea .
Thinking that no one can stop me from what I want to do sounds like a good idea .
But in reality , it may be harmful for me .
Why is it harmful for me ? It is because I am addicted to computer games .
I had been playing computer games for about half a year
until one day , when I entered a library ,
the very first thing that I saw there was the shelves of books .
I like English , so I picked up an English novel titled `` Pride and Prejudice `` , a famous novel written by Jane Austen .
I like the novel so much that I read it several times .
Then I found myself in love with reading a novel . From that time , I read lots of novel by different authors . .
That is the reason why library is the most precious place I haver gone in my college life .
The reason why I joined this site is to improve my English skill to study abroad in near future .
So , I 'll appreciate all your messages .

A love about two men
A love deeper than a man and a woman
I think sometimes maybe I can watch Brokeback Mountain
I still like the love when it 's about man and woman
I think Skype is very useful for learning a foreign language .
However , speaking and listening are more difficult to learn because you have little opportunity to talk with a person who speaks your learning language .
The truth is / actually , I 'm very shy ! ! !
I wish I had the courage ! ! !
Today , I will introduce one of my favorite singers , Angela Aki .
Recently , she 's gotten famous in Japan .
( * _ * ) So I ran to music store to buy her CD the next day .
It was a nice CD .
Her concert was also nice !
Her talk was amusing .
The X ' mas concert will be held in Budoukan , which is one of the biggest halls in December .
If you want to know more about her , please check Wikipedia or her website .
It 'll help you , but I do n't know if it is correct information . ( ^ _ ^ ; )
This is `` HOME `` . The first song I heard by her .
Today , in the news today two big companies are merging in Japan .
Kirin which is a common company , which part of the Mitsubishi - affiliated companies .
Santory is a family own company in Osaka .
I like Kirin remon , and Santory 's beer .
In china , peaple drink Santory 's beer more than chinese beer .
We are surprised by the news !
Canada Dollar shaped chocolate !
I was given these chocolate and Canadian coins by my Canadian friend who came back from Canada .

The other day , an earthquake happened in the United States .
I feared the worst when I heard about it .
Because , when it happened I was reminded of 3 . 11 .
But , there were no deaths in this earthquake .
In Japan , there was a little small earthquake two days before 3 . 11 .
I hope that the earthquake in America was not a foreshock .
[ 5 ] Why do you read such a strange book that has pictures of a lot of animal ls ' hips in it ?
But without sufficient computer skills you will get confused by your mac sometimes , here are some tips & tricks I have found from my daily use .
I finished preparing dinner and now I am drinking green tea .
This afternoon , I will participate in a study session .
During the study session , I take my children to a nursery next door .
I still can not decide whether to participate in today 's study session .
For nearly a week , the children have cried all night , and we are tired .
Here I have an English native friend !
So each of us needs each others ' help .
However , it is a little difficult to meet with a native speaker .
Fortunately , I have gotten help from two of them .
Because I have hay fever .
I miss the little girl that lived inside of me
Growing up is a painful and lucky thing .
At that time Ihad done and said lots of foolish things .
At that timeI wasjust a cowardly girl whogot / received unfair treatment from others andcould n't stand up for herself .
At that timeI wasjust an ugly duckling whose my classmates thought was ugly and treated as nothing .
But at that time I was kind I never gossiped about others .
At that time Iwas thankfulto anyone whowas being kind to me .
At that time I loved looking at sky just because it was pure blue .
Now , I 'm not that little girl anymore .
I think twice before I speak . I can hurt others back if they ever hurt me .
I have people who back me up , because they like me .
I dont have time to look at the sky anymore , since I am busy giving others who I need a babylike smile to make them like me and reading lots and lots fashion mag .
Looking at the photo I took when Iwas a kid , the pathetic little girl ( I see ) is sooooo ugly .
If you met a ugly short shy little girl please be nice to her , dont hurt her or do anything to let her change , let her be an angel for a little while more .
Can you describe a colleague that you work with ?
He is always smiling .

The next day , a reunion party will be held and I will meet my old classmates at my elementary school .
I worked in the shop as a volunteer in the morning and I went to yoga class in the evening .
The Super Moon is a moon which is nearest to the earth and it is full moon at the same time .
It is kind of an oval .
And according to some news , it is the first time in 19 years !
I should reflect on myself who did none of the things which I had decided to do .
I can practice my English and Japanese a lot and meet foreign people here !
When we go for a ride , we speak in English .
On hot days , of course we drink cold beer and on cold days in winter we also love cold beer with hot dishes .
On the contrary the upper class people in England love to drink beer at room temperature .
If it is true , please tell me the reason .
Does it depend on the climate ?
When my hostfather drank beer with ice , I thought it was very strange .
Because it was the first time I 'd seen this .
Is this normal for people in the U .
I like Kyoto .
I majored in mechanical technology , specifically heat transfer .
I develop new products of air conditioners making use of the technologies I have learnt these days .
Therefore , I go to Kyoto several times a year with my family .
I like the garden of Ginkakuji - temple ( Silver temple ) .
I like Tetsugaku - no - michi ( Philosophers ' trail ) , too .
It has been over a week since the earthquake and Tsunami hit Japan .
I believe that my office building is earthquake - proof , but now the building is n't as strong as before .
But anyway , my English teacher taught me a very nice phrase : `` Every cloud has a silver lining ``
Moreover we will need to improve our lives and get make them better than before the earthquake !
Finally I have started Lang - 8 .
My English skills are n't perfect yet ,
but I will learn English perfectly .
Because someone will teach me English .
Japanese is my mother tongue and I can speak German fluently and English limited .
I studied Swedish and Chinese in college in Germany for one year because of those interesting intonations .
I graduated in the spring of 2010 and started working in the autumn of the same year .
I wanna improve my English skills , but I 'm too lazy to study English . . .
So at least I try watching DVDs in English , to write diary every day and to read papers about language acquisition , phonetics etc in English .
Until recently , I thought that most people are rude and angry , so , to be honest , I didn ` t like them .
Every sunday I go to the choir practice at 11 o ` clock .
That day my father brought me there .
After 10 minutes , I found out that my teacher and friends - singers / the other singers were not there . . .
Therefor / So I decided to go home .
Then I found out that I had no money to pay the bus !
And my street was so far away !
But unexpectedly I got an idea !
I could call my father and ask him to take me home !
I noticed a lad standing near the cafe who was listening to music .
I asked him what I wanted and he smiled , giving me his `` nokia `` .
I smiled in response back and dialed my father 's number .
But my father / dad was too far away , so he couldn ` t help me !
I saw 10 rubles laying in my hand .
I hung up and looked at the man / lad .
I really didn ` t know what to say , except for a loud and sincere `` Thank you very much ! `` .
It 's not a very great deal , but I think that nowadays kindness is the heroic deed !

She has lived in Japan for more than 20 years .
She has a Malaysian friend who had a japanese husband .
This is the story about his funeral .
The method of the Muslim funeral is the burial .
But in the case of Japanese Buddhism , it cremates a corpse and puts a bone in a pot by using chopsticks .
The cremation is decided by a law in Japan , and the burial is permitted only in some areas .
My teacher and her friend participated in his cremention unwillingly
His wife fainted many times and cried , and then the teacher was scared of the human boneand really hated catching the bone with chopsticks !
I have n't thought that the bone was scary .
And besides , I have seen this happen many times now .
After all , is everybody scared of the human bone ?
Hoping to move into cloud - based money management
Some , such as Wesabe and Shryk , have already closed .
Here are my requests for the money management service :
# 1 free or a little bit of recurring cost , less than US $ 5 per month
I can not use multi - byte characters in account aliases and merchant entries .
OFX files provided by Japanese banks include multi - byte characters , so I can not import my OFX files correctly .
I sent email to the support team a little while ago .
I think that Most Japanese banks are outdated , because they do n't provide tools that support reporting and tracking cash flow , analyzing financial statements , and achieving our financial goals .
I hope they plan to provide them .
Are there any money management services you recommend ?
But in a very beautiful and kind town .
My town has good food , good people , a beautiful environment and an interesting history .

So , I wo n't go anywhere today .
I want to go back to sleep .
Are Japanese thin ?
My father is as tall as me , he has white hair and he is fat .
Then my teacher said , `` fat ! ? `` .
She and the other pupils thought that Japanese people are usually thin .
But I did n't think that he was very fat , like foreign people are .
But he is a little fatter than me .
And they knew of `` sumo `` , so they said `` sumo wrestlers are fat , are n't they ? ``
So I 'm very happy that they know of `` sumo `` .
It is difficult to explain , but I always ruin my life .
When everything is bad I try to be strong , happy , helpful , and cheerful , but when everything is great I begin to seems sad , and nervous .
maybe someone knows the answer or has an idea . Write as soon as possible !
You can take ESL ( English as a Second Language ) classes which are held in the United States on your TV .
The class is held in New York City in the United States .
So if I wacth it , I could take the class with them without going to New York .
The teachers speak only in English , and students do too .
I think that it 's a good chance for someone who is going to study abroad in the future , but also anyone who want to study abroad in their own home !
Today I finally got my new ID Card .
At noon , after I had launch , I went to the railway station ( and bought OR to buy ) tomorrow 's ticket to go to NanJing .

Hey .
Today , I 'll introduce myself !
I 'm 17 years old .
I 'm still a pure boy .
I 'm gon na go to America in March .
I always get confused when I try to understand English in movies and music .
I love COKE !
So I 'm getting fat .
Recently I 'm terrible .
anyway , I 'd like to talk to anybody !
If you love ice creams , you should go there ! !
This store specializes in electrical work .
The new supervisor of soccer was decided yesterday in japan .
Talking to a Senior Director
The director required me to talk about the department .
It will snow tomorrow .
If it will , I have to take a train tomorrow morning .
Today is my first day after the break .
My throat felt sore , but now I 'm ok .
So , I had six lessons today .
They were : music , biology , Ukrainian language , PT , English and geography .
I ca n't start a note in my notebook .
Can someone give me advice ?
I work for an advertising agency .
My office need us to have high English skills .
Last week , I was watching that Akira Ikegami show on TV .
He is a famous journalist in Japan .
The theme was the problem of guns in America .
In that moment , I understood usage of `` HOW MANY `` more than the problem of guns .
You might be surprised that I learned English 15 years ago , but still do n't know how to write a journal entry .
One of my colleagues asked me to tell her about a Smartphone .
I use iPhone and She wanted more information .
Is that the name of a Smartphone ? `` .
I do n't get it .
I realized that even an intelligent person can be an idiot .
This weekend I had my part time job .
It was really fun .
And this weekend was the end of my training for delivering .
The training was n't very fun .
and today I started delivering by myself .
He swallowed some poison
and set fire to the clothes that he had been wearing .
When he jumped off , he intended to shoot himself in the head with a gun ,
But when he jumped and pulled the trigger , the bullet cut the rope .
As he fell into the sea , the fire on the clothes was distinguished .
and the water took the poison he swallowed , he spat it out .
where he then died of hypothermia
I tried to find out another way to get back my home today .
I figured out that there are many different ways .
Then , I was able to return home by taking the other roads .
It was a great experience for me !
I 'm not sure where we 're going , but we 'll be sure to go somewhere where we can have king crab . My boyfriend may not want to go , because he always feels tired . He 's yawing at the moment , but I will make him come along .
I went to Nara with friends : ) Do you know about the Nara prefecture ? ?
It is near Osaka , and Kyoto .
There are old temples and historical places .
Also , Nara park is a famous spot in Nara .
In there , many deer walk anywhere in freedom : D They look very cute : ) and are always calm .
But they were following us as soon as they understand that we had cookies for deer .
Deercookies are called `` Shika - senbei `` in Japanese .
I was surrounded by deer , so I felt scared a bit .
I had a scary experience yesterday . ( good sentence )
Oh , I am very tired : p
Big and Heavy . . .
I went to my mother 's house to help her .
He had a lot of stuff .
Some are very large , or very heavy .
We decided to call a salvage company to haul them away .
School finished early and the weather was fine , so I went home on foot .
Lately I often walk for the sake of dieting .
My weight has increased by 1 . 5kg ! !
OMG X ( That 's why I walk but my legs got a little muscular .
I heard muscle is heavier than fat .
Is it effective to walk when on a diet ?
What is the best way to go on a diet . . . ?
I just watched the movie `` High School Musical 1 `` .
I wish Troy and Gabriella would get along well in the movie and in real life as well .
and I 'm going to the eulji university
I am going to have a nursing class .
it is very difficult .
and I have lunch at 12 pm
and then I 'm going to talk to my friend .
this is the end of my first English diary entry !
Is it common to meet relatives during on New Year 's Day in your countries ?
If you 'd like to search for any synonyms in Japanese easily ,
I suggest that you should use this dictionary .
I often use it to enrich my Japanese writing .
Now I 'm searching for English version like this .
Do you know some good websites ?
Exchange language
Hi again , this time round I want to ask for someone 's help who is learning Spanish .
My interpersonal skill for English is better than my writing however I need more practice .
I do n't mind if your interpersonal skill for Spanish is not very good , I think that if we work together , we can improve our qualities .
If you are the sort of person that I 'm looking for , please contact me .
I ran to work as I was listening to MJ 's songs this morning in wet weather gear because it was raining hard .
I wanted to run more , but I did n't have enough time because the dance lesson was waiting for me .
The songs gave me a lot of energy to run .
I 'm going to run home , listening to his songs , again ^ ^
It 's not my business but their own .
My wife always told me that I should write about serious topics , using formal words and expressions like what other Japanese people do .
What kind of topics do you usually talk with your friends ?
Do you often use formal words and with a straight face on your usual conversations ?
No way .
When I was still living in Japan , I always chatted ( conversed ) with my friends about many topics , ranging from the size of our dicks to the cause of global warming in Japan .
More than 80 % of our topics were quite stupid .
However , this is a real communication . Do n't you think so ?
I 'm not saying formal English expressions are not important .
But writing and reading about only serious topics is pretty boring for me .
In my opinion , hitting on a local girl , making friends with the locals , and having arguments about the Japanese porn cartoon industry can improve our English .
If you do n't know how to use bad words , it means you ca n't curse other people . Therefore , you ca n't have an argument with a native speaker .
If you do n't know how to describe something by using stupid expressions , it means you ca n't make other people laugh .
So you ca n't make a local girl friend and and make friends among the locals .
Why ca n't you become stupid on Lang8 ?
You really want to improve your English , right ?
I 've written about the primary games before .
But yesterday 's game was not a primary game .
Yesterday Korea played its first game of the finals with Greece .
I do n't know what is different between ' the final ' and ' the finals ' .
Lee jung su and Park ji sung each scored a goal .
The funny story is that today I was looking at Naver
People said he has such nice manners .
He has shown class even though his country has no money .
I saw pictures about that .
Korea 's next game is on the 17th with Argentina .
I 'm sorry to Argentina , but I hope Korea will win that game too .
Today our country has a match with Argentina .
Argentina is known as a great soccer power .
So our country is also a little worried about getting our asses
stomped . LOL too funny !
I hope so !
My brain freezes , and I guess the only thing I do n't forget doing is breathe .
Sometimes I think I would never be able to keep my gen in the database of the world . ( ha , ha )
Making a breakthrough wo n't be easy , but I suppose that 's I have to face the challenge eventually .
When I was chatting with my friend on Facebook , she told me about this great SNS service that I had never heard of before .
Probably , I will become addicted to this SNS and try to upload my dailies ( daily thoughts ? ) .
So , I have to write something about myself .
Recently , I am really interested in one book . This book is not a novel or essay .
This book is titled `` How to eat 3 meals - a - day for 9000YEN a month . ``
Now I really admire his style and am trying to absorb his ideas .
However , if I try to adapt to his diet , I can not eat a lot of meat . . .
( I was thinking of going to a hotel restaurant to have breakfast today . ) - more natural sounding
( It is said that to go to hotel restaurant is a good way to refresh our mind . )
( Having a meal at a different place makes us refreshed . )
( Last night I went to bed early but I was in bed until 8 o ' clock in the morning . . . )
to shock somebody
I know that if you `` shock `` somebody , it means that you `` make them surprised or upset `` .
Does it furthermore mean that you `` make them sad `` or `` hurt their feelings `` ?
Time flies duringclass .
When I entered through the door , I greeted my classmates in the class .
After two hours , the class ended .
I like to study English all the time .
One of my band 's members , Hide !
He 's kind of a crazy guy .
He built a studio in his apartment last year because
he did n't want to pay money every time he went to
Just once , the neighbor knocked on the door angrily , but that was really fun !
However , we 've taken it down since the day before yesterday and
finally , we re - built it today !
Most of my band 's members work as carpenters so
they really knew how to de - construct ? it .
Someone taught me how to use the `` business use machine `` and I pulled nails from the hard wood .
It was the dullest work , and made us so tired .
We 're a band of musicians , but today was different like we were
While we worked all day , I thought our bond got stronger
I hope that our musical bond gets stronger like todays work .
Hello - Introducing Myself
It ` s my first time on this website , and I don ` t know how to use it appropriately , but I hope that I will meet new friends and they will help me .
I would like to speak English fluently , but I do not have friends who speak English , so I have been learning English for several years , and my knowledge is still not enough ! ! ! !
A year and 5 months have gone by since I left Japan .
I can say , it went by slow and fast .
( I know only North America 's lifestyle as I 've never lived in another area . )
Many Japanese people who I 've met here said , they want to return to Japan , but they do n't want to work there ( in Japan ) , because it 's difficult to find a job with the same working conditions as in Canada .
Monthly salary in Tokyo is definitely better , but you have to work late everyday and work even during the weekend .
Once they get used to working overseas , it might be diffcult to return to Japan .
I do n't know why , but Japanese people , especially the one working in Tokyo are extremely busy .
I 've got mixed feelings , I feel like returning to my former job , and living in Tokyo since my friends are still there , but I just ca n't return to that lifestyle .
I thought my capability to learn would only grow until about 20 years old , as well as my height .
After that , it would decrease with age .
For example , when I was in high school , my grades were so bad that I could n't enter a med school .
I gave up my dream of becoming a medical doctor and I entered another university 's Faculty of Science .
But there I studied very hard .
And in my research activity about oncology , I thought I did n't have any choice but to enter a med school to study the medicine .
Eventually I became a medical student .
( In Japan , in February there are entrance exams for most universities . )
Snow fell yesterday early in the morning but it melted .
Today is a little bit warm .
Maybe spring is around the corner .
I made a few plans .
On Saturday , I 'm going to hang out with my friend and we will ride our bikes .
I had a problem with our plans .
I already made an appointment with my otherfriends .
Are there any solutions that allow me to keep all my plans ?
I like foreign animations .
I like `` Foster 's home for imaginary friends `` the most !
Such a story can not easily be seen in Japan .
I have poor English skills , but someday I want to speak it well because the animation is very interesting .
From time to time I am going to write something interesting here .
It is located at the center of the Crimean peninsula .
There are just about 600 thousand people living here .
I 'm sure of getting a bad score .
My name is Rin .
I 'm studying English for business .
Though I read many English documents lately , I do n't understand very much of what they say .
Everyone , please help me learn English .
Today , I went on a business trip to Kawasaki city .
I always go to Kawasaki city on business trips , because our parent company is in Kawasaki city .
Usually when I go to Kawasaki city , I go to Yodobashi Camera , Toukyuu Hanzu and Bic Camera for shopping .
And so I sometimes eat ramen around the Kawasaki station .
Because I often eat ramen , I have gone to all ramen restaurant around the Kawasaki station .
We had a good day last sunday .
We were so luckly .
It did n't rain when we were outside .
When we were leaving it started raining .
Do you like tulips ?
Have been to a Tulip festival ?
I like it though .
All people put their clothes on .
Some + people wear classy clothes , others wear shaggy ones .
First of all , people choose their clothes themselves everyday .
Clothes can express people ' sClothes can express people 's feelings .
This indicates that people + can express their characters throughout their clothes .
Secondly , I hear that clothing 's color affect + the people who put on the clothes .
For example , a man who puts on a red tie tends to become a more agressive man , but a man who puts on a blue one tends to become a more relaxed man .
Some girls say that they feel calm and womanish when they wear Japanese traditional clothes .
By the way , I must admit that a lot of workers can not decide what to wear .
Police , doctors , and forces must wear certain clothes .
This may be evidence of no relation between clothes and characters .
In conclusion , clothes have certain influence to people 's character .
People choose their clothes by their character .
I started Golfing ! !
I 'm going to go golfing next month .
It will be the third time I have ever gone to a golf course .
Although I got an old golf club set from my friend , there are some problems with playing in Tokyo .
Golf courses are usually quite far from the center of the city .
And playing is expensive , too . ( more than 15000 yen ) . .
I often go out to coffeeshops .
Usually , I go to Tully 's coffeeshops and
my favorite coffee is always `` Today 's Coffee `` .
Of course , I have a cup of delicious coffee when I go to there ,
but my real reason for going is not only todrink coffee .
Rather , I go to there to study English and read books .
I am able to maintain betterconcentration there than atmy home .
I want to improve my English
because I want to talk with people from foreign countries .
I want go to overseas some time .
I 'm sitting the TOEIC exam next Sunday .
I 've been preparing for it for months ,
I think it 's important for me to spend as much time and energy as possible studying for the exam , but it 's also crucial to keep in shape .
One more thing , I have hay fever , so I 've got to try not to sneeze
We are very lucky it didnt rain yesterday .
About 36 thousands runner ran around central Tokyo .
The course , organizing , volunteering and warm cheering were all excellent .
Today , my friend and I went to play mahjong .
It was the first time I went to his home .
To my surprise when I came to his house , it was very clean .
like nobody living there ! ! ! his parents goes to work .
I lost my money , my friend said that I am stupid .
To get revenge , I ate his two bananas .
so I am happy .
Please tell me how this would be in Japanese :
`` Happy birthday dear Mother `` or something equivalent to this phrase .
I can read only Katakana and Hiragana so if please write some phrase with kanji . .
Please also a transcription = )
It has been about one year since I took my college entrance examination .
My teacher told us that we would have a lot of free time after the exam , But I 'm still busy .
I still have many things to do .
Some things I like but some things I do n't like .
I must write news stories every week and learn Korean .
I feel tired but productive .
Today is Thanksgiving day , and I am at my friend 's house .
I ate , slept , and watched TV .
I 've taken a nap at least 7 hours in the last 4 days , and I eat my fill every day .
Christmas is drawing near , and I watched lots of advertisements on TV .
S . , and I noticed that people celebrate such events grandly comparing with my country , Japan .
This is one of the reasons why I feel comfortable in the U .
I wish to study in a European country .
Are there free courses in English which train in the humanities in your country ?
Thanks so much !
It 's difficult to practice writing if you do n't know what to write about .
Do you have some ideas or do you know a website where I can get ideas for some good topics ?
There I improve my speaking and listening skills while enjoying conversation with native speakers .
Today I went to such a cafe on the way back from job again .
As long as time and money allows , I 'm going to seek that kind of cafe and find new world .
Just looking ! !
So , we went around the mall .
But there is not one that she wanted .
So , we did n't buy anything , just windowshopped .
It took one hour for us to get there .
And we will have to go to the another shop which is near my house .
I walked around the large park near my apartment for about an hour , because I really needed the exercise .
Even though it was dark near the road , a few people were jogging .
I was envious as they seemed so healthy .
After leaving from the park , I went to buy some food and drink for my dinner .
I got them at a recently opened supermarket .
It 's a quiet store , and the prices are low .
We are a group in a community who have the same target . . .
Ok , I will start with the ladies . . .
There 're 6 ladies in my community includeing me . . .
The majority of the ladiesmade me think that ladiesin this present day do n't want to be just a house wife . . .
They want to have a career too . . .
They are working for the government as civil servants . . .
1 is in the tourism sector and the rest , I do n't know . . .
I think as long as time goes on , we can be closer and I will ask her then . . .
The rest of the ladies are jobless . . .
Not really jobless , we just do n't do anything for incoming money . . .
1 is just waiting for her master class start . .
And the rest are job - seekers . . .
And that makes me the youngest in my class . .
The other one is working in one of flying companies . . .
And the rest , I have n't gotten more information from him yet . . .
I 'm not an easy - going girl since I do n't know all of them . . .
I just started to be friends with some . . .
Being friends with a lot of people is really interesting . . .
If I can wake up early tomorrow morning . . .
I want to make lunch .
I am looking for an efficient way of learning foreign languages .
What do you think about Rosetta Stone , the software for learning a foreign language ?
I went to catch squirrels last Sunday . The rain made the hillsides became a little wet , so we should watch our step and tried not to fall down .
I took a reservation in the best restaurant in Roppongi : ) Ca n't wait !
I arrived at home . I came home .
My friends are also worried about their future .
I hope that all of us will be fine .
I wore warmlothes because that day was very cold .
But my hands were as cold as ice !
It rained , so we had to chat in a restaurant most of the day .
We almost did not ride the attractions .
Because we ate a lot of great food which I wanted to try before .
There is lots of good food at Tokyo Disney Resort !
Is the food good at other Disneyland locations ?
I 'd like to keep a sort of diary here . I think it would be a great chance to improve my English .
In fact , it 's really poor : - (

Every year my mother gives me an advent calendar even though I 'm 28 years old now .
One week ago , me and my mother went shopping together
But I found an advent calender that I had n't seen before .
It was big and looked like it had nice chocolates inside .
I read what it had inside .
my mother came to me and she said `` oh do you want that now `` .
I thought you were an adult .
Today I opened the 1st .
It had a big yummy chocolate inside just as I thought .
The day before yesterday , the results of the 153th TOEIC test was announced on the internet !

I like to watch movies .
I usually rent a DVD at a rental video shop .
One of my favorite movies is `` Innocent Steps `` which was produced in korea .
It is a romantic comedy that describes a love story through a ballroom dance .
I loved watching the dance scenes and I highly recommend it .
I Attended a Lecture
Today , I attended a lecture meeting about the teaching of English as an international language .
A professor from the University of London came to my university as a speaker and lectured us in English .
As you may know , my major is far from teaching English .
The reason why I attended the lecture was to see how English speakers made presentations in a formal situation and how the audience asked questions in English .
I learned so much from the lecture !
For example , I understood that students who asked questions needed to tell the lecturer their name and affiliation before asking questions .
My technical presentation class teacher advised me to attend as many lecture meetings or conferences as possible before making my presentation .
I want to attend many lecturesand conferences !
I came back to Lang - 8 today , and now I will restart my English study .
Let 's cheer up ! !
I have my wisdom teeth .
I had two of them pulled out one year ago but I still have two on the / my left side .
I 'm free at Thursday but I think the dentist I came to see lasts time takes Thursdays off .
Pulling out takes two day , because the dentist has to check the place where the decayed tooth was after it is pulled out .
Recently , I have had a lack of sleep because of work .
I 'm very sleepy .
Have been mixing reality and dreams a little .
Which is a little bit dangerous .
but I have made an interesting discovery .
it will be to find a new one . ?
When your feeling dull and sleepy , you become less concerned about the small stuff .
I enjoy reading magazines .
I love reading business and technology magazines every month .
My boss orders these magazines for employees and we can read these magazine
I can learn about new technology from these magazines .
Today 's journal entry is about what I 'm afraid of .
The hints to the answer are listed below ,
1 ) It is usually at home .
2 ) It has tremendous power .
5 ) It is good at big and dynamic tricks like punching , kicking , slapping . . .
If you know the answer , please comment .
It has been drizzling all day here .
The drizzle reminds me of the dew on the tea - leaves in my hometown , which makes me think of the green tea from my hometown .
Green tea is my favorite kind of tea . I especially love to sniff it while it 's in the cup . I have fond memories about this tea .
Every spring , my mum took my elder sister and I to the tea fields to pick tea leaves .
When my mun and my sister were busy picking the tea leaves , I liked to find birds nests in the trees .
Now , when I am tired , I make myself a cup of green tea .
I love green tea .
How about a drink ?
I slept for over 12 hours today .
I can not remember the last time I had to sleep so long .
After I woke up , I went to a Thai restaurant where a my friend works .
I had a Tom kagai , and a Pad ( ? ) thai there .
Even though I do not like junk food , it is cheap and easy to buy .
So , I tend to eat them more often .
Anyway , I just wanted say that I had slept well and ate a delicious meal .
It 's been a long time since I quit my job .
That means I have not used English for a long time .
But , is that the excuse ? ?
One of my friends began to study English and he introduced this website to me .
Is it a long dream of me ? ?
The Japanese Tea Ceremony
To tell you the truth , I do n't know anything about the Japanese tea ceremony because I 've never learned about it .
Since I was younger , I have n't liked both the tea ceremony or the Japanese flower arrangement because I do n't like wearing kimono .
Right now I regret it because I ca n't explain anything about them .
I knew that when we had the tea ceremony , both of my friends were very nervous .
All I could say was follow what other people is doing .
It has a long history .
It was a habit for them .
Today , our plan was wearing Japanese armors , but it did n't work .
Of course , we can see a very lovely Japanese garden .
There are some victims who suffer from pollution .
They worked in some American , Japanese or other international companies .
These factories are not concerned about the environment .
They release waste water without proper processing .
That 's why people get ill .
Mexico 's government established very strict laws to protect labors and eco .
The labors in Mexico do n't get proper salaries .
They works in very terrible places .
The factories bribe Mexician authorities .
When China has cheaper costs for labors , factories move there .
What they left in Mexico is pollution and discarded factories .
The corrupt authorities make people suffer and tortured .
I hope the situation will change so badly .
Since I have taken English classes from junior high school to university , finally I have my own opinion .
I am a person who ca n't speak and listen to English well either .
Even though in my opinion , my English is better than ordinary Japanese people , it 's still a little bit . . . . .
: ( Anyway , I 'm still unskilled at English .
Why Japanese ca n't speak and listen to English well ?
First reason is that Japan is kind of isolated .
I mean , no country borders directly with Japan .
But when we pass over the borders , we have to cross the sea .
So actually , Japan has fewer foreign people than other countries , which border with others .
I hardly ever come across people who use English as their native language ( for example Americans , English people ) when I hang around a street .
So Japanese people do n't often have an opportunity to run across them and communicate with them .
We do n't often have the chance to be stimulated by foreigners either .
The second reason is that ways of teaching English in Japan are a little wrong .
: ( In most Japanese English classes , we do n't need to listen to English very much , let alone talk in English with classmates .
If you are n't called on in class , you wo n't speak any words except for chatting with your friend .
The lyrics of a new song
These are going to be the lyrics of my new song .
It 's a really short song and was inspired by my friend 's idea .
Because I was able to tell my students my thoughts and feelings .
I spoke to them from my heart !
Not thinking , just feel .
I do n't have a good word to explain it .
I got off at Ueno Station to eat my favorite Ramen , Ichiran , but the shop was closed .
My girlfriend asked me to have dinner with her , but I could n't make it because I had a lot of work to do today .
I wore a new business suit , but it rained when I went home .
I love languages , in particular , the sound of English .
It feels like the beautiful flow of water to me .
But sometimes I want to throw everything away .
I just envy people who are smart .
Umm , sorry , I 'm negative today , is n't it ?
Today , I returned home late .
It is 1 : 30am and I 'll wake up at 7am tomorrow morning .
I felt that I need to improve English for listening and speaking .
The cherry blossoms have come out later than usual .
Now cherry trees are in bloom in Japan .
hello everyone .
This is the first time that I have come here .
I would like to improve my English day by day , and also wish that everyone who read this paper has a very nice day .
On this day all the people seem happy and excited .
On this day all the schools , banks , government offices and many other stores close to celebrate .
A lot of families in Canada go outdoor picnics in the park and invite their friends to have a good time .
they do barbecue , dance and many fun things .
People congregate in a particular place with their families to watch the fireworks .
People enjoy seeing the colorful and strong sound .
On Canada day all the people have the day off and they go outside to celebrate .
I think the best day in Canada is Canada day because you see all the people wear the color red and be happy .
Yesterday , I finally finished my exam which lasted for two weeks .
It was really a tough time since I do n't like the subject that I am studying .
I am studying business which is not my first choice .
Originally , I thought that it was great for me to study in this field .
But after these several months of study , I think I am not a person who is keen on studying business .
Luckily , I finished my exam already , and I can celebrate Christmas wholeheartedly
Japan 's national soccer team became champion in the Asian Cup ! ! ! ! ! !
I think you should decide to keep the maintenance time on a regular basis , because a lot of people have signed up to this site lately and you will have to keep the configuration simple and clear all the time .
Let 's say , once a month , maybe on a Monday for three hours , would be convenient for everyone .
I do n't recommend it on Saturday , the high time for users from the viewpoint of customer service .
Take care of yourself and thanks always for your great job .
I am practicing listening to English .
I still do n't understand the difference between `` l `` and `` r `` .
My son is in the first grade of junior high school .
He has n't finish his summer homework even though school starts tomorrow ! His Junior high gives the students loads of homework .
So I told him that he should work on it little by little every day from the beginning .
Despite my advice , he procrastinated until today . . .
He is drawing a picture of a Gundam for his art homework now . . .
Of course , he wo n't be able to prepare for the test on the first day after the holiday . . .
Tiring Day .
I came home in the morning hours because of my birthday party last night ( ? ) .
I spend some time with my boyfriend .
He and I ate the broiled small intestines of cattle .
And then we chatted in my car .
Yesterday , I was confused about what critical thinking is because of the comment : `` a lack in critical thinking in Japanese education . ``
Quoting Wikipedia , `` Critical thinking consists of mental processes of discernment , analysis and evaluation . ``
In short , in my opinion , critical thinking means thinking and analyzing by myself , in order to decide what I want to or should do when facing burning questions .
However , in Japan , people still think that normally it is polite to try and form a consensus without struggling against someone else because Japan is harmony - oriented society .
Thus , Japanese people , including me , may be poor at critical thinking .
We tend to comply obsessively with Japanese customs .
Thanks to this awareness , I made up my mind to try to put `` critical thinking `` into practice .
I found this good website and I thought it can help me learn english better .
Actually , I 'm not good at English and I 'm afraid of speaking in it / English . . .
During my winter vacation , I 'm studying English and writting a composition ( one ) / compositions ( more than one ) everyday .
By the way , I 'm also interested in Spanish . If you want to learn Chinese , I can help : )
there is water on the moon
The rainy season is coming to Japan soon .
Which season is your favorite ?
But I love / prefer summer : ) I will go to the beach and pool this summer !
I could n't go there last summer .
I 'm so excited !
I want to learn English a little better and I want to speak English well , please help .
I want to try tweeting one sentence everyday .
I want to try tweeting one sentence everyday to study .
Please , reply for me !
This week has been too hard .
this semester will finish in 3 weeks , so we are enjoying the finishing party .
And yesterday , I worked part - time in an amusement park called ' Everland '
I counted the number of visitors in front of the souvenir shop to 08 : 00 from 22 : 00 .
I nodded off when I was standing .
I wanted to tell the answer , but I felt scared and I did n't know the way . Why were you scared ?
I realized I should have taken the chance to talk with a foreigner .
Thank you for correcting my English and explaining the difference between article `` a `` and `` the `` : - ) .
I only understand a little about it so I 'd like to study English XD .
Today , I had a doubles tennis match and we lost it ; ( .
But ! ! ! ! Tomorrow , I have the singles tennis match . XO !
I want to win that one ! ; ( ! ! !
And now , I 'm going to play on my home court because I need to practice for the match tommorrow : ) !
In Japan we can get many kinds of fruit .
so we often overeat . . .
I have an alarm clock that I bought last year .
The old clock is an atomic clock , but sometime it shows the wrong time .
When it misses the waves , sometimes it shows the time significantly wrong .
The clock is n't an atomic clock and it does n't make a tic toc sound .
Its design is very good .
Let me introduce myself .
My name is Jin .
I am 26 years old .
I moved from Korea to Los Angeles , California 3 years ago .
I wanted to learn English and health care .
So I started to study them .
I was better than before but I felt that my language skills are not good enough yet .
Anyway , it does n't matter because I ` m going to try to learn them every time .
Anybody , ' give ' me some information how to improve English skills faster .
It takes me more than 20 hours to get there from my area .
It takes me 9 hours to get to Moshi from Dar .
When we got to the Selengeti camp site , it was 6 o ' clock .
Now , I am working for the Japanese department in my office .
Our desks are next to the American department .
I always listen to their English conversations , but I still ca n't fully understand ( white and black people 's English are very difficult to understand for stupid Japanese ) lol .
Sometimes I observe other departments during at work .
And one of the American workers was having his birthday at that time .
They started taking photos of each other .
Oh , if it 's possible , I want to be born in Europe or America in my next life .
When I lived with my family , I had a rich breakfast because my mother cooked for us .
My mother and sister usually had bread and coffee , but my father and I preferred rice and miso soup .
At that time , I did n't realize that my mother had to work hard early in the morning to cook various foods for us .
I really appreciate my mother .
When I started living by myself I did n't want to spend a long time making breakfast , so I had some fruit , soy milk , and cereal or bread .
It only took 5 minutes to prepare .
Sometimes , I miss having breakfast with my family .
I also miss Japanese style breakfasts .
I would add a little soy sauce and natto , too .
Eggs and Natto are high in protein which help build muscle .
If you have a chance to come to Japan , please try TKG
`` Do n't talk about it .
I thought he really liked me , but I blew it ``
I have not studied it about four years , so now I 'm so tired .
not me , but my best friend is in a plight .
she just heard about someone saying bad things about her best friend , and she told it to her friend .
her best friend got angry when she heard it , so she and
the person who smeared her had a fight .
made a mistake in this .
I want to reconcile them .
I study English everyday because I want to work in a foreign country .
But it 's difficult to do it in my company , because my company has no branches in foreign countries . . .
I like my job in my company , and my boss praises me .
But . . . since I am working at this company , I do n't think that I will be able to go abroad on business .
So I plan to change company , but I am hesitant .
But maybe I will switch to a different company , and then in a few years I will be able to work in a foreign country !
If you are interest in her post , please go to her page and help her too .
There is a very vernal fragrance here in Sendai where I 'm living , today .
We have been feeling scared recently because of the earthquake , but the fragrance would warm up our hearts a little .
I really hope that I can have `` Ohanami `` and enjoy eating and drinking together with my friends , when the cherry blossoms reach full bloom in this city .
For example , we exchange presents with each other , drink , and eat cake on Christmas day and the children believe in Santa Claus .
Japanese people are very good at importing other cultures .
Almost all of Japanese enjoy Christmas but Japanese Christians make up only 1 . 2 % of the population .
Moreover the Japanese Christmas has no relation to religion .
Its religious meaning was lost during its import into Japan .
Why Japanese people have been importing Christmas , is because Japanese people are fond of Western cultures .
For this fews years we have been importing Halloween .
I finished packing for Taiwan .
is 5 : 30 AM , but the correct time is 4 : 30 AM ( not 5 : 30AM ) .
It is difficult for me to fall asleepearly onthe day before the trip
It does not ache all the time , but I feel sore when I eat something hot .
It seemed to be getting better , but I accidentally bit the sore part and made it worse .
It becomes better , I bite it , it swells and aches again , gradually subsided , then I . . .
I went shopping yesterday and bought some stuff like bacon and eggs .
I did n't want to pay for it , so I refused it .
After shopping , I tried to go back home .
I saw a bus coming and I decided to run .
As you guess , the eggs were broken inside my rucksack .
When I opened my bag and saw liquid eggs all over the place
Now , the egg dried in my bag , it looks like semen .
It would be a shame if someone saw it and thought that it was semen .
To be clear , I have never had semen in my rucksack before .
I listen to rock ' n ' roll and dance music in the morning .
This is because I want to listen to rhythmical music in the morning .
My favorite musicians are Michael Jackson , and Beatles .
I listen to soft music at night .
I especially like Enya .
It is very relaxing .
This is the first timeI use Lang 8 at school .
I do n't think I cansuferon this website because we do n't haveaccess to facebook , which may be the same as .
But I was wrong , I can use it ! !
I have n't thought about what I will do after school , perhaps I 'll go back home and then sign in the facebook .
I make a Skype telephone call this morningwith my family in Japan and I missed them abit .
But that 's ok .
I will meet them on the end of July .
Water is an unstable thing .
It can pass almost all obstacles .
Why do we have to waste our strength to swim upstream ?
Just let loose your body , think like water and let the water bring you through the banks of hard rocks
I wrote in my diary a year ago .
Today , I cut my finger with a broken glass when I was washing the dishes .
There was a grandfather and a grandmother .
They had a grand - daughter , Mashenka .
Her - friends wanted to go to the forest for mushrooms and berries .
They called on Mashenka to ask her to go with them .
As I thought , I rarely remember to write anything .
It 's not the first time it 's happened and it annoys me , but there 's no helping it .
It mentioned some American conservative commentators censured President Barack Obama 's gesture when he met with Emperor Akihito in Japan .
Then , the President greeted him with a handshake and nearly 90 - degree bow .
The commentators criticized the behavior , according to the article .
In fact , the President would be criticized for his / her behavior even if anyone else took up the post .
I know they were nitpicking at the President , and it seemed to be childish .
They should know the proverb : When in Rome , do as Romans do . . .
May 13
Today I practiced a card trick .
Also , I make a card trick routine .
I bet with the office people .
As a result I lost betting .
I bought coffee , patbingsu , and pizza .
So I am sad ; - (
My older brother is Sin .
He made balloon animals .
He always works hard .
He is my role model .
I showed a card trick in English class .
But I made a mistake doing the card trick .
I was sad .
But one more time .
I had success .
Today is Saturday and so I have no school .
I was reading books all day .
I read `` The Shadow Over Innsmouth `` .
I remember , I had nightmares as a kid after reading this book .
My first day with a foreign friend on the internet
It is quite exciting for me to make contact with foreigners .
I have always dreamt of making friends around the world .
Today , I took my first step .
I know a Japanese user on lang - 8 .
Thanks to globalization , a Taiwanese person and a Japanese person can chat in English , we are able to communicate on the internet even though our mother tongues are different .
He studied in Australia , his English is pretty good .
Being afraid of offense , I was very nervous at first .
However , his friendly greeting really helped to relieve my nervousness .
It is , I think , a good start .
I hope to make more foreign friends .
I 'll go to see a `` Blue man `` show in Tokyo Japan on Saturday .
After the show , I 'll have dinner with my colleagues at a hotel .
Usually I drink Sake or alcohol at dinner .
However , this time I refrain from drinking it ,
because nobody drinks it except me .
What do you think ?
See you later
Sometimes , I am able to hear other people 's voices .
One day , I telephoned my friend , when I hung up the telephone , I heard something .
It was my friend 's voice .
What a strange experience .
Then , I telephoned my friend again and asked her if she said that , to my surprise , I was right .
My favorite author is Dan Brown ; he is genius .
Unfortunately , I have only read two of his novels .
They are The Da vinci Code and The Lost Symbol .
I like The Lost Symbol more than The Da vinci Code .
While I was reading , many things surprised me .
The Lost Symbol is the best novel I 've ever read , and I suggest everyone read it .
Wasting time
I will probably go shopping or sleep .
Do you know where Shimane prefecture is ?
It is in west Japan , at the nearest place to South Korea .
I lived in Iwami from 2001 to 2003 for business purposes .
I had many experiences , happy ones and unhappy ones .
It made me grow up .
She is a person who supported me .
Looking back on my past entries , I 'm pretty surprised how horrible my English was , and at the same time , happy to see improvements in myself .
I 'm not a college student , ( but I 'm ) working hard everyday and sometimes using English .
The below is my description that I made for this product but it would be awesome if you could correct the way so that it sounds more natural and maybe humorous .
Starting from the cube in the box , which is composed of tiny little magnetic balls , you can create millions of different objects just like how it is shown in the video below
I have spent so much money ever since I started sharing items here at FlutterScape . Hahaha Tokyo is awesome !
I had two reasons for rent this DVD .
I recommend this movie .
Composition 0720 , please help me correct it or provide me with some ideas . Thanks ! !
It is often not a good thing to move to a new city or a new country because of the loss of old friends .
A number of people maintain that it is disadvantageous to move to a new city or a new country due to the loss of old friends .
While some people 's first reaction may be to agree with this statement , there are compelling reasons to explore it in more depth .
As I see it , moving to a new city makes me strengthen my friendships and broaden my horizon .
First and foremost , moving to a new city makes me own opportunities to show my old friends how multicultural and various the new city is .
Take my own experience , for example .
Because of living in a new city , I was able to invite my friends to visit an interesting city .
I had chances to become a tour guide to show them around my new city , Taipei .
Taking them to beautiful places they did not have chances to visit before would strengthen our friendship and allow them to have a good time .
Without moving to a new city , I would not have had opportunities to share innovative things with them .
Therefore , it was beneficial for me to move to a new city .
Moreover , I would benefit from living in a city which I have never gone to before .
I broadened my horizon in a new environment .
I made a number of new friends who have different cultures and backgrounds .
I was also able to go to the museums or exhibitions to improve my understanding of the customs , culture , and history of the new city , which refined my taste for art .
In addition , I could go to the university by MRT rather than bicycle since there is a convenient public transportation system in Taipei .
On the contrary , if I had not gone to a new place , I would have no idea about what a developed city it is .
Consequently , living in a new city opens my eyes and creates more opportunities for me .
In conclusion , not only did moving to a new city strengthen my friendship , but it also helped me get to know this world .
There are a number of advantages for me to put myself in new circumstances .
However , I feel confident that the reasons I have mentioned above are stronger .
I have published a number of very short journals on Twitter .
If you follow my web page on Twitter , you can understand what I 'm writing about .
Do n't look back , ever .
Life is short .
A person 's life will end .
Everybody knows that .
The hedgehog is a kind of animal with thorny surface and a tender internal .
The two lead character in this book are both fond of solitariness , refuge from others and themselves like the hedgehogs .
Through anecdotes , the author infers some questions worthy of thinking from a common place life .
It 's a book about philosophy
I did not understand it the first time I read it
But after the second time , I just understood what the author meant
In such a society where everyone is like a hedgehog , and how do we keep gentle ?
Under the cultural difference and identification , the main character pursues the meaning of her existence all the time .
There is a lot of despair in life , but the beautiful time also exists , that is eternal < < time can not be beautiful > >
I 'm bored now .
so I am very bored .
Use of Clutch
I have a question concerning the use of `` clutch `` .
When I watch a baseball game in major league baseball ,
I often hear `` a clutch hitter `` or `` a clutch pitcher `` .
In this context , the word , `` clutch `` functions as an adjective in order to describe
someone that is strong , especially when he or she is having a
capital chance , right ? - Yes , exactly !
`` If I quit the job , wo n't you miss me ? ``
I gazed at him for few seconds with a suspicious look .
He looked embarrassed and had a shy smiled on his face . `` . . .
But I 'll forget what I said today because I 'm stupid , `` he continued . .
When I got on the train and found a seat , tears were running down my face .
`` You told me you wo n't miss me even if I leave ?
I believed what you said completely at that time . . . `` I thought to myself .
I always want his words but he 's not good at expressing ( verbalizing ) his thoughts .
It leads to frequent misunderstandings though . When small things that I notice every single day compile my heart , they turn out my humble wishes . ( ? )
I felt like I was empty inside .
I saw the movie ' Life Is Beautiful ' .
I will never forget it during my whole life .
The movie is about the period when the Jews were slaughtered .
A Jewish man meets a pretty woman and they fall in love with each other .
So they get married and they have a son .
But the German army took over and they were imprisoned during the Holocaust .
But the father tries to keep his son .
He does n't lose his sense of humor .
He lies to his son .
He says , `` This is a game .
We will try to win this game .
We will get 1000 points so we can get a tank . `` In the end , the father succeeds in keeping his son .
But he dies .
I think he is a good father to his son .
They were in the worst situation and he still tried to be cheerful for his son .
My situation is not the worst .
So I will try to be a bright person .
Do you like to travel ? ( at least looking at places to travel to online ) .
Generally , travel sites force users to enter their personal data first .
Wanderfly does this very well .
I had been working to make the site a success .
Hello ~ ~ my name is Tim , and I come from Taiwan .
My personality is easygoing and outgoing .
I 've been a member of a guitar club at school .
If someone has any question , just ask me .
Fell asleep again
When I was laying beside my youngest daughter , I fell asleep again .
I was thinking that I 'd log < space > on to the Second Life to see my friends , but I could n't .
I was also trying to do that last week , so I missed it for two weeks .
I 'm wondering if I could log < space > on to the SL next week .
Social Networks
What a pityful day . . . . . . . .
I have low motivation every Monday . . . . . .
The temprature was good this weekend .
By the way ,
I have a few social network accounts , including this one ( Lang - 8 ) .
I like Facebook chat .
This SNS is only supposed to be for Japanese people , and I use it to keep track of my Japanese friends .
It is a great service .
I 'm too lazy to customize my page with HTML , and some pages have too many applications .
They make my computer slow down .
Many friends of mine switched from MySpace to Facebook .
I guess I will delete my MySpace account too . . .
Waiting for my mom to come home , I prepared all the things to make chop steak .
But she came home late yesterday , so I put making a chop steak off to today .
It 's my first time making a chop steak .
He told me that he also wanted to come to my house and have dinner together .
But I do n't think it 's a good time to introduce him to my family .
I hope I will be good at cooking and cook a treat for everybody .
I went back to Tokyo for a bit , but now I 'm in Fiji to take part in a home - stay program .
I think 98 % of the international students are Japanese .
I heard that it 's popular to study in Fiji nowadays .
When I go back to China , I 'll try to write about my stay in Fiji . . .
I wish I had friends who could speak English !
What do `` wanna `` and `` gon na `` mean ?
Does ' ' wanna ' ' mean ' ' want to do ' ' ?
Does ' ' gon na ' ' mean ' ' want to go ' ' ?
When do native speakers use these words ?
I had some vegetable juice .
Not only because Chinese New Year is coming ,
I hope I can achieve my goal smoothly : )
The road is still long , I know it 's just the beginning ! ! !
I could take a rest for about a week , but I know I have to keep praticing ! ! !
I 'm really forward to the graduation trip ! !
This winter is too cold , I hate cold weather ! ! ! ! !
After that I had to reinstall the system , which took me about 5 hours .
The new hard drive ( WD 500G , which is about 40 times larger than the broken one ) cost me $ 52 US dollars .
Although bigger is better in the PC world , the old one meant a lot to me .
The broken hard drive had served me for about 8 years , and there were also some important archives stored on it .
Yet I still regret that this old hard drive finally goes to the end of broken .
I like to listen to music while at work .
I listen to music even while I 'm at work .
I listen to music at ( my / the ) office while I work .
I even listen to music as I work at the office .
I even listen to music while I 'm working at the office .
( Which are most natural ? )
Today I 'd like to write about my husband .
He is 33 years old and he originally comes from Chiba .
He works for the same company as me .
He has studied English for a long time , too .
He took a private lesson two years ago , so he speaks English better than me .
I 've been taking a private lesson 1 . 5 hours per week since May .
I 'm not feeling well
I caught a cold and have had a headache for two days .
But I had to go to work today . When I went to work , it made it worse because nobody answered my message : (
Today , I had an English class called `` Holistic English `` .
He is funny and pretty knowledgeable .
I took out my contact lenses box and sat it on my desk .
He picked it up and asked me what it was .
I did n't know how to say `` contact lenses `` because I even did n't know this word .
I went on a trip to Thailand with my family for the recent four days .
I went shopping , swimming , ate delicious food like kaopa , tom yam kum ( actually very spicy to me ! ! ) and experienced a facial massage .
Durind the trip , I could experience many things which I can not experience on ordinary days .
I 'm listening to good music .
Good morning , really good morning .
Despite having a bad dream .
My name is Amber .
I work in a department store .
Firstly , my English is very bad .
So my friend told me about this website .
I hoped that I may learn English .
Because I really want to learn English .
She makes beautiful , exciting music and performs perfectly .
Great visual imagery / visuals .
It only has basic instruments like a piano , bass , guitar , and drums , it 's very simple , but we need nothing more , the band is just perfect .
She is not only talented , but also so beautiful and sexy that I would sleep with her if she wanted to ( maybe not ) .
An expert said , `` When you say negative words to yourself , your brain has only negative images .
My husband and I go grocery shopping every weekend .
( there ) were Christmas shoppers who was rushing to ( do ? ) their Christmas shopping .
It 's kinda depressing to imagine massive traffic jams on this upcoming weekend .
So I planned out the dishes and games for the party and we also prepared the prizes for the games !
That 's one of my favorite restaurants .
This time , I ordered : 6oz Sirloin steak and Caesar salad and baked sweet potato with honey syrup and marshmallows .
My husband ordered ( a OR the ) big brownie for desert .
I even felt like ( I could hear my heart racing ) because of this high - sugar sweets ( I imagine . ) Anyway , That was a lovely night .
I really like staying / to stay at home .
Sometimes I read ( book ? ) and listen to - classical music . I rarely & nbsp ; watch TV usually watch except the news or some films . And & nbsp ; I often study in the evening
I stay at home all day and eat hu tieu ( vietnamese rice noodle ) .
I made an acorn Totoro .
The materials are acorns , a white pen , a black pen , and green paper .
It is better to boil the acorns because the insects will come out .
At last , stick on a leaf made from ( the ) green paper .
It is easy to make it and it 's so cute !
I always drink a cup of cocoa , before going to bed .
I 'm working at my office on sunday .
My office needs to help many customers ? So , Saturday and Sunday are working days for me .
So my children are spending time with my husband .
I 'm very sorry for / about my family because I ca n't spend time with them .
This morning , the snow is falling outside .
The powdery snow was flying up as I walked to Minami Urawa station , and I felt a chilly breeze .
Now I 'm writing a journal at Urawa Central City Library while sitting beside a large window .
The snow is likely to stop falling soon and beginning to settle .
The ground of the whole world is covered with white snow right now .
When I was a child , I spent several years in a mountainous region .
In those days , I wondered why such beautiful pure white flakes fell from the sky and melted away from the ground .
Snow flakes are the masterpieces which nature creates .
For my morning practice , I 've been listening to NPR .
At first , I was comforted by the girl 's * meow * .
Maybe I 'm getting too old ( ? ) .
I think that on the sports day we should abolish events that encourage students to defeat others .
I ` ve been feeling bad for the past 30 minutes .
Last week my friend got married and I hosted his post wedding party .
We played a movie of the histories of both the bride and the bridegroom and a movie that contained the message from the bride 's family .
Some unexpected incidents occurred but we made it ! !
It was so busy but yet it was aslo a very happy day ! !
NICE TO MEET YOU
This is my first diary .
I hope to see more of Lang - 8 .
I am good in Japanese Otaku Culture , for example , Manga , Anime and niconicodouga .
I Especially like ' Dragaon Ball ' .
Dragon Ball is a very interesting Anime .
But I have not watched the recent Dragon Ball movie yet .
If I get enough time I 'll watch it .
I 'm looking forward to watching it ! ! ! !
Welcome back , robins !
My husband and I had just had a talk about bird nests yesterday .
We have an apple tree in our backyard in which a pair of American robins nested and laid eggs the year before last .
We were looking forward to seeing the pair raising a brood .
But unfortunately their eggs did n't hatch , and they abandoned the nest .
An unhatched blue egg was left behind in the nest , and one was cracked on the ground .
Last year , no bird nested in the tree .
Maybe my husband had cut back the branches so short that they were not suitable to make a nest in .
I look at the nest from the sidewalk so that I do n't scare the nest - owners .
I hope that I can hear the chirping of her brood from the nest .
And , I sometimes get errors which is line in the display .
I have already been using it for 3 years .
I 'm still thinking whether I should buy a new one or not .
If I buy it , I want a camera which can take a good shot in a dark place .
Terrible Cold
I caught a bad cold last week .
At first , my nose was runny and I could not stop sneezing .
Then one night , my nose was totally stuffed up and I could not breath at all !
I could not sleep .
Now I am dizzy and I can not hear well .
When people talk to me , the voices sound like they are coming from 30 miles away .
It feels like a piece of paper is covering my ear .
I am so sick right now .
I hate having a cold .
My nose is still stuffed up as I type these words .
I wish I get better soon .
I have lost my interest to write an entry .
So , I 'm only doing corrections for the time being .
I just stay at home and do some homework on house decoration . ( I plan on doing some house decoration in October . )
When I accidently found this place , I said Wow .
Today I have lots of work to do . I have to prepare a report for my boss and also do some house decorating .
I think it 's time for me to go job hunting because doing work on the weekend is n't really something I like to do .
I 'm preparing the introduction for my British history term paper .
but I am afraid that I have a lot of mistakes . .
The History of England is very profound and complex .
It comprises a huge number of events and the persons , who influenced . them .
In each epoch there were key moments and interesting figures about which it is possible to read volumes .
I consider that one of the most ambiguous figures of English history is the representative of the Tudor dynasty , and daughter of King Henry VII - Maria the First or as she is also named - Bloody Mary .
This name is still shrouded by a set of secrets and legends .
There are no monuments put in her homeland . People associate the period of her reign with bloody massacres ; the day of her death - also the simultaneous day of accession to the throne Elizabeth I - was marked as a national holiday .
We see the picture gloomy enough , but it has interested me in this historic figure .
Having read about the queen at a history lesson , I have started to search for every possible information about her . For instance , I have read various books and watched films that are connected with her personality .
When I have looked in English serial `` Tudors `` , about this great dynasty , I became assured that my term paper will be about Maria .
I wanted to learn more about this strange , fanatical queen who has been doomed to give a large quantity of death to innocent people .
In my work I have tried to track Maria 's life from birth to death .
I have collected every possible legend connected with her , and the facts of her biography , which prove that this person was historical and noteworthy .
In Romans 8 : 8 it says : `` So then they that are in the flesh can not please God . `` We make decisions everyday .
Is it from my flesh or Jesus ' will ?
My face must look like the dark clouds .
It 's like when Peter walked on the sea to Jesus .
If I look around at the world and not focus on Jesus , my flesh will be activated .
However , our Lord is so good , He saved Peter before he sunk . ( Very nice ! )
Adjusts our attitude .
Guides us .
I have no idea what I should say .
I wish my English writing skills would get better
I hope when I writing the theme of Economics & Accounting , I do n't make the same mistakes or at least do n't have a lot of mistakes . . . .
I hope to be a better girl
I hope I can have more goals of my own .
I hope I can do evereything by myself and be a strong girl
can it come true ? ?
How hard am I trying for the above ?
I need someone to support me
I am lost , confused about myself , my future . . .
Karaoke party tonight !
Sorry , I ca n't write English well tonight because I 'm drunk and
We only have 2 hours left in the Easter holiday . . .
I want to play paintball next holiday . .
I was working hard for one week to prepare my oral presentation .
First of all , there was a lot of work in preparing the data for the talk .
I finished my / the PowerPoint slides by midnight yesterday .

I 'm not good cold weather . with
I do n't use an umbrella everyday ,
because my house is situated near the sea
and the wind is very hard there .
I will need many umbrellas .
Now , I live at a fully - furnished guest house .
But , I will move to a new , bigger apartment in September , because my family will come to Germany from Japan in November .
Interestingly , when Germans move out , they bring all the things in their room , including the kitchen appliances , light bulbs and bath tub .
So , my new apartment is just empty !
I have to buy everything myself .
This system is better for people to make their own rooms , but is not good for transient residents like us .
I wonder how much it will cost to buy furniture , electronic equiptment , , , .
My friends calls me Haru .
I usually leave my house at ten thity .
There is much It is going to rain tomorrow .
Today I had an online English speaking training session at RareJob , but there were some problems .
Sometimes I could n't hear the teacher 's voice , and at one point the Skype connection was interrupted .
Some people had written about Rarejob 's Skype connection in their blogs .
One blogger wrote , `` I remember the teachers who have good internet connections , and seek them out each time . ``
I realized that that was good advice . I 'm going to do that too .
My classmates
I have two best friends in my class .
They make me happy everytime .

My 14 month old son
Just after the birth , I did n't feel I was happy with a baby because I could n't sleep at all .
But time was the cure .
language is one of the core aspects of competition
I 'm tired of translating from Chinese to English , so I 'm writing this diary without translating .
I know my English is very poor , but I really like learning it .
Currently , global businesses has been driven largely by competition . In my opinion , language is one of the core elements of competition , especially English as it is very important in both work and study .
I am 15 years old in school level F . 3 .
I live in the small city of Macau , which is one of the SARs of China .
Apart from English , I am also studying Japanese because of Japanese anime and music .
But recently I focused on Japanese too much thats why I have neglected my English studies .
So I decided to resume my studies by writing in my diary here .
I blame myself for studying English for 10 years without any improvement to my standard .
My ability to hear in English is very poor and I have a limited vocabulary .
Of course writing is one of my weaknesses as well .
So I really hope I can improve my English on this site .
If I can at least first start with writing .
the day before yesterday I saw my cousin wearing hair extensions .
so I asked her about the extensions .
`` How much did it cost ? ``
then she said `` only Rp 4 . 000 . ``
' ' Wow ! That 's so cheap ! ! ``
I want to buy hair extensions too !
Can you help me to buy some coloured hair extensions ?
' ' okay , I will ask my friend first ' ' she replied
I want five of this colour . . .
one set only costs Rp 4 . 000 . . .
that means 5 sets only cost Rp 20 . 000
it 's okay , that 's not too . expensive .
she sent me some messages
saying that out of the colours that I wanted , only red and purple were available ( ? )
I 've begun an interview process today to hear potential user 's opinions directly .
I 'm worried about whether there are people who want to meet me to get information about my apps .
I gave up piano when I was in junior high because I had to study for exam ( s ) .
I have had the flu since Tuesday morning .
On wednesday I only worked till 10 o ' clock . I had a fever so I went home .
Later in the day I took medicine and the next morning I felt better . I decided to go to work .
At 12 o ' clock I was more or less good , but later I felt weak again .
I took today and tomorrow off so I wo n't infect other people . That would be a problem because the whole company would close .
Currently I 'm feeling better . I spent all day in bed trying to heal up .
I hope I 'll feel better soon , tomorrow max .
I like listening to English podcasts very much .
They 're free and there is a lot of interesting information you can get from them .
It consists of all English , so it helps you to think in English .
I especially recommend words from the Beginner Lesson which explains word 's meanings in simple English .
I went to a sushi restaurant with my parents
My mom likes sushi so we sometimes go to sushi restaurants .
We have a favorite store ; that store 's staff is kind to us and tells us fun stories .
I eat a lot of sushi if I go to there .
I do n't like wasabi because I cry if I eat too much wasabi .
I know that most foreigners do n't like wasabi either .
Do foreigners say Japanese horseradish ?
I am a 1st year university student in Japan at Kyushu university .
Everyone who is studying Japanese , let 's talk !
My favorite things about foreign culture are the simpsons , oasis ( band ) ,
I went to Dallas with my friends for 4 nights , and 5 days after I finished my summer classes .
I thought they would fight but they would not ; they showed judges the Kung - Fu forms and the judges graded their performances .
We stayed at my friend 's aunt 's house and they have 4 kids and we have 4 kids with us . I learned that kids like a person that pays the most attention to them .
Well , this was about my road trip .
I am going to make a new entry when I come up with a topic .
One of my dreams .
I have gone there since last year .
I 'm am never absent from there .
But I do n't study in my home .
So I 'm not good at speaking English .
I 'm trying to study everyday at home from now on .
And I want to speak English smoothly .
It 's one of my dreams .
Tomorrow Friday . Tomorrow is Black Friday .
It 's good for people , but my American friends . say they wo n't go there because everyone goes on Black Friday and the stores are packed .
I started to use Lang - 8 today , the first day in 2011 .
I stayed in England for a month up to two days before Christmas eve in 2010 , which was the first trip to a foreign country for me .
This made me recognize that communication to others , especially people not only Japanese , is very fun .
Since my English is very poor , I was not able to talk to a lot of English people .
By using Lang - 8 , I would like to improve my English skills and make friends around the world .
- in Korea ( While the host is not even thinking of serving cake , the guest drinks the kimchi juice first . ) Very interesting saying !
Soccer is more popular than baseball .
Soccer balls are bigger than baseballs .
Baseballs are harder than soccer balls .
Baseball is as popular as soccer .
A baseball game is as good as a soccer game .
Soccer players runs as fast as baseball players .
Several months ago , I went to Mount Tai with a friend of mine and her mother .
she lived in shandong province , so I went to her home first and visited with her mother .
after resting for a few days , we set out on the journey !
Mount Tai is a famous tourist destination
as soon as we arrived , we drew up a detailed plan .
We decided to start the climb at 7 o ' clock pm .
Then we could arrive at the mountaintop before sunrise .
Mount Tai is famous for it 's sunrise , but not everyone who comes can see it , because there is a strong weather factor .
We 're SO LUCKY ! We saw it .
I took lots of photos .
It was a fantastic journey .
It 's the 3rd lesson , and I want to learn how to sing .
But sometimes I really hope I can enjoy singing like others do .
This music class may do me some good , but I am not sure .
Because last time , we sang a sentence for the first time .
Our homework was to learn a song and sing it in tonight 's class .
There , I will find out if I have learned how to sing .
The temperature was probably less than 10 degrees .
But I really felt happy as I heard the motorcycle 's engine in front of my salon .
It was a Kawasaki , which has a masculine image .
He took a motorbike tour in Hokkaido this summer and he almost when around all of Hokkaido .
I have been there on my motorcycle long ago too , but I have n't gone around it yet .
His story made me happy and inspired me to do the same thing .
Studying for exams is very , very interesting .
Studying is good , because it helps me learn a lot . ( ? )
I like to study accounting especially , because I find it entertaining and useful .
So then , let 's start studying again .
A few months ago , I went to Ueno Zoo .
Ueno is located in Tokyo , Japan .
I wanted to see the two pandas .
When I looked at them , one panda was eating bamboo grass , and the other one was sleeping .
Pandas are very cute animal .
I love pandas .
But before we could see the pandas , it was necessary to stand inline for a long time .
I did n't like it .
Because it made me tired .
It rained all day yesterday .
I like rainy days .
I do n't know why , but I just like that sound .
Is there something to eat on a rainy days in other countries ?
In Korea people eat buchimgae on a rainy day .
but our family did n't have buchimgae .
How come we forgot about that ?
Instead we ate chicken and watched the world cup .
fm is a language study site .
I studied sixty words a little while ago .
By the way , I had a dream that I took a skateboard to school ,
but I fell in front of school .
He is amazing !
I like his skateboarding style !
I took an examination in Physics today .
But I still have tests in , mathematics , English , German , and electric circuit .
So this evening I will eat out with my friend .
Maybe we will eat ramen .
I 'll start to write this diary again .
Two years ago , I had to study for an entrance examination and was in trouble .
To tell [ you ] the truth , she is a vocal synthesizer .
Not only pro singers , but amateurs can [ also ] create their own music .
Some people sang vocaloid 's songs and made their debut as pro singers .
I think it is interesting that anyone [ can ] make [ music ] , lyrics , and make HATSUNE Miku sing .
Thanks to her , we [ have ] various ways of enjoying music .
For example , `` KAITO `` is one of the vocaloids who sings in [ a ] man 's voice .
I want to try creating my own music someday .
I think it is better that I go sleep and be happy instead .
My friend just left me now so I have no one to talk to . : ( haha sounds sad but not that much . . .
[ What interested you about libraries and information science ]
Actually , I accidentally entered this department .
Then I saw this department and I was n't sure about what this is going to teach , but I thought this might have something to do with computers which I 'm quite interested in , so I decided to give it a try .
I have plenty of things I like to do , like drawing , designing some handicrafts , singing , baking , playing volley ball , listening to music , etc .
I guess it 's because I like to make something myself which will make me feel a great sense of achievement .
Summer break here begins from the end of June to the beginning of September .
it is important for my live u .
But it does n't get any better .
Last night my father came back from work and glanced at me and said , `` I think you 've gained weight somehow . . . ``
I checked my weight on the scale . Oops , I did gain 4kg .
I know it 's not that big of a deal , but I wanna stay in shape .
This morning I started to work out and run , and did it just now .
Noy is still in front of her computer and will maybe spend more time with her computer to do alot of things .
but she will occasionally come to Lang - 8 to write her diary .
she can stay at her house without the boring hot weather .
I hope today is a good day for my friends on Lang - 8
This song is old but while you help me correct my journal I would like you to enjoy to listening to this song too .
thank you so much for your help .
Hello , I live in Ukraine . It is not a very big country , but it is a very beautiful and old country ! ! !
Ukraine has a very old history . Many tourists from other countries come here ! !
We have many places where we can spend time together !
I hope you will help me with my English . ) )
This one is the latest and biggest news piece in Japan .
It is said that he killed a British 22 - year old woman who was an English teacher living in Japan .
( I do n't remember exactly how old she was . I am sorry if I am wrong .
He has had plastic surgery many times . He has changed his own face and he has been running from the police for nearly 3 years now .
I heard that both of his parents are doctors . He was smart and he went to a great college .
So I thought maybe he had a lot of pressure mentally and that might be related to this murdering rampage .
I think that 's one thing we must never do .
I thought he might find it relieving if he would be arrested .
I read a news article about this on the internet . It said that someone said he is a good looking man .
I really feel sorry for the victim ; a lovely British woman , her family and also for the murderer 's family .
I wish for world peace without horrible murders like this , disasters and all bad matters ! .
While I was talking with my coworker today , I seemed to have been just seeing my coworker .
I tried to change my focus that I looked at my feelings several times .
All my coworkers are kind to me , so I 'm usually happy when I work .
I want to be honest with my feeling .
And then I always feel happy .
My clinic does n't have so many patients .
But once some patients come in , they talk about their lives , so I also talk about my feeling a little .
It was fun .
I 'm happy with everything today .
I 've become a premium member
I 'm a newcomer .
Though I visited lang - 8 for the first time only a few days ago , I love it .
I guess the company which runs it needs cash .
So I 've decided to pay for premium membership .
I hope the company will grow large like facebook .
Sometimes I have many daydreams and during these daydreams there are many random things in my head , I sometimes feel that I want to meet all my friends in the past and think that now it is impossible to do that : (
I knowthat it 's past time and they are busy with their activity : 9 how sad it is to be separated from each other .
This is the reality of life . : / bad things and good things have become memories in my head
actually I saw over 500people yesterday .
it was just beautiful . we sang for God with all our heart .
Based on my experience , those saying Japanese is easy to master usually turn out to have an insufficient command of the language .
Today 's opponent is the strongest team in my area 's college .
I will do my best .
Today , I could n't be motivated to do anything .
My school classes start next week .
I thought that although my mind did n't want to go to school yet , my soul or my body might .
Whether I like it or not , the time is coming .
We will stay there for about a week .
We will not swim in the ocean .
Read books , listening to music and forget about daily life in Japan .
I do n't know much about the Philippines but I 'll try to find something that I have never experienced before .
I hope to have a good conversation with the local people .
When I went back to Japan and had another trip to Kagoshima , in the southern part of Japan , I asked for that fruit .
But I could n't find them and asked whether I could find it in the supermarket .
Everyone said that they had never seen Rambutan nor heard the name .
Actually , it is prohibited to grow rambutan in Japan .
for some on - sale items that can be used in my study area .
I want to create a coffee shop - like environment .
I always enjoy to study in Starstruck or Panera Cafe .
Last years I bought some $ 2 Paintings and one $ 20 stainless sink and some very good quality table tops for only $ 5 each .
Some day , I will go to NY to see her .
This is one of my dreams .
Many dolls are displayed on a tiered stand for dolls .
I like the five musician dolls named ` gonin - bayashi ` .
They play a flute , drums , a hand drum , and a gong .
One of them also sings a song .
Today I played a yut contest in the church .
I 'm feeling good .
To whoever reads this stuff
I did n't sleep during class .
and went back home where I ate a one - pot dish cooked at the table .
Afterwards I went to English cram school .
Some of them are really wonderful , however , some Podcasts are hard for me to understand .
I need to listen many times before I can catch them without the learning guides .
So I got an a idea , that I 'll translate the content of famous English Podcasts into Chinese , learning by this process and sharing with all of you guys !
Please help correct my mistakes .
However , from now on , I decided to write my daily routines in this website frequently to improve and practice my english writing skill .
When I was a child , my dream was to own a dog .
When he stood up , he was as tall as me .
When I got back home , I would say `` hello , I 'm home ! `` .
Then the dog would come to me with his tail wagging .
Because I have a job , I do n't have enough time to take care of a puppy .
However after I read some dog magazines I began to imagine living with a dog .
Now , I want a Welsh Corgi !
Do we need English as official language ?
They think if they continue to use Japanese as the official language , they ca n't employ people from overseas that ca n't speak Japanese but have excellent skills .
Furthermore , Rakuten intends to sack corporate officers if they are not willing or can not learn English within two years of its decision .
The number of employees that ca n't use English also will be reduced .
I heard that they use English at meetings now , even though all attendees are Japanese .
Some Japanese bloggers say that it 's an excellent decision because Japanese employees will be able to communicate with overseas employees and customers more easily than before if they learn English .
Usually people from overseas can understand English even if they 're not from English - speaking countries .
On the other hand , there are people that criticize it .
Even employees that possess a high command of the English Language ca n't convey detailed intentions in English as well as in Japanese .
Japanese employees will not be able to communicate well with one another .
It will bring about adverse effects on the firms and employees .
I totally agree that English is important for global communication .
What do you think about it ?
A student cheated on the Kyoto University 's entrance exams .
Meanwhile , it attracted controversy due to Kyoto university 's and the media 's actions .
Some people reproach not only the student but also the actions of the university and media .
My English teacher told me about this web site , so from today I 'll try to write English diary entries .
I went to my English teacher 's lesson today , but it was his last lesson
because he will go back to his country next Monday .
I 'm a resident doctor in Japan , yesterday I worked in emergency
room throughout the night .
Today I had to keep working
Hello , everyone !
I am new in this website .
I want to learn English well .
I hope someone can see it and help me by
modifying my article or introduce a good way of improving English .
Also the day after tomorrow
Also comes the day after tomorrow .
A Few months to make the target by myself .
It also gives us the power of oneself .
I must learn English , but everyone knows my level is too low .
When I was a junior high school student , my English class teacher laughed at me , because my pronunciation was unique for him .
Every day I 'm very busy because of my life and job .
Only when I study a foreign language do I feel happy .
A good speaker maybe is not a goodworker .
I am not a good worker , I always have some mistake .
I took my sons to a Barber shop this morning , and then to a one coin shop , `` Daiso `` .
My 2 - year - old son likes to be held in my arms .
I usually say to him , `` Let 's walk with your own feet . `` , but he replies , `` Hold me in your arms , please ! ``
Because he had the opportunity to buy his favorite snack .
I met a boy online last night ,
, and chatted with him for about an hour .
He is working in the US ,
and he told me that my English is more fluent and better than that of his coworkers who came from China .
Many of them have worked and lived there for a long time , but their English is still not very good .
it is funny .
hope I can bear to live in another province or city .
Many Japanese parents go to the shrine when their babies turn one month old .
It is called `` Omiyamairi `` .
It 's purpose is to give thanks for a healthy - born babies and wish them to grow up healthy .
The babies wear kimono when they go to `` Omiyamairi `` .
I have n't written a diary recently , but suddenly I wanted to write today ,
It 's a fine day !
It is a very nice day in Tokyo .
but it is a little bit cold .
Many people in the affected areas are having troubles .
What can I do ?
I will save electricity & gas .
I want to help the helpless .
I want to give hope to the hopeless .
Can You do anything ?
I dropped my iPod touch in ( a / the ) toilet bowl last week and it sank .
I only bought it three months ago , but in this case the problems were caused by water , so it was out of warranty .
It was a pity .
Problems caused by water ca n't be fixed , so I exchanged the iPod Touch for a new one at ( an / the ) Apple store .
It cost me 20000yen ( about 200 dollars ) to exchange , which is half the price of a new one .
I want Apple to make a waterproof iPod .
When I was a child here in Japan , there was grounding , which ( might have ) lasted for a period .
I remember I was crying and bumping ( hitting ) the door .
Today , I went to Odaiba in Tokyo with my friend by car .
Unfortunately , today was so windy ; it was a bit hard for us to walk .
But the problem will be running out of breath . ( vv ; )
How can I write a nice personal statement ?
My teacher asked us to write a personal statement , and she showed us some examples in which there were various tragedies such as parent divorce , serious illness , and car accidents .
We Adopted a Pussycat
We heard the sound of a cat crying when we were walking and checked to see what it was .
When we saw this pretty little cat , we could n't leave it alone .
He is ginger and white with pink paws .
Now he 's in good condition and always runs and scratches .
In my opinion lang - 8 is a good idea for people who learn foreign languages ; D I ' m sure , I ' ll make a lot of mistakes but it ' s really important to try our abilities , isn ' t it ?
I come from Poland and I ' m SEVENTEEN years old .
I ' m intrested in history , literature , sport , geography , religious etc .
In my free time I read books ( my favourite - thrillers ; D ) , meet my friends and watch movies .
I haven ' t done too many interesting things recently , because I ' ve been so busy in connection with the end of the semester at school but winter holidays are close ; )
( At ? school I have German too but I hate it : P ) .
Thinking About 4 Chan by 2chan Mad
It quickly fascinated me .
It has dirty jokes and is full of vitality .
I 've been 2chan mad for a decade , and I deeply like Futaba Channel , which influenced 4chan 's culture and structure .
Using real names is rare . + and unwise +
Japanese youngsters often talk as if they are on 2chan . They talk about ideas from it , and sometimes say `` I 'm a 2channer `` .
But it was a decade ago when 2ch began .
So I should get used to the new way now , possibly .
They enjoy throwing dirty words around .
And I think they are less problematic .
Compared to 2chan , their hatred seems disorganized .
On 2chan , they attack mainly weak people . Especially Koreans or Chinese in Japan , integrated people , women , and anyone with a percieved weakness .
They throw dirty words at each other .
they call everyone `` faggot `` .
Gay or straight , man or woman is not an issue .
They call Gay as `` faggot `` , straight as straight `` faggot `` .
They call white people `` pigs `` , and black people `` niggers `` .
So , there is a weird equality .
But I think it 's better to see Tokyo tower at NIGHT !
And other photos are of Zojoji temple .
Hello , everyone , I have come back .
Thank you for all your care .
Yesterday I went to a book shop at 11 . 00 am .
I read a lot of books there , and one book taught me how to write English well .
It said one should follow the sentense form new paper or book .
and then read it again after one has finished finished writing it .
I tried to do that today .
I will see if my English improves or not > <
I hope that this tip may be good for my friends from here .
I went to Tokyo on a business trip this week .
So , I could keep a diary a little this week .
While I stayed in Tokyo , I met my friend .
And I went back to my hometown early morning today .
The soccer game of Japan will start right now .
Everyone is not alone , for it is ery people that consist of the society .
On one hand , some of the people hold this view that one should be rewarded after doing a good deed .
No doubt , it is kind of traditional Confucianism .
For my part , I firmly believe that one who has a kind - heart should be given a reward or aapplause .
Because he or she deserves it .
It will have a positive effect on public as well , which would inspire more citizens .
At least , the public media , namely TV station and newspaper , not only should report entertainment news , but also propogate news of these outstanding ordinary citizens .
To sum up , more attentions should be paid to those kind - hearted persons .
Hi ! I 'm Keito .
I am 14 years old .

There are smart partners in famous stories .

UK GP coming to 5 days ! I do n't know
I can read Japanese but ca n't type in Japanese . . .
I have sooo many stories to tell about Monaco .
It was a sunny day .
There were some 4WD roads near the camp site .
Because we just got 4WD car .
The road was very very bumpy , so my body was flaying around all the time .
I was worried the car would roll over .
Finally , we got to the goal ? !
there was a beautiful beach !
We lied down on the beach for a while .
After that we went back to my camp site jumping into the car again . . .
Miso is a soy fermented condiment .
Nice to meet you !
I have been learning it for more than
I have an enjoyable time each lesson , In addition I feel comfortable when I carry out the procedure for making tea .
I can relax and concentrate like
But I 'm not sure about that now .
Of course I still have many friends but I ca n't be sure that they are really my friends honestly .
I think it depends on each person 's thinking about friendship ( ? ) .
We have known each other more than 10 years , since we were in elementary school .
Now we still contact each other , but I do n't think that she is my good friend anymore .
When I think about these things , I feel lonely .
In Japan , there are not any traditions of having a long summer time vacation , as in France .
I think I am oversleeping .
Summer holidays
The second term is finally beginning .
It is a fine day today .
I have a teachers meeting and folk dance workshop for students .
I have two holidays , tomorrow and the day after tomorrow .
I want to go to an Onsen and relax .
Today is the 5th of August .
Do you have any stupid things ( happening ) in your life ?
I had something stupid happen this evening before I came home .
It happened when my boss told me about a new rule :
if an employee does something wrong or does not concentrate on doing work and makes a mistake ,
she will reduce our pay .
What a stupid idea .
I just got this job about one and a half months ago , do you expect me to be perfect ?
My boss expects it .
I think once I pass three months I will improve .
I want to get more friends
Hi , everybody .
Can you find me more friends ?
My English is very bad .
I always make mistakes in grammar .
I want to make friends with who can speak English .
I like to make friends .
I will share my life and my feelings with you if you will be my friend .
In fact , it 's just been half a year but I feel like it has been so many years .
For I have been studying in another city for one year .
I have become very homesick .
On July 11 my friend and I went home together by train .
It took about 9 hours to arrive in Hangzhou .
I ca n't believe a song could make me feel so sad . It had really nice lyrics though .
Anyway I really enjoyed it for making me cry T _ T
But it seems troublesome for her to write a journal .
She has a second name , Aurora .
She told me it will be easier to talk with foreigners with it .
Do you think Asian people 's names are difficult to remember ?
There is a swimming pool that is located inside my neighborhood .
It belongs to an elementary school .
The main purpose of the pool is to teach children how to swim .
People are not allowed to jump in the water at the end of the pool because it is too dangerous .
The price is 50 NT dollars for an adult .
I used to swim 500 meters everytime I went there .
I want to increase my range of swimming .
To make swimming more cheaper for me .
A lady I know waved to me . She is a friend that I met when I went to swimming school last time .
I was so happy as well that I still could a friend who still remembered me after one year .
and she always encourages me to swim quickly .
I could get down to sleep , but once I woke up in the middle of the night , it was very difficult to go back to sleep again .
But all the things made me stay awake even more !
I do n't know why that insomnia had started and ended .
But it does n't work for me .
I 've had a cold since the day before yesterday . Not heavy , though .
This is the first time I 've had a cold this year .
My voice is nasal now , and does not feel very good .
But they never work .
I will just wait for my cold to go away .
Maybe having a good sleep is the best way to cure a cold .
I will try it .
But I do n't know if it will work or not .
I took a medical check - up just a month ago .
I drink but not like a fish . Sometimes I drink that way , though .
LOL I am a member of a sports club .
I know I should exercise more and lose a bit of weight .
I want to live for a long time and be healthy .
Today , I joined lang - 8 .
By talking with them , I can know various senses of values , and people who are elder than me kindly tell me many tips for my life .
We had lunch with those whose house had been flooded in the tsunami .
Although ths house has almost been repaired , there was a waterline where the water came up to . ? ? ? ?
I brought my boxed lunch which was full .
But they served dishes such as tsukemono , sansai ( mountain vegetables ) , and some snacks in spite of having little food .
I ate them and they were all good .
I felt a bit sorry , however , they smiled at me and said `` Eat more : ) although there was n't plenty of food
All of us thanked you guys : ) `` They are kind and tough ( even if they disguised it ) .
I was encouraged to do something more harder than before .
I could make friends with many people through being a volunteer .
I decided to go and volunteer to help them again . ? ? ? ? ?
My 7th diary
I will have a lot of classes on tuesday .
And the class like micro economics is too difficult for me to understand .
Recently , I ` ve wondered why I took up economics .
But , I must study and get credit .
Once I understand the lesson , I think it will be fine .
So , I ` ll study hard and find something interesting about economics .
I 'm joining in the CPU project .
We read a book about `` How to make a CPU `` and we 're actually doing it there .
Today I used a soldering iron and made a ROM according to the book 's instructions .
After I came back home , I drank a cup of alcohol .
It often rains in the spring .
Do you hate rainy days ?
I am so fond of listening to this :
Do you think it 's good , or do n't you ?
Rainy days too .
A dialogue on a bus :
A passenger : Oh , your baby is very calm on the bus .
She likes to be on the bus .
I always write about movies these days .
Because I can find interesting cultural differences in it .
I love music and dance , so I enjoyed it : ) I was amazed many actress are able to sing , dance and act ! ! !
I became fond of her ever since I watched `` Almost famous `` .
Strangely , many people do n't understand that sometimes a man watches it just alone and some people feel shy ( about it ) .
anyway , I will just have to go the cinema alone and then buy a sweet popcorn and cola and then enjoy the time alone .
Maybe , I think that I 'm really a true man who really enjoys a movie .
do you agree with my opinion : ) . .
I am going to stay in Bath tomorrow night , so I hope to sleep well there .
When we go to bed , other people wake up on the opposite side of the earth . ``
`` there is a booger on the desk ! `` And she said to me ,
`` It 's yours ! `` I smirked .
And she said with smile on her face ,
`` Gross ! `` Yet , it sounded to me as if she had liked it .
After that short spat , the small to - do was quelled .
Even now she insists it was mine .
It was not mine .
just saying hello
`` Princess Mononoke , `` one of STUDIO GHIBLI 's greatest works , was inspired by the atmosphere of the island .
Over 20 years ago , I was trekking to the top of the island 's Mt .
I groped my way forward with the help of a small headlamp and managed to reach a hut .
I needed to have breakfast and prepare for the next step ( journey ? ) .
So I walked down the trail I had passed the night before to get some water .
There was nobody but the tree and I in the mystic atmosphere , and I felt like he had called me there .
This experience was and always will be my precious memory .
Impact of the tsunami was far beyond our imagination .
What happened to me today
When we suddenly understand the language which we have been studying without thinking , it makes us happy .
Today I had that experience while watching Japanese news .
In Japan recently we have heard a lot about brutal murders ' here and there .
One of the most famous murderers we 've been hearing about was arrested just thirty minutes ago .
After he killed a British woman who was teaching English in Japan , he went into hiding for two years .
The woman 's father came to Japan to appeal to the police to search for the murderer many times until he was arrested .
The police struggled in their search for him , and two weeks ago a tip that he had been sighted in Nagoya was broadcast through the media .
In the end he was arrested in Osaka though .
When I was watching the news , the news caster suddenly started speaking English and started to interview the victim 's father .
When I listened to the father speak English , I was mostly able to understand what he said .
Since my daughter was curious about what he was saying , I translated it into Japanese for her .
Usually when we listen interviews in English through the media , we can read subtitles in Japanese .
However , the interview happened suddenly ; the subtitles were n't prepared in time .
Therefore , I was able to listen to the interview in English without Japanese subtitles .
The father was crying and very grateful to the & nbsp ; Japanese police .
I would like to listen to news stories in English more often from now on .
If patent exhaustion were to be inevitable by conditional sales , consumers would enjoy more unconditional sales .
Under such circumstances , `` self - replication `` type products , such as cell lines or software , should require patent license replication .
I will have the first exam at my new school on Oct 9 .
I want to leave a good impression on my new teachers .
So I revise the lessions I have learnt during the holiday .
I 'm afraid I ca n't be the best in our class .
Next , I will continue revising .
I 'm looking forward to the exam .
I Wish I can get a good result .
Hello , nice to meet you !
Tomorrow , I have an interview test .
`` Tell about something which impressed you during this semester and something which has disappointed you ,
and give three reasons for each . ``
Help ! ! !
The class that impressed me during this semester was `` Introduction for ( My university name ) studies `` .
The first reason is because the lecture had a different professor each time . I could hear a unique lecture which was n't from my field .
Secondly , the points of each field are summarized in each lecture , so I could understand the educational
I have n't thought of yet X (
To make a long story short . ( am I right ? ) To be honest I do n't have a long story , LOL !
I mean a person 's fight ca n't change the world , even ca n't change himself , so it means nothing .
But his action may encourage others who know this , and year to year the world can be changed .
When I used the word `` bam `` I meant cheat .
RAVI , I want to know why did you correct the word `` born `` into `` bore `` in the sentence `` I told them maybe their moms born them in order `` , what I want to say is , their moms made a deal with their birthdays and then bore one each day in order .
I think the side effects of this medicine is pretty strong , My mouth has an ulcer again .
Last time I had this kind of antibiotic medicine was when my tooth was pulled out , and I got a mouth ucler badly , this happend again .
I stayed at home for the whole day , watched films , read a book , you know that I read some pretty good articles , books give me peace .
I bought juice which was a fruit and vegetable mixture , I thought it could improve my immunity , but it was too cold , and I had to mix hot water in . The funny thing was that I could n't measure how much hot water I needed , so the mixture was either ( too ) hot or ( too ) cold , which made my throat ( even ) more uncomfortable T _ T .
Back to the topic , I was thinking that I needed some music when I was having dinner , so I just clicked here and there on my computer ( in my computer ?
I did n't remember when I had copied them from DVDs .
I remembered that the first time I watched a Michael Jackson video , was in 1996 .
Then we rented his other VCDs from the store .
I just liked the rhythm .
After three years I listened to his music again because one of his music videos , `` man in the mirror `` I was shoked by this video , I did n't know what to say , I was impacted . Comment : Me too
I found that I had n't see all his music videos , I did n't really know him , afterward I read some information about him .
I watched Transsiberian , Burn After Reading , and Traitor today .
The benefit of illness is that I can watch films all day .
I watch Southpark for learning English , but I ca n't understand all their jokes .
I did n't watch Aqua Teen Hunger Force , but I will , you know I never miss out on anything good , LOL !
`` OnePiece `` is a Japaness cartoon , it is a pretty good series !
I had enough !
If I recall anything , I will tell you in my dream ! !
This is my first time to write something here .
I am pleased to meet you and wish to become your friend .
If you would like to learn Cantonese or Chinese , I can help you .
But this system is exciting .
It seems to be enjoyable .
I love fishing , drums , mac computers , and the iPhone
Please , let it be possible to continue .
I am still using a translation web site .
A carpenter and a plumber made a nice , new room there .
I 'm happy because the noise no longer wakes me up .
I hope to spend the days peacefully .
It will be my first experience of an American wedding !
I wonder what clothes are suitable for guests .
I heard Americans give the couple presents from a wish list . Is this true ?
Should I ask them for the list ?
I did a 60 kilometre round trip on my bicycle , including 6 kms on dirt and a 1 km hill climb .
I 'm tired , and my legs do n't work anymore .
This cat is `` JIJI `` from the animated film `` KIKI 's delivery service `` .
I love dogs , but I also like cats very much .
Black cats especially appeal to me .
I highly recommend the film as well .
I forgot what happened in last class .
miss u ( you )
A few days ago , my boyfriend went to his home ( home town ? ) to see his family and his friends .
I miss u ( you ) . . .
It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return , but what is the most painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let the person know how you feel .
I enjoyed the amusement arcade in Akihabara
I have liked staying at amusement arcades since I was a child .
I like photo booth machines , so I always take a photos inside them .
I took photos three times , and then I gave it to my friends .
I have collected photo booth stickers that my friends gave me .
I 'd like to know if there are photo booth machines in foreign countries .
I sometimes see foreigners take photos inside them .
They seem to enjoy taking the photo .
One of my friends introduced this song to me 8 years ago .
And I will never forget it because this song is really beautiful !
I was bored this morning , so decided to sing it .
Sorry if this has broken your ears T - T
I have a class this morning but I have n't slept until now .
I must wake up at 6 : 50am .
I re - register in my english class yesterday so I must hit the sack earlier than before but I ca n't sleep .
Until before , I heard my recorded voice but my voice is a little bit strange to me and I felt ashamed and funny .
What am I up doing so late ?
proofread this please
Please proofread it .
I had dreamed of becoming a singer since I was a little child .
That dream came true , but I got ill after a while .
I put my career on hold to concentrate on recovering .
At that time , I had to read many technical books and some Portuguese translations of English texts that were so poor that it was easier trying to understand the original ones .
This is definitively more fun !
Lunch at a Goverment Office Building
Most big goverment office buildings in Japan have a canteen .
These canteens have had a good reputation for some years ,
Especially they often have an original or special lunch .
Of course we ordinary people can eat there too .
These tasks sound quite related to my previous job .
Could you please tell me more about the projects and what scale are the projects ?
May I know when I can receive the result of this interview ?
I 'm new here and I joined , because I think I need people , who can correct
my writing and give me advice for my studying .
So I 'll tell you something about me .
- the worst at language
Spanish from next grade
- I love drawing , reading and playing guitar
I hope there are a lo of people who will correct my diary entries .
Osaka Prefecture University is near my house .
Although I neither am nor was a student there , I can use it , because I live in Osaka Prefecture and have the citizenship .
As long as the person is a citizen of Osaka , they can have the right to use this `` public `` library .
It has a large amount of books .
It used to close at 8pm sharp .
But now it is open later .
I can visit even on weekdays .
A month ago , my English teacher advised that we can improve listening comprehension by listening to VOA or BBC .
Because I have trouble listening , I chose to listen to the VOA special English - education report .
I listen to it almost every day .
The first time I could catch some words and simple sentences .
The second time , I read the text and translate it .
The third time , I can completely understand every word and their meanings .
What 's your advice ?
How can I use VOA better ?
UNIQLO and Their Business Strategy
If you live in or have visted Japan , I am sure you have heard of UNIQLO .
It 's among the most famous clothing stores in Japan .
I read an interview of the founder and I found it quite interesting .
His name is Tadashi Yanai , a Japanese billionaire .
He is ranked at 89 in `` Forbes billionaire list . ``
First of all , what distinguishes UNIQLO is that they provide high - quality basics with an affordable price tag .
One of their feature items is the so - called ' heat tech inner . ``
It 's a thin inner garment but it generates heat by itself . It 's very useful , especially in winter .
Most of my friends in Japan wear it for everyday use .
UNIQLO now has 750 branches including 4 branches abroad .
The greater the risk , the greater the possibility for profits `` .
In my opinion , what he said is true . However , when you are at the top , you are also responsible for your co - workers and their family .
I also believe it has some interest in luck and your background .
You may need financial support from your parents . Some people succeed very easily because of their family .
Now I just read the latest news that UNIQLO has announced that they are going to change their company 's common language to English from 2012 - 2013 in order to keep up with global growth .
I find that interesting .
It is a one hour drive from my place .
The weather was relatively mild and clear so , it was a perfect day to play tennis outside .
The place is on a hillside and we can view a river and mountains over the tennis court .
Can you see the small white part in the picture ?
I find that Chinese exams are more difficult than English exams .
I wish I could be an American in next life but can speak Chinese well .
I had more spare time than usual .
And then I memorized useful expressions and words , although some of them slipped out of my mind easily .
Well , the recordings of text books , which I regularly listen to , are piling up , so not only should I keep up with every lesson , but I should also review the back numbers not to forget the new words , etc .
`` I should not only keep up with . . . . . , but also review . . . . . ``
I met a man developing medical instruments there .
I 'd like to ask about him the industry because I have been studying biomedical engineering .
I know we will talk about many things but I am not prepared yet .
If I make a mistake , what I will do then ?
This is my first time to write a diary on this web .
I never think about being able to correct other people 's error in my native language .
I was starving , because I had n't eaten breakfast or lunch .
A lot of different meats were served one after another .
I also tried a bottle of Peruvian beer called `` Crystal ``
It 's so good for your health .
Sorry . . . Lang - 8 Friends .
I 'd like to apologize for my ' not entering this site for a long long time . '
I had to prepare my Book Golden Bell ( I got Second place . . .
but I was first in Third grade and Fourth grade : > ) , my Chinese letter test , and most of all the computer test .
At least what made me happy was that I got 100 on the Chinese test and got first place on ( the ) computer ( test ) .
Later this month , there will be a big ( test or exam ) .
I hope you understand when I do n't visit this site for a week or so .
There 's one comment that I want to tell you . ' I 'm sorry '
Is it Correct ?
We had record rain here in Japan .
Trains were stopped and a lot of roads were closed to traffic .
My daughter had to sit and wait in the stopped train for a long time on the way ( back ) from high school .
The typhoon caused serious damage to several areas in Japan .
Some houses , and many cars , were swept away by the overflowing water .
I ` m living in Nagoya in Japan .
I ` m a university student and my major is mechanical engineering .
Japan does n't have many resources .
Now I am enrolled in a university in Japan and I major in Dentistry .
Starting today , I should do clinical trainings every day except duringweekends .
I was very nervous during the training , but I managed to pass .
First , I have to tell you that . . .
and that all of my family and friends are safe .
I could n't go home on the night because of a full suspension of the train service , so I walked to my home which took hours . I did not arrive until the next morning .
It was good exercise for me .
( In fact , I was really scared by the earthquake . . .
It helped me continue to be firm .
We have faced two serious and unexpected disasters I . e . both the earthquake and tsunami .
There are people who have lost their homes .
We have recovered from crises many times .
We recovered from the Tokyo Daishinsai and the Hanshin Daishinsai .
which language should I choose ?
if you were me , what would you do ?
German - I have learned / studied it for one year , but I can only read without understanding its meaning .
Japanese - I am really interested in it , but I know nothing about it now , I like to watch japanese cartoons very much .
please you have experience learning languages , so give me some suggestions .
It has been raining all day long .
But I was still drenched with rain .
I had to change my dress when I got home .
After meals , I have to study for a driving test .
I 've failed it twice , therefore I hope I pass the next test .
Today , one of my friends told me a funny story .
She was talking to me about her trip to Scotland , when she remembered something about a t - shirt workshop .
She said :
`` We were in a t - shirt workshop , and my friends , who like a lot of rap music , decided to make t - shirts with a message that showed their passion by rapping .
They wrote the title message ( `` I love my rapper `` xD ) .
When they were walking by the street , people laughed a lot while looking at them , and they did n't know why the people were laughing .
Then , they discovered that `` raper `` in English does n't mean `` person who sings rap `` .
They were very embarrassed about this . It was very funny .
I think that it 's a funny story because there are a lot of times that we wrote something wrong because it sounded like Spanish words that have different meanings .
Yesterday , my friends invited me to a plan to go water rafting and camping with them someday .
They always change their minds according to their mood .
Although they made an awesome plan on camping , I am wondering if they will fulfill it .
Technically , you may say that they not normal so you never know what their next step is .
Moreover , I hope that our camping could be sleeping in a camper but not in a log cabin .
This is because I 've never been in a camper so far .
On Saturday , I took a solo bike ride up to the south area of Kyoto from my apartment .
There is a bike route that runs through the area along the River Yodo and then the River Kizu .
I like this route because it 's flat from beginning to end , although I sometimes it 's hard to ride against the winds there .
After leaving my apartment , I rode to the first point where I planned to have lunch .
I took a good rest there and started out again toward the turnaround point .
There are tea plantations along the river , and I saw rice fields filled with water in which the planting had been almost completed .
During the ride , many riders passed me by , as I was pretty slow .
Although I worried about getting sunburned and am worn out from all the hot sunshine , I feel great when I finish riding .
I resumed driving school .
In Japan , people have to graduate from driving school within nine months of the enrollment date .
I enrolled into driving school mid - September , so the deadline of my graduation is mid - June .
I still have three months to go .
On the other hand , the cost of getting a driver 's licence is rapidly ballooning .
Judging from the progress chart , I would end up having spent more than $ 3000 just to get a driver 's licence .
Well , most of the instructors in school are nice and assiduously tell me how to drive and to be aware of .
Yet $ 3000 is too expensivefor me .
I guess , people can get their driver 's licences without spending such an amount of money in other countries .
How much money do you need to pay to get your driver 's licence or to complete driving school education in your country ?
Today is Thursday , and there are no special / occasions .
There is only one different thing , namely , I became an hour sender this afternoon .
Actually , I do n't like / it .
I like to write / more codes than that .
But my case has finished3 months ago .
So , in addition to modifying the bug ( it means issue ) found by my client , I am not busy .
I took off at 7pm and went home by motorcycle .
I 'm asking all of you including KoreanS .
I want to join AN off - line English group but I do n't know about that at all .
This effect was that the skin would become renewed .
By the time I get married , I will have gone to Este six times .
I wonder how I will change .
we cleaned the windows , floors , and washed the curtains .
I 'm so tired after doing all of these things .
I was a couch potato
but from now on , I 'm gon na study hard and work out .
Watching Asian games was a time killer .
But like someone said `` Life is not a spectator sport `` .
As it 's getting cold these days , I just eat over and over again like a crazy person .
Suddenly I just stopped watching TV and went out for a walk .
I jogged and jumped rope .
I 'll go back to the days when I lived every moment .
I want to be able to speak English ,
My First Sign - In
I 'm using this website for the first time .
Work Hard Study Harder Play Less
I was busy at work and hardly managed the time between my job and Japanese class .
Thank God the hard work paid off .
I had a good review and salary raise .
She is a kind teacher and I like to study under her guidance .
He 's a good teacher too .
It 's troublesome for a working student like me .
I 'm dedicating my free time for productive activity .
I only understand simple greetings .
I did n't fancy the coffee but the place has a good hang out view .
At night Jakarta has a good metropolitan view with lights everywhere .
I 'm not sure how to use it very much .
I want to speak English more smoothly and learn about a lot of foreign cultures .
Doing that , I can see Japan from a wider point of view than before .
and I was very happy , I think I will be addicted to learning English .
If I can make learning English interesting and work hard , I think I will make a lot of progess !
And thanks to my many Internet friends for correcting my mistakes !
If you need help with your Chinese , I will do my best to help you !
I came Back
I came back becase the CET will be held .
It looks terrible .
It seems to me it is the devils work .
my point is , that language is used to communicate with each other .
If you understand my meaning and I know what you mean then that is enough .
Why do they hold examinations to get your language level .
I ca n't see how the test scores can really reflect our language level .
I thought about who I 've been .
I 'm 25 years old .
More specifically , I thought was that I was bad in some way and that I needed to improve myself .
What if I was much better before than I am now ?
What if I 'm headed in the wrong direction ?
One thing I am sure of is , I was n't shabby like this before . ( shabby ? )
It seems the more I try to improve myself the more other things in my life seem to suffer . ( fall apart )
I think I have really destroyed myself in some ways .
Fortunately I know how to make things good again .
THE ENGLISH LECTURE
so I 'm looking for someone who can teach me English while I am learning it by myself .
Now I 'm trying to register the English lecture for the next term .
What do you think of this supplement ?
My friend came to my house when I was about to start studying English this
morning , but we enjoyed chatting .
While chatting I recognized that she is into taking a supplement called
`` Kakusan `` in Japanese .
that type of drink is quite effective for us such as allergies , sickness , cancer , and
and diabetes . This supplement is just like an all - around medicine .
However , the price was too expensive to keep on taking for me .
people had a heated argument about it .
It made me even more confuse .
She suddenly sat up in bed , in the middle of the night .
Anyway , short story this time so you do n't lose so much time : 3 thanks to everyone for reading , correcting , and commenting n _ _ n !
today I 'm going to talk about `` friend ``
compare someone who shares the bad and good
but , most of all my best friend is like me in every way .
One of my friends , Hiroki , told me about this site .
Thanks , Hiroki !
So I want to improve my English writing skills here .
Golden Week - a long vacation in Japan
There is a long vacation called `` Golden Week `` in Japan from the end of April to the beginning of May .
The cost of travel is very high compared with those at usual times of the year .
I have not been to foreign countries during that season , but I plan to go to Hong Kong and Macao with my family this year .
There is a lot of delicious food in Hong Kong , so could you recommend your favorite to me ?
When I was in China , I only used QQ in order to chatwith my friends on line .
AlthoughI know Face Book was popular in the world .
but in China we could n't connect with Face Book , because Chinese government allowed us to use Ren Ren which was a copy from Face Book .
Maybe it was the first time that I used that , till then I could not know whether my friends are on line or not . ( , ) A lots of messages on the Face Book made me feel a bit mess . ( , ) Maybe 3 months later it will be more `` easy going `` .
Today I just went to my part time job .
Recently , the junkyard where I work is very dull .
So , today 's shift was from half past 4 until 11 .
It 's usually from half past 4 until midnight .
After I finished working , I went back home and went to bed early .
One rainy evening a lost cat wandered in . It was completely wet and crying a lot .
The old couple named her ' Mique ' and treated her like their real child .
When a customer put money on the table Mike suddenly swept the money down into a money box underneath with one cry of `` meow `` .
The customer was so delighted / enraptured that he advised the old woman to change the name of the shop from ' Kakegawa - local power rice cakes ' to simply ' Cat rice cakes ' to attract customers to the business .
In a sense a customer named their specialty ' Cat rice cakes ' .
He told me the results of the performance evaluation for the past six months .
I received the highest points in our evaluation system .
I 've never received such a high score since I joined this company .
I was delighted that the managers recognized my efforts .
I felt very much appreciated .
Honestly , I get paid much more than the average Japanese person of the same age .
In addition , thanks to this great evaluation , I will receive a huge bonus this summer .
When I think of the amount of money I receive , I sometimes feel a little bit guilty .
Even though a lot of companies and people are struggling with the global economic downturn , we always receive high salaries .
We met at the restaurant and ate salad .
For dessert there was a surprise cake !
Skype is very useful , and we can make contact with people around the world without any charge , but it has some drawbacks .
It is that we must sit in front of our computers while we use skype , but I can use skype everywhere with my / an iPhone .
Deciding a date that is easy to remember is what 's important !
It sounds like `` thank you `` in English , does n't it ?
I went to the airport to see my wife ( and our baby inside her ) off yesterday .
Our plan in the past was that we would go back to Japan together around September .
However , she is pregnant , so it seemed to be better for her to go back there as early as possible ( at least in her mother 's opinion ) .
Then , I started a single life in the UK .
I found the below site .
I think non - licensed writers should be appreciated more .
Tomorrow , I am volunteering for a beach clean up .
in Kanagawa prefecture with my friend .
There was not a tsunami afterward today though ,
but now I became anxious about the possibility of a tsunami tomorrow .
The day before yesterday was an Indian festival .
Compared to Indian , I became a minority .
The temple 's look / structure is very majestic and spectacular .
Nevertheless , the next event was boring .
I spent 5 dollars to get the entrance ticket but I only stayed for about 30 mins .
This is because my friend wanted to leave .
I was kind of in bad mood .
If he had , we would n't have paid for it .
I thought it would be too tough for me to understand movies in English .
, so we followed his proposal .
Although he is a nice guy , he is supposed to cherish money and spent it in smart method .
I learnt the word ' ' submit ' '
I 'll use it in some examples .
I ( already ) submitted my resume to the company which I want to work for .
I 'll submit some documents to the embassy for getting a VISA .
I have to submit my homework to school .
I ( have ) got a cold . . .
- The size of his house gave me a shock .
- As far as I know , most Korean and Japanese people know what the `` general character of each blood type `` is and I think they take its significance seriously .
I do n't know if others , who are not korean or japanese , know it or not .
- I have heard about `` zodiac signs `` and I think it is similar to how `` the general character of each blood type `` works .
My sign is Leo and it says Leo people are brave and active .
I usually take these things just for fun , but sometimes they are really right about me .
I used to be surprised about this but now I think it is not that big a deal .
Well , it could be just because there is a coincidence .
Anyway , I enjoy cartoons on the general character of each blood type .
My blood type is B and it is described as `` B type people are optimistic but capricious . ``
And they tend to speak out .
It looks like a perfect match for the iPad .
You can insert the ipad horizontally into the slot while with the official apple ipad keyboard only can do it in vertical way !
And when you finish using , cover your ipad to the keyboard , it turns your ipad to an apple notepad immediately !
uhhh , I might be able to get it from some e - commerce websites here which imported it in an unofficial way , but I do n't want take risk because keyboards are just a fragile toy
I have a little question .
Are there some rules when I write `` Since `` or `` As `` on the beginning of a sentence ?
I registered on Lang - 8 today .

I have to report my assignment by Wednesday , but there 's something wrong with my computer .
I dont ' know how to solve it .
I tried in vain to solve it for about 2 days .
Although my major is Computer Science , I seem to be computer illiterate .
It wo n't be a problem , if the assignment is a personal task .
However , it must be done with a group .
Damn it ! Or : Dammit !
I 'm under stress .
Oh my god , today is very hot . In the morning , I want to school but sun is so hot . In the afternoon I must go swimming
Please do n't change all of the sentence into new sentences . . .
so the time was not checked .
We arrived at about 8 o ' clock .
about 10 clock , dynamo reached and 1 hour later , Insulting done . ( ? ? ? )
so we played with a cat , the factory pet , for about 3 hours .
There was no overtime work
On road of back to the home ,
But another thing was well
The fairway of the hole they were playing was next to the road .
When the first man began to swing , a hearse came along the road , he stopped and faced the funeral procession for a while , and when the hearse passed by , he bowed his head in prayer .
When they were walking to the green , the second man said , `` That was a touching show of respect for / to ( they both work ) the deceased / dead back there .
I had no idea / did n't realize ( again , both work well ) you were so sentimental . ``
The first man shrugged and said , `` it was the least I could do .

Though some people believe a considerable proportion of rural students would put great effort into learning , it is manifest that there really is a phenomenon that rural students are more prone to have difficulty entering university .
In my opinion , universities should render these students assistance given the reality of the differences between different areas .
Even though , I have to emphasize the fact that it is commonly believed today that rural students have been dispriviledged from their infancy onward .
I made friends
I played a lotwith my friends every day : )
Well . . .
Thatwas whatI picked up .
But nowwe are friends .
He could speak English , French and Arabic .
His friends couldspeak Japanese and some other languages .

Instead , he taught me English .
Also , I did not ( = did n't ) know that French is spoken in Arabia .
I 'm a little interested in French .
I want to make many friends from many differentcountries !
She will leave home and stay the whole day in kindergarten .

When I was a kid , I stayed at my grandpa and grandma 's house every month .
I always took a bath with my grandpa and slept next to him .
After bathing , he always took his tooth out of his mouth .
Of course , he had a full denture and I did n't .
I told my mother about this after I grew up , she laughed .
I 'm going to finish this dairy with a few words here before going to bed , to express my feelings about after watching the 10th Chinese Bridge competition .
At this moment , I know that nothing is impossible to manage when you engage in it with your whole heart and with your full effort . ( More natural English )

Today let me talk about a movie again . .
This video is from YouTube .

The woman in the video , whose name is Aum , is really popular in Thailand . Men love her because she looks sexy .
Today I made a cake with my family .
We ate it all .
I had a good Christmas day .
My sons received their presents from Santa .
I have a dream to work abroad as a Certified Public Accountant .
And today I went to a briefing session about a global working program at my company .
There I found out the requirements for going abroad are so hard and I ca n't meet the them .
At the same time , I got the TOEIC result which I took one month ago .
The score was lower than I had expected , so I am soooo shocked .
Anyway , I want to be a college student .
And If I am a college student , I will go abroad to study .
Where is it good to go to become skilled in English ?
He used to do the cooking ,
I decided to study Spanish yesterday although I 'm not good at Englisheither .
I heard that Spanish is descended from Latin like English .
If I study Spanish , studying English I will give me good results
I know ( / knew ) a man who can ( / could ) speak many other languages
and I have been reading articles on his blog .
so I ( have ) decided to study Spanish too .
I went to the library to borrow a Spanish book today .
and I chose `` Cafe Spanglish `` as my text book .
I will study Spanish for 30 minutes everyday ,
and I believe I can do it ! !
What is your 2nd Foreign language ! ?

GUNDAM ( RX78 - 2 )
The model was neat and was really big in size .
Actually , I watched this anime a lot of times when I was a child .
And , the model stood proud and tall on the grounds of my prefecture !
It was great !
What about you ? Do you know what is a GUNDAM ?
I enjoyed karaoke with my family today .
I do n't really know recent songs and I sang old song like 90 's .
What singers do you like in Japan ?
Today , I 'm writing about one of my favorite architects , Otto Wagner ( 1841 - 1918 ) , who was a famous architect and town planner in Vienna .
He was one of the great pioneers of the modern Viennese movement `` Secession `` .
To tell the truth , I went to Vienna for a school trip last summer and saw some of Otto Wagner 's buildings .
Especially , I liked the post office .
This post office , the Savings Bank , is one of the World Heritage sites in Vienna .
This building was designed with aluminium and glass .
In those days , these materials were rarely used .
That 's why Otto Wagner was called one of the great pioneers of modernist architecture .
Today is the final day in GW ( Golden Week ) which means long holidays .
I do n't wanna work anymore . . .
but I have to make a living . . .
This is encouraging for us . ( an encouragement )
We continue to practice for the next concert at the same place .
I was born and raised in Japan .
I study English by myself .
I work as a hair stylist and makeup artist .
I love this job .
My dream is to have my own shop .
That is why I want to study abroad .
People living near my house often give my family vegetables such as tomatoes and cucumbers in the summer .
So , I eat tomatoes day after day in summer .
people who give vegetables like planting them .
I think that the old people like planting vegetables better than the young people in Japan .
I 'm studying English and Chinese .
They are both difficult .
Visiting Kyoto
I had lived in Kyoto when I was a university student .
I went to Kyoto with my wife and son .
I live in Shiga next to Kyoto .
The trip took about thirty minutes by car .
I bought some items such as a pen case , a Post - it , etc . , with my son while my wife had Shiatsu , a kind of body massages in Japan .
I used a sling that helps carry my son .
It might seem to be Ikumen . We used that to mean a man who childcare hard in Japan recently .
Aside from working on the task my professor assigned to me , I 've been busy job - hunting on the Internet this week .
I have only attended two job interviews until now .
I did n't have any experience doing the tasks required of the position .
Well , I guess because it was a private company and one of the two interviewers was the CEO , so he asked whatever he wanted to know for it was HIS company .
Because he was writing things down , I did n't like it .
The general manager said a lot to me about her two overseas masters ' degree , her working attitude and high standard on candidates , and so on .
She said she was a workaholic who works 14 hours every day .
She was very proud that she worked 6 years in China , and then went abroad to work and got her degrees at the same time .
That was unimaginable .
She asked about my salary expectation and how I could think I worth that much money .
It was a tough question , especially when she asked it in an aggressive way .
She said my expectation could be reached after I work for 2 or 3 years and I have to work from the most basic position .
The problem was that my expected salary was the common standard in graduates .
At last , the sales manager told me to call her tomorrow if I decided to accept the job .
Since I go to a remote place I have not been before this is a good exercise .
It does not cost us a lot of money to go cycling .
I 'm a university student , and majoring in Japanese literature .
I especially learn about modern novels and Christian writers ' novels in Japan .
I 'm not good at anything at all , but please be kind to me .
But I have a lot of homework still .
I want to go to bed as early as possible ! !
Being a university student is very hard .
Study abroad is necessary to speak a foreign language skillfully ? ?
What do you think ? ?
The exam is held only once a year .
The year before last and last year I passed the first test but failed the second test .
I hope to pass the second test this year .
The results will be announced the end ( ? ) of this month .
What are you doing for New Years ?

Do you have any recommendations ?
What are you doing for New Years ?
I registered an account on this site today .
I decided on writing 3 times in a week .
However , my wife asked me to have lunch with her after my shopping .
I had no idea what to have for lunch with my wife during a weekday .
Everyday , I am working for a company , and my wife is maintaining our house .
Basically , it is impossible to have a lunch with her usually .
However , it was possible if I could take a half day off .
This idea has never occurred to me before .
We went to the wine shop first , and then we had a good lunch at an old Japanese restaurant .
By the way , I had to buy some wine today for my friend .
He invited me to the event .
Instead , I will give him some wine to express my thanks to him .
By the way , it will be holiday tomorrow ( is about to enter the morning of Tomorrow now . . . ) in Japan .
A place to live
I have some choices : staying in the dorm , finding a host family , or staying with friends .

Yesterday I made new friends at Lang - 8 and I got my first correction on my entry ~
Thank you for the corrections Turkuase .
Every Monday during this semester , I have only one class so I do n't feel like a burden during the weekends .
I could n't read my major books well and also could n't concentrate well .
I think I should n't hang out too much during the weekends or it will be hard for me to start a new week .
OMG , Tomorrow I have five classes , 3 of them are my major classes .
I had to clean my room before Chinese new year .
When I woke up and went to work ,

I was sure to watch his TV show and so on .
Since at that time , I respect him .
His first book is pursued good result .
I think that his ability and effort is enormous .
One day , I looked deep inside the bowl and I watched him for a while .
His mouth always moves .
Why do n't you get me a bigger tank with more fish in it ?
I put some plants in the bottom of the tank ,
So , I went to the pet store again and bought three more goldfish .
Happy to be here .
So , I often make food for my friends and parents .
Fortunately , one of my best friends really likes that I make choco - brownies .
And sometimes , when I want to make different cakes or pies , I usually surf the web .
Then , I can find a lot of recipe for that .
6 years ago , I ran her over with my car at an intersection in Shibuya , one of the biggest cities in Tokyo .
Fortunately , she only broke her hip joint and suffers from no after effect even now .
She was just about 2 - month - old alley cat then .
At that time , I was heading for the live house where my band had intended to give a rock concert that night . However , I could n't make it on time for our rehearsal .

Please call me Riye for short .
I am work for ABC company in Japan .
I have been working as a system planner in the IT devision for 1 year as of this June .
But before this position , I wasthe IT consultant for 5 years , so I am evry familiar with this company .
The recent trend at my company is : `` Our company will take the customer experience to the next level using digital technology . ``
For many years , since we 've been using information technology as a business tool , the company has put money into the cost - saving domain .
Finance , Purchasing , Sales Administration are the most important domains and have economic effects for / in IT investment .
But now is the time to use IT for developing a closed loop relationship between our stores and the customer .
We as system plannners must think to embrance social and digital media and continue to look for new ways to bridge the comfortable experience at stores with the digital world .
I would like to discuss with the central office members about my ideas detailed above .
This is one of the most important reasons why I want to study english .
Anyway I hope I can have a good relationship with you .
in a warm Spring light
I 'm writing a journal entry for today 's class , and I know there are some grammatical errors ,
but , I dont know how I 'm supposed to correct them .
First of all , asI am Japanese , I am glad to study this topic ; the nuclear bomb .
Throughout the roadback ( ? ) from Hiroshima , I found that thenuclear bomb generates nothing really , noteven sorrow , loneliness and sadness .
For instance , in the last part of `` A White Blouse `` , it says `` there was n't a single soul on the platform . `` It vividly creates an atmosphere of nothing , because the author says a single `` soul `` did not exist instead of sayinga single person
After that , it says `` but their hundreds of shoes , left and right separated one from the other `` Shoes , clogs , sandals and slippers represent the evidence that human lifewas there .
actually , this is my second writing daily ,
The first one was gone > < .
anyway I went to the mountain which is famous for rock climbing a week ago .
we are only a beginner so we used a ropeway from the starting place circa 700m to 1500 - ish m on one .
Then , we took the lift to go to the higher place !
The view was so nice
I was really satisfied and does n't want to continue further .
however we could n't go back so soon . Therefore , we continue climbing to the top of the mountain ! ! ! !
we are feeling happy at first , but the higher we reach I got difficulties in breathing > < .
I thought this was a sign of altitude sickness .
Finally , we arrived at the top ! ! !
It was amazing and awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! !
tomorrow , I am going to oze which is a national park .
I often correct some Korean and Japanese friends ' Chinese entries .
Because I am a little worried that they can not completely understand my suggestions in Chinese , and I ca n't speak Korean and Japanese .
Yesterday a friend of mine told me that I must submit a paper to get a scholarship of 2010 .
I was surprised because I have never heard that from the univ .
If I do n't not submit a paper , I can not receive scholarship . . . . .
In Japan , national universities have more money than private ones ; which differs from the ones in the USA .
( Tokyo has some major private ones : Waseda , Keiou , etc .
During the next two days , in Japan , National Center Test for University Admissions is held .
This is equivalent to the SAT in the USA .

My dream is traveling to many countries .
In Japan , the cherry blossoms begin to bloom ! !
I wish I had friends
I 've studied English for several years .
but I 've only focused on reading and listening .
for that reason I 'm not good at speaking and writing .
how can I improve my speaking and writing skills ?
Unfortunately I have no chance to talk in English .
I hope I can have some language exchange friends .
All second grade students in my school have been to Okinawa on a school trip for three days !
For example , we learned about the `` Battle of Okinawa ( April , 1945 ) `` , which happened during WWII , by visiting Okinawa .
We went to a bomb shelter and listened some stories from Okinawa people and visited the museum .
Girls around my age ( 13 - 18 years old students ) were forced to work as nurses for injured soldiers in lawless areas .
Most girls also died .
I think we have to remember such a sad story and do something for peace .
Of course , we also enjoyed playing in the `` summer resort `` of Okinawa for other two days ! ! ! ! ! !
We stayed at the hotel which was built near the East China Sea . I enjoyed seeing it , going for walks , having very delicious dinner and breakfast and talking with my friends until midnight !
I went to one of the most famous aquariums in the world , a beautiful sea park and the castle influenced by both China and Japan authorized as a world heritage building and so on .
It was very great fun ! ! ! !
. . . I do n't want to study for middle term exams which will begin next Friday : ' (
I enjoyed diving .
I bought them Coke of thanks .
I could have not post entries recently because I had a lot of things to do and the hard schedule made me have a headache .
Today , I have not got lots of things , so I can write and I 'm a little bit happy : D
Well , I am worried about the New Zealand Earthquake .
It struck seriously off the south of the land .
A newspaper also said that it was magnitude 7 .
Japan often has earthquakes , though I have never experienced such a horrible one .
I hope all of you have not been affected by this earthquake at all .
Japan has many earthquakes everywhere .
According to official information , Tokyo will be having a big earthquake
Recently I started to prepare evacuation equipment , food , towels , toiletries
Today I received water from a mail order company .
As it 's a big volume ( 30 cans ) ,

In my opinion , this site is really great to learn a second language .

I passed the test , oh yeah ! CONGRATULATIONS !
I will get my driver 's license after three weeks .
The answer to RAVI 's question of why we became temperamental in the meeting is because we are not local people here , we are highschool classmates , and went to different colleges in different cities far away from each other .
Finally we got together and ( now ) work in the same city , the most economically advanced city in mainland china , our hometown is 3 thousands miles from here , and it takes 4 hours by flight .
We have a meeting every two months because we are busy working usually .
On the other side , you know , asians are little conservative sometimes , they control their emotions , but if something sad were to happen , they go out of control , and become temperamental .
It 's ( both ) nomal and abnormal to you ,
I 've updated the Email System today , LOL , I 'll be busier tomorrow .
I have many things to say , but I 'm sleepy now , and it 's too late .
This is my first time using this site .
If you can find any mistakes in my diary , please indicate .

Nice to meet you everyone : )
I 'm Gayoung ,
But my foreign friends call me Riya .
I was given this name by my Indian friend : )
I 'm so happy to meet people from other countries and learn their customs .
The reason why I am learning English is to be able to travel and meet many people .

I 've spent much time alone today , because my wife went to her friend 's wedding party yesterday .
When I got up at 6 : 30 , I cleaned up the living room and ( one of the ) bed rooms .
I did two rounds of laundry , as there are many clothes which my wife and I wore in the basket .
Then I went to the hair salon to have my hair cut , so I could feel comfortable .
After she returns , we are going to have dinner together .
I took my baby to see my in - laws this morning .
I sometimes feel a little bit guilty about that .
Today I had no plans , and my baby wanted to go out , so finally I decided to visit them .
But , something bad happened after taking my baby to a park with my mother - in - law .
On the way back from the park to their house , my mother - in - law dropped by her neighbor 's and started yapping .
I know she really likes talking , and she was really happy to show her grandkid to her neighbors .
At last , I got tired of waiting for her to finish talking .
She prefers being alone to associating with neighbors .
So , that was a shock !
I think people had better not drink too much like in this picture .
Today I went to my university , and attended the German class .
After studying , I had a meeting for the shodo club .

I did n't write a diary for long , long time . . .
Maybe for around 1year !
Anyway , I went to India and I was staying there from December 2010 to March 2011 .
To be honest , around 4 years ago , when I sufferedvsome kind of untreatable disease , I thought that I never go to India again .
Because that disease attacks the stomach .
And there was many difficult situations for me .
I really felt sad and hopeless .
But during several years , I could n't give up on that .
But India has strong , attractive people and is a place with many experiences and views .
And also , India always gives me a strong vitality .
That is why I could n't give up on that .
I really appreciate that .
February is a graduation season .
Also , they strip the graduates and throw them into the sea .
As I see it , this is embarrassing .
I am poor ,
but I want to fulfill my sexual desires .
What should I do to satisfy these contradictory two things ?
I may lose my life .
I wonder if I should take the risk .
trip ( Vietnam , Guam )
Do you all go on trips frequently ?
I often go on trips .
I have been to Vietnam and Guam as far as foreign countries .
I went to the gulf of the world heritage in Hanon , Vietnam .
It was mysterious and I was impressed .
Though I wanted to go swim in the clean sea ; I could n't , so I was very sad .
However , I went diving , and I was impressed by the beautiful fish .
They were both splendid places .
I recommend these places for vacations .

But I could not hear it .
I will listen to it when I go home .

beauty school and she always tells me about cosmetics , hair , and so on .
I went to the beauty salon at my friend 's school .
I got her to give me a shampoo and a blow - dry ! !
I also got her to do my make up ! !
My friend told me that cosmetics were so cheap in Korea ! !
So now I want to go there and buy a lot of brand name goods ,
for example , MAC , Lunasol , RMK , and so on .
Although I live alone , whenever I open the vacuum bag after a period of time , I ( always ) see so much dust inside .
I wonder where all this dust comes from ?
There is something wrong with my PC
My PC does not boot correctly for some time now .
I usually push the reset button each time when I boot my PC .
Today , the sounds connecting the PC to another device ring suddenly .
I became afraid immediately .
Does my machine contain any computer virus ?
Or simply the hard disc might have been broken ?
Actually , it is the first time for me to install it on my PC .
I have been using this PC since 2004 .
My heart is pounding .
A financial crisis is coming . As a Chinese , I have an opportunity as well as a challenge . In my opinion our country has the chance to improve its national strength . However , we also have the stress on our economy .
She was a magical girl .
She is gone .
She was killed by witch who 's named `` Charlotte `` .
She fought to guard her friends , but Charlotte was very strong .
Initially , I thought that she was a wire - puller .
But I was mistaken .
She was not a wire - puller .
Many people were sad about her death .
If a wire - puller does exist , it is for good those who wrote this stupid scenario , and us who hoped for this stupid scenario .
God speed Mami .

Hello ~ ~ Everybody ! ! I 'm a newcomer in lang8 .
Living in Seoul for 23 years .
currently serving in Gunsan 38th fighter 's Wing as an first class airmen .
very interesting in learning how to speak fluently and write proper in English .
My recent hobby is painting .
I like painting pictures .
The day before , I bought some drawing paper , painting brushes and water - color paint .
When I paint a picture , I can focus and devote myself wholesomely into painting the picture .
My husband 's friend sent us a ( box of ? ) cream cheese and strawberry cake .
It was from the famous cake shop in Hokkaido , which is located in the north part of Japan .
The shop is famous for cheese cakes .
They occasionally run temporary shops in the department stores in Tokyo , but we ca n't usually buy it in Tokyo .
That 's why it is valuable . However , my daughters do n't like cakes and my husband does n't like cakes with a strawberry flavor .
We took the lesson this morning .
It was a two - story cake .
One was a cream cheese layer which was heavy , and the other was a strawberry layer which was sweet and sour .
Studying is hard when you have to force yourself .
When you hate doing something , you just stop doing it .
That 's why you have to organize your work so it will be comfortable for you .
I have tried many ways to study English .
I have read textbooks , which was useful but boring .
I have learned unknown words from a dictionary , which was dull .
I then tried some more things until I realized that I like reading books the most .
I learn them and then throw the sheet away .
If I forget a word , I write it down and learn it again .
I think too much information does n't help .
I went out driving with my sister today ,
I decided to make a necklace using power stones .
I used some stones which have a healing power .
The dessert I had was so good ! !
I think the bread and milk in the UK might be more delicious than those in Japan .
So , France is probably a very nice country in terms of bread .
Today , I my girl friend and I broke up .
It 's because she has an important dream .
It is hard for her because she has to earn a lot of money and has to study harder and harder .
we talked about these dreams with each other .
We agreed it 's best for us to break up and concentrate on our dreams .
So we decided to part from each other .
Before get to the train , I am not sad because I can not really believe it .
After get back home , I am so sad because I notice she does n't call , send E - mail , talk by skype anymore .
I hesitate whether dispose of her present to me , a key holder , or not .
Now I can websurf with this phone which is what I 've wanted the most .
But I 'm not accustomed to yet , so I only know a few functions .
Something that I feel uncomfortable with is writing Japanese .
I found an application that makes it possible , but even so , writing Japanese is still not easy .
I can not make corrections through the phone but I can leave a comment .
I caught a cold and have a runny nose .
Because it was raining so hard there wassome trouble getting to the sepulcher .
The rain stopped but it 's still so chilly here .
Now I have to go visit my uncles .
Tomorrow is a holiday ! !
But when tommorrow is gone , I 'm gon na start a hard schedule !
Do n't give up ! !
Re - starting Yoga
Last year , I used to do yoga every morning and every night for about three months .
I hae a yoga video ( ? ) file on my laptop .
This video ( or : It ) takes about 45 minutes .
After finishing it , you will be sweating ( ? ) all over and feel refreshed .
I really want to get back to the shape I used to be in just half a year ago .
These few weeks have been hell , really !
I was punished by my ever so strong inclination to procrastinate and procrastinate .
So the essays and books to read piled up until I had a to - do pile of paperwork the size of a skyscraper ^ ^ ; The result was me reading books the night before my literature oral exam , hehe ^ ^ ;
So I stocked up on some chocolate and other stuff you wo n't know how many calories they contain .
In times of despair , energy drinks come to my rescue .
I get hyper by the smell alone !
XD Yummy , never thought sugar with 6 drops of water mixed with other complicatedly - named things could be quite tasty !
Vindottir , our four - footed cesspool , is the cause of this stench .
Unfortunately , her farts are silent , but deadly ones .
My nose hairs almost got scorched by smelling that !
My mother kicked her into the garden , because the little fella transformed into a mustard gas factory which we could no longer stand .
Iiiek , Vindottir feasted on those tasty pellets , since a little , wild rabbit is happily hopping on our grass field .
Fortunately , the pellets have worn off , so we can breathe again , phew !
Our baseball team is unskilled and has no vitality .
Every game , we lose !
I am thinking of changing positions between pitcher and fielder .
Japanese people make this doll to be sunny day .

I had heard so much about this place so I wanted to come here .
Actually , Bournemouth is not a big city , but I like this kind of city .
While I 'm here , I can feel fresh air everyday . Furthermore , people have been kind and helpful to me whenever I 've gotten lost .
Last night , I came back from the USA .
I went to Vermont , New York City , Disneyworld and so on ! !
