The first, most women have baby and they have to take maternity leave
Employers don't like it even if maternity leave is the right for employees
The second,  women workers likely to quit their job because of child care or the transfar of ther husbands
If a woman worker quit her job, employers have to find a new employee
Though there are many women workers who have excellent potentil, employers often hesitate to hire them

2 months later, I am going to back to Korea
I just learnt alphabet
It’s said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japanese’s, so that the Korean who study Japanese just have to take about 1year to speak Japanese fluently, while the other foreigners have to take 3,4 years or more than so 
I found that the Korean’s alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese’s
How about the way of spell
And after I entered the Japanese department, I even can’t recall any English’s grammars that I’d learnt before
But it’s also said that it’s very difficult to learn well both of them
One time, I had an Japanese examination
The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before when see a katakana word, we just try to think of an English word and then spell it
I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reasons
Then I asked my brother for an advice, he said that “I like Japanese
I was acquainted with him in a Chinese’s room chat when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago
He is very special person, even though we’ve met in real life yet
He is 8 years older than me but he just likes a friend
He is very humorious and handsome 
He can always make me smile even when I’m in bad mood
But in my university, at the second year of regular training, we can choose a second qualifications if we want and sure that we’ll be able to study well both
My university has about 11 foreign language’s departments and some other department where teach economics, travel bussiness, computer and so on… If we’re learning a foreign language, we’re advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness’s department so that when we graduate we will have a best job
So next year, I intend to choose English department for the second qualifications
And when we’re at the third year, we have a compulsory subject
It’s differ from the second qualifications
Because the second qualifications  also has economics, travel bussiness, computer… training and it isn’t compulsory
For example, I’m learning Japanese, I have to choose one in 10 other foreign languages remained
So, if next year I choose the English department, the year after I maybe choose Korean for second foreign language
To learn almost Japanese, we have 4 years
After that, it’s not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently
It’s called “love’s language”, isn’t it
Do you know our Uncle Ho who was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages
I can’t do like that but I wish I could learn at least 4: Japanese, English, Korean and French
Do I have the ability to do
I’m very worry about it
This time  we still have to test 4 Japanese’s skill
I’m very nervous of speaking and listening skill
It was so bad, wasn’t it?And the essay’s topic this time will be random
I’ll have to write anything in Japanese as topic’s request
And life is short

There is a big difference between the east and the west, when comes to education,i always admired how the westerner educate their posterity,their method is so gentle and kind,full of love and meaning,whereas the asian method is rather more of violence,for example the chinese people believe that a child should be educated with rods
countless beating from their parent is believe to be capable of forging a successful child!thats how i was brought up at least, my parent always tell me how much they love me although they served me with rod every time i commit a wrongdoing,however when comes to the western way of parenting,it sounds like a fairy tale to me,for example the western parent always said this to their child if they happened to be repudiate, the parent will say this\" go to your room!\" this is something that will never happen in an asian family
May be our parent would never realize the trauma they had inflicted on us

however they are unsuccessful because most of their disarmament  were not achieve
the greatest achievement of the league is the social issue no organization had ever do it before ,until now their war has been taken over by the U
N so it is a great success,however it fail to stop powerful countries starting a war,fail to establish disarmament,also fail to defend the treaty of Versailles ,these give rise to aggression by axis power
