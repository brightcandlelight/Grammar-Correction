I talked about my memories about the sports day , my dream and
However , we have to go to school by the time we know the result of the exam ,
Today I 've got enrolled to this website .
I 'd like to be better at English but it 's difficult for me to make sentences in English because of its collocation .
So I 'm happy if you correct my diary .
If you 're trying to learn Japanese , then I 'll correct your one .
My girl friend and I are contemplating marriage .
We plan to register our marriage on April 1st , April Fool 's Day , because the day is very remindful .
As they heartly congratulated us hearing our news , I was very relieved .
It 's cold today too . . .
But I do n't think so too .
If you have n't ever been to here , please come here for summer season : ) haha
From today , I start to write diary in English .
By writing diary in English , I aim to make my English skills better and to become be able to make communication with abroad people .
By making the daily events into text , I also aime to review each day and make next day better .
I will try it every night .
The first target is to continue to write diary in one month .
yesterday I went to cairo to play chess match and I won

This picture is when I learn flying .
Even do you like flying in the sky ?
How to fall asleep soon
If you start to exercise and really tire out your body , you will be nice and exhausted when it comes time to go to bed .
When I began running expecially longer distances ( it took me awhile to build up to that , though ) , I would go to bed and welcome the sweet release of sleep .
In order to run , I began waking early , using this tips in the article you read .
They worked , and the flip side of the equation is that I became so tired at night that after awhile , I just could not stay up late any more .
If you begin waking up early , you might be tired for a few days , and eventually you will be forced either to go to sleep earlier or wake up later .
It 's easy - - - - I 've done it a lot .
But if you turn those things off and go to bed , and read in bed , you will probably fall asleep , if you 're really tired , from those two tips I gave above .
Exercise and wake up early , and then go to bed and read .
My PC had been broken .
I sent it to service center .
Yes , I am writting this diary with a brand new PC !

My teacher is a amusing guy , and he asked turk to taugh us turkish , and asked me to taugh them chinese .

My chinese cliant will sale the pollack to Chinese market .

A very interesting thing is that most members drive the same brand car of a series of styles except year .
The car type and generation are different .

I went to see Transformers Dark of the Moon in 3D in the morning .
I 've seen Transformers 's series and I was also looking forward to seeing it .
The movie adopts in 3D format made by 3D cameras for the first time .
Thus effects in 3D format was awesome and very naturally .
Battle scenes have powerful and I was very exciting .
I thought that the movie showed the most effective in 3D format that I had seen .
I saw the movie of caption version .
If I perfectly understand conversations of English on the movie , I would not read captions .
But I need read captions haha .
3D format made my eyes tired , especially reading captions .
I wish that I enjoy seeing the movie without Japanese captions .
School life in Paris
it 's been so good so far .
People do n't speak any Asian languages here of course , which is good for me because I speak English primarily and French secondarily here .
I think I 've forgotten a lot of Japanese words .
yeah I 'm doing well on it haha .
Is it part of the culture or personal problem ?
But anyway , I still have a lot of improvement to make in English .
I can deal with normal conversations but when it comes to business English , it turns out to be so difficult which I think is the same thing in any languages .
We have Chinese characters , Romaji which is the same thing that English speaking people use , Katakana is mostly used to describe foreign words and Hiragana which is a Japanese phonetic language .
I want to learn more languages like Spanish , Portuguese etc .
She added that this purpose is to protect the health of the smoker .
And two women in her early twenties are included .
The smoker is about 10 % in our office .
And then the `` no - smoking `` became common in our field .

All the bueatiful things did depressed me .
In fact , I am currently study the English department in college , but I want to have more chances to practice my English .
I have some problem about spelling the right words , I usually forget how to spell or lose some letters while spelling .

Oh by the way , I got some problem in grammar about the words `` hope and if `` .
Green Green
I dropped in the laundry first and started to walk around .
Do they really help us to cut our energy use ?
As I wrote in my diary , the radio was on all day in my office and I heard on the radio that growing green curtains is one of the way of energy conservation .
The following was I learned about the green curtains on the radio .
Green curtains prevent the sunlight from coming directly in rooms during daytime , that makes you set your air - condition 's temperature low .
Since its about business , you ca n't rely on things that is risky .
First diary
I wash the clothes and clean the room in all day .
I glad the salary day until 2 days .
I 'm going to go to UK tomorrow !

I have n't seen one for a long time , was happy .
I start to write in my diary .
Since I decided to go to the bed early .
I finished two task for now .
I 'm taking a break to listen to music and drinking a cup of coffee .
Who do you like in singers ?
Hawaii has many places to see , eat , and swim .
I am excited to go there .
What place do you recommend ?
I went to my friend 's hous .
I got on the train from neaby subway station to end of the line , and walked to friend 's house .
I had n't a umbrella .
I decided to run to there , but rain was getting strong .
It 's rainy season in Japan now , but it is n't raining thesedays , so I ca n't bring umbrella .
Because I love to eat Japanese .
I like spicy food such as Kimuch that is Kolean food .
It contains a lot of red chile .
It effects for excitometabolic .
Of course , I even like to eat fast food such as Mcdonald .
The reason why it 's save time and money !
I have managed a homepage as one of my hobbies .
About 40 - 100 people visit my website everyday .
Whenever someone clicks this advertisements article , Google gives me
The advertisements content is automatically related to the contents of my
Now , around 5 people clicks
It seems that I can get 100yen per day ( \ 3000 / M , \ 36000 / Y )
But , I have n't enjoyed that so far .
I was extremely busy this week because there were a trouble in my job .
It would run over one year in two weeks later , however the software trouble has found last week .
So I had to work fixing bugs for free even though the software did n't make by me .
This is because people who made it quit our company last month .
Otherwise if it will occur 2 weeks later I can earn some money .
What a bad timing !

`` I had you wait . ``
thanks for reading this entry , you all will have a great day ! !
Could you tell me how to use them using sentence .
In Japan , sad incident ocuured .
Shinsuke Shimada who is very popular TV personality withdrew from the world of entertainment because it is found out that he had relation to Japanese mafia in the past .
I like him because his talk is very light and very interesting .
His talk attracts people minds .
I am very sad thinking that I never see him on TV .
This is first Writing English
This is my first wrote English diary , and not good .
But I still want to write , maybe can take good experiance .
This is my hope in a university sophomore .
Today I want to continue the yesterday entry , by writing a little bit about the requirement that I should respect in order to enter the university in Denmark .
So , this will be the first big difficulty , because I estimate that my English level right now is around the B2 / C1 european standard level , while I should reach in 1 year , in order to pass the Toefl with excellent scores , a C2 level .
I will finish high school in June 2013 , but if I want to apply for a Danish university I need to present my application by March 2013 , so I do n't know if they already require the certification that I wo n't have until June .
I do n't want an entire year waiting to enter the university in 2014 , so next year I 'll try to contact the university to have some information .
But I 'll have to learn Danish to go to the Grocery store or places like that , I guess .
I 'll se in the future . . . .
I have 1 year still to decide on what to do , even tough I 'm pretty sure about Denmark .
I will watch movie .
I will eat at restrant in the department store .
and I am only in the home .
Do you interest to Android ?
And study hard .
Android is a lot of talk in Japan recently .
But , Almost of the information is english .
English is necessary to make the good Android application .
This is a reason that I study English .
In this country there are bunch of racist .
I understand some people say some racist comments to me because they and I are friends .
However , still I like here .
I wish I can speak fluently in English and make friends with them as American people do each other .
Yesterday and the day before yesterday I worked a part time job .
I ca n't tell the contents of the work , but it was really effortless .
Incidentally , I enroll in temporary employ agency .
The work of yesterday and the day before yesterday was that agency ' job .
It 's an hourly wage of $ 10 .
And I went out for dinner with my best friend last night .
After eating , we stopped at book store near the restaurant .
And I encountered my high scool 's friend .
He also is interested in studying abroad , so we talked for some time .
I have only a few friends who understand my mind of studying abroad .
I have a realization of importance of my friends now .
It opens monthly first Sunday , this is the first time for me to visit there .
A mount of people and a flood of goods are there .
nice to meet you !
I 'm studying English , especially writing and speaking .
Today 's my plan
I 'm going to lunch and Karaoke with my friend .
But first , I will going to starbacks .
I like that going to a coffee shop in the morning .
I read book , write a dialy and sutdy in English at there .
Do you have your favorite place ?
Foreigner can understand only words .
It is a place that sees Tokyo Tower there and is very beautiful .
It went to Roppongi after it had counted down .
Do you know Charo ?
It is broudcasting by NHK radio and TV of English course .
There are a small path named `` Omoide - Yokocho `` in the western side of Shinjuku Station .
The path and bars have Showa Retro Style , it looks like it is not changed for long time from Showa era .
It was my first visit to the path .
We enjoyed drinking some beer and other drinks and yakitoris with very reasonable price .
I had watched Hakone Ekiden , which is the most famous long - distance race in Japan , on TV for 2 days from January 2 .
I have always watched this race without missing every year since I was an elementary student .
I attract this race .
First , this race has long history .
This race has done every year for 85 years .
That is , this race keeps doing for 85 years .
This race is done by University students located in Kanto region .
For instance , the students has much efforts to participate in this race .
Some runnner gives up without competing by extremery dehydration and low blood sugar .
Yes , this race is severely because almost runnners run about 20 km .
Especially , this race separates 10 sections between Otemachi , Tokyo and Hakone ( 5 sections for one way ) , runnners must run 850 meter difference above sea level on 5th section .
That 's why nobody knows what happens .
And the reason why I am the most attract is that the runnner 's imposing figures encourages me to feel more hold out whatever may happen .
I could get a lot of impression and courage .
It 's been a long time to visit here since I wrote a diary about my ex - girl friend 's wedding .
I just came here for looking around what 's new here , not for writing .
but when I read the diary abou my ex - girl friend , I decide to update my diary .
becuase I fell in love with a woman .
I met her girl 5 month ago at work .
She was just my co - worker .
I started my job last year but there are lots of reason that I 'm thinking of it .
I intended to go to a graduate school after graduating university .
The company that I 'm working for is little bit strange , for example even we overworked we ca n't get paid . . . .
there are a lots .
Griping and complaining do n't change situation and anyway I need to work before going back to school saving tuition fee .
So I thought that to change a job is one of choices .
One of my friends have already taken a job interviews and he told me that what he was asked .
There was a question what made him really embarrassed , that 's ' ' What is your strength area ? ? ' '
I think we know what we like or what we interested in , but if someone ask me ' ' what is you strength area ? ? ' '
I 'm not sure if I can answer soon or not .
I was bought up in Busan .
I really love to learn foreign language and I also love travel to meet around world people .
Ju - hee ( interviewee ) : I 'm good at consulting with unique people and meeting .
Also I have a leadership and strong mind .
So , I have developed myself through the activity of group in our school I 'll do best .
Ju - hee ( interviewee ) : I think about a flight attendant should be positive , responsible , and adaptable in ant situation because they and meet various international people in many different situations .
And , they should treat them equally and spontaneously .
Also they should realize their actions quickly and calmly and them , try to control any problems .
I think passengers could be releived by this behavior , and professional performance .
Please sign up here .
I post the papers later .
I will never forget that my dancing teacher have asked me a question when I was 17 years old .
I have joined dance club when I was a senior student , but it was very difficult for a new learner , no matter poses or tempos , I 'm such as a dork . . .
My teacher have asked me : `` Why are you come here ?
I do n't reply anymore to him , bacause I know that he just reminded me should be serious for dancing , do n't care views of someone .
Learning dancing for 4 years , hopefully one day , people will ask me : `` Are you a teacher ?
`` , not `` Are you a dancer ?
`` anymore .
Once I have danced in nightclub , a teacher who is teaching ballroom dancing , he have asked me : `` Why are you want to learn dancing ?
Become a teacher in the future ?
I 'll keep to learn dancing until forever .
I find that it 's easier to say something I feel embarrassed in English than in Mandarin .
The above is nothing to do with this journal I am going to say .
The thing I want to say is I think I should stop hide my feeling .
I am absolutely a honest woman ; however , my nature is to hide my own feeling .
Also he is very smart and good at archtecture and history .
I really like to go to his class ; however , I always keep silent because I am afraid he will criticize about what I say .
And I am going to stay in Hsinchu so that I am afraid that I wo n't meet such an excellent teacher .
And then I told him I talk to my parents everyday too but I seldom tell them what I did .
3 ) I am straight but I feel more comfortable to talk to woman .
And I feel it 's easier for me to make friends with woman .
I am that kind of person who will pretend to be careless when I meet the guy I like .
Today is my friends birthday .
So I wanted to send E - mail to say Happy Birthday , at just 12 : 00 .
But I was so tired yesterday that I cant send it

I study alone until 15 : 00 , then Kattuchan who is my boyfriend came . He and I studied together till 22 : 00 . We were talking a little . I was happy .
But , I m tired . . . > <
Spank or not to spank ?
We can speak to them and teach what is wrong and what is right and in the long term that will be more effective than hittng .
I totally agree with it .
And that 's what a good society is , which can embrace minority .
I agree with it .
Trouble is kink of trandmark of children .
Children is not children anymore if they know how to behave and never make mistakes , I think .
It 's natural parents face all kinds of trouble when raising their children so it 's nice if parents can understand and enjoy the trouble that children make .
What Do You Think About Learning Other Languages ?
Do you think mastering other languages relate to learners ' age ?
I 'm sure that people can master other languages without relating their age .
However , it takes a little bit long time to master other languages , compared to young people .
I think that the most important thing to master other languages is to maintain motivation with high level .
Because we ca n't handle other language like native speakers quickly .
However , it is very valuable for us to take our whole life to master other languages .
I 've remembered that how my daughter had learned Japanese .
When she was a baby , I always tried to speak her with simple Japanese phrases , and she had watched Japanese TV shows for kids every day .
I also read her a bunch of books in Japanese .
That means she had grown up with Japanese language circumstances .
Therefore , If I could do as if babies learned their mother tongues , I would be able to master English .
I 've heard about that human beings use only 10 percent of brains .
We do n't use ninety percent what is left of our brains .
I think it is really waste not to use whole of brains .
I 'm sure that we can have extra room to remember other language into our brains .
I want to believe that I can master English from now on , if I would n't chose wrong way to learn English .
I would love to maintain highly motivation ; I also want to put myself into circumstances where I must use English .
I have to go to univercity now .
goodbye .
So I 've not go to snowboardingyet .
I wonder if I going to go to snowboarding next week .
Is American english pronunciation diffirent from British English one ?
I do n't know weather English speakers know there are 4 kinds of English pronunciations in toeic test .
Certainly I can barely perceive those differences , ut for me it 's trifling .
At the same time , I wonder how native speakers feel and consider those differences .
I sometimes hear British is proud of their ORIGINAL ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION , and some English claim American English pronunciation is NOT formal .
By the way , I have been studing American English ( I mean , I use CNN in spite of BBC as leaning materials and so forth ) So I am used to hear American English .
I often feel they both are the same .
I found this movie trailer out on Apple trailers site .
`` The Scientist `` is interesting to me as long as I saw its trailer .
Woman : So , What do you think happens you die ?

We went to have Japanese bbq food in Causeway Bay .
Athough we always have dinner with her , but I am first time to invite her in formal .
This is very special for us .
Let me to share some photos to you .
We teach each other to be humble .
We have to be humble , even if you are told to be so , when we recognize a fact that we have bad point , and little power .
Long time no see .
I 'm a student at university of Ritsumeikan in Japan .
I 've studied English for since junior high school student .
The reason why I learn English is to go to study abroad .

So , I 'd like to try to eat a variety of seafood dishes all over the world .
My friend , Min came from Thai 3 years ago .
She and I have been made a friends this Apr at the cooking school .
Sometimes she teaches me Thai , but I would see the words look like all same .

I should make a careful preparation for the coming day .
I 'm very nervous , and curious .
When I arrive in Kyoto , I saw a lot of modern buildings .
I thought `` Where are old temples ? ? ? ``
`` This city is not so different from my town . . . ``
But walking around the city , I found there are many temples and shrines there .
I thought I wanted to live there , and I could take a lot of pics .
Today I loged in to check if I have got any message .
Later I helpt two friens to correct their Chinese writing .
I hope we all can take participation in this activity and share happiness or sorrow with others .
The movie is Fast & Furious 4 .

This morning I scared of being called to the board for an oral test , but no teachers did .
yesterday I bought a new cellphone .
htc hero .
I think it 's just good pr .
why do you love your iphone ?
This week was so hard time for me .

I want to introduce myself but do n't know what to say .
He thought I was modest .
But actually I am try to be honest .
Now I am read some books about Psychology .

From Hokkaido for Okinawa are bad wether .
japanese call ` Akisame Zensen ` . . . .
I braked my car as hard as I could , and I was narrowly able to avoid running him over .
He must have had something wrong with his brain , probably because of old age .
It look nice weather today .
To do list
* Doing experiment ( changing the mediume )
* Making papers with power point about diabetes especially insulin effect mechanism
I did ' nt time to eat , as I woke up late .
Anyway I still wonder my english will be better .
We went to shopping .
That is so cute !
It is small and to get there , we travel 30 minutes by boat .
There are many beaches , where the people go for a swim , walk or surf .
There are many surfers in the sea beacuse there are good waves .
It is very relaxing and al places are very clean .
On the coast have many restaurant with different sytles .
You can see fantastic things in this island !
I went to friend 's house getting on the subway .
The subway in New York was complex .
However , it became a good experience .
At that time , Canada also went by the day trip .
I ran about 4000 miles by car .
I want also to visit the USA .
It plans New York from Las Vegas .
A Japanese guy in London .
Though I 've been here six months , I still have questions which is not quite clear to me .
I think it 's not exaggeration to say Japanese service businesses have highest qualities in the world .
Trains and busses in Tokyo hardly ever abort its service on the way .
Trains run every 2 minutes following timetable and if train is late for more than 5 minuites , we can get refund .
I have n't taken a shower with cold water because showers have n't broken and if it 's broken repairman comes and fixes it on the day .
There are chain restaurant whose plices of foods are n't so different from those of Macdonalds .
We can cancel contracts of mobiles through the internet 24 hours .
We can reserve the day we cancel contracts of mobiles .
Thus , all Japanese people have to adapt themselves to inconvenience .
Plus , London 's service which is way behind the times is common subject for us .
Why London is inconvenient , though it is in advanced country and is a economic capital of the world ?
I found an interesting website about some common writing mistakes of English grammar that native speakers make frequently .
It 's obvious that those words are very close in both pronunciation and meaning to each other and that this makes it hard for native speakers to tell them apart when it comes to writing .
If anything , common mistakes Japanese people would make would be about articles , countable nouns , and tense .
I received my office test with co - workers today .
It is important for me , the test is for my promotion in the office .
The passing line is 60 points .
I 'm so tired due to the test , and go to bed !
How was your today ?
To me , I 'm not good .
Because there are many people who speak English very well in my English academy .
Free club is free of charge class for students .
In today 's free club , we discussed about Honduras 's problem .
we made groups of 4guys each group , and talk about it .
But me and a girl hardly never speaking .
After that time , I have a diffidence .
As if my big confidence become tiny bean .
Can you give me a consolation ?
Shizuoka is popular with Mount Fuji ( Fujisan ) and Green tea .
I used to look out it during a boring class .
Green tea is the one of the famous Japanese Drink in the world , I think .
Shizuoka is the highest prefecture of consumption of green tea in japan .
We , Shizuoka people , drink green tea every after lunch .
Unfortunately , Shizuoka is not one for sightseeing like Kyoto or Tokyo .
However it 's the one of the best place to live in Japan .
We can get to Tokyo or Nagoya within an hour by express train ( Shinkansen ) .
Almost all People are kind .
I 've started Twitter .
I 'm not sure about how to play it yet very much .
Also on Twitter , I 'll tweet only in English to improve a language skill .
Does anyone register it ?
I yearn after them , because they have brond hair , and blue or brown eyes , and high noses , and they are very good style .
I think they are very nice sense .
I want to be good at speak English , because I talk with them and become friendly with them .
However , I can not study to talk or hear .
Where should go to meet with them here ?
It seems 2days are warm and fine .
This image is as you see rough drawing .
I ca n't remember it is the one used which working .
Animator draw not only the person , but also smoke and other natural phenomenon .
Almost animator do n't like draw natural phenomenon .
there is a person who like draw natural phenomenon .
They are called `` effect animator `` in Japan .
The bride is so beautiful and I wish I would be nice like this one day .
Well , just hope .
There is the park between the nearest station and the hospital he is in .
It was raining heavily , and I was listing to music in full volume .
While I was walking through the park , somehow my wallet fell off from my pocket .
When I realized , I was in a cold sweat .
There were some cash cards , credit cards , my driver licence , and other stuff in my wallet !
But my wallet was taken to the police box by a kind gentlemen !
Somehow the police officer knew it .
In order to practice English , I think I should better using both English and Japanese in my blog .
Although I do not think that there will be many people visiting my blog .
I have spent all my will of language learning Japanese .
But , now I am the fourth grade in college , I want to find some work after I graduate .
Comparing English and Japanese , I like Japanese better than English .
Okay , I am going to listening English drama first , starting from `` Frisnds `` .
But I don ` t waiting only .
I always try to make a action of strike it rich in my life .
This is my first writing
I went to Bath in the UK last weekend .
Bath seems to be used as the root of `` bath `` .
Actually , there is an old hot spring bath made by ancient Roman in Bath .
I wanted to take the old bath , but it was not possible because it is to be protected as a heritage .
There were Christmas market also in Bath .
Christmas market seems to be a culture from European continent .
There were many small shops in open space near big church .
I ate Yosenabe , and I am full and sleepy .
First , the change of the attitudes to the Constitution allowed Douglass to take part in politics .
Garrisonians took nonvoting policy because they thought politics in the United States was already corrupt and to participate in it degraded themselves .
The Constitution is a basis of politics in this country ; therefore there was no way for Douglass to get involved in it as long as he denied the Constitution .
Although his speeches and writings which he made during Garrisonian days impressed a lot of people , it did not give any pragmatic power for Douglass to abolish slavery .
On the other hand , in politics , once you could appeal to a numbers of voters , you could actually change the society through elections and realizing policies in the Congress .
The town is very small , but is known for its traditional cityscape , where I could see beautiful antique gass lamps standing along stone streets and some buildings , which has been built about 100 years before .
What 's more , I could feel the great nature because the town was being surrounded by mountains , which were beginning to turn red and yellow .
There , I bought a grilled squid , some fried chickens and potatos , a stick of banana with the chocolate , two candy apples and a candy grape , four Taiyakis and an Okonomiyaki .
It was good to watch some traditional dances , which was played by students of the school of the town , with these foods .
I enjoyed so much of foods and the nature , and the festivitiy of the small town .
yesterday 's diary
yesterday I readed an article from company mail .
I find that it 's easy to read the article but I ca n't write it .
I some days do n't login Lang - 8 .
I like to read peaple write article .
I like English , I like japanese .
but I perfer the chinese .
Now a days , We can exchange fireworks with some items at street stalls .
My friends get them and use fireworks .
By the way , you know we have Fukushima problem in Japan .
That problem is very big and continued , so there is an self - control atmosphere now .
Many fireworks festivals are canceled this year .
If grilled chickens smell good , what may I say ?
The chicken is savory or fragrant ?
Today , we have an English class .
Miss Gan sent us a tast paper about translation .
But we did badly .
Firstly , our vocabulary is poor .
We can not use the exact words to express ourselves . what 's more , most ofthe grammer we learnt in high school have been forgetten .
So our English become more and more poor .
I can only use the simple words .
That 's too terrible
I writing but I talk is my problem , my friends are japanese , have a great christmas . javi
Today , In the morning I went to work and then in the evening I went to drinking with my friend .
It 's been a long while since I drunk , so soon I got a drunk .
I 'm likely fall asleep .
Tomorrow I have to work from 10 to 23 , so I 'll go to bed now .
It has been a long time since last time I visited this website .
I hope that I can improve my english writing skill by keeping a journal here .
I belong to Unbalance which is one of the club in my college .
It is a club to play many sports such as volleyball , badminton , futsal , basketball and so on .
The club act on Friday once a week .
We made some teams and each of the teams fought .
As a result my team lost , but we can enjoyed the game .
Though many people say Unbalance is funny name , I like this club !
And this website have asked me if I made it or not every day .
I just want to write something .
But I think that forging the habit is more important than writing long stuff sometimes .
( This is NOT my excuse for my not posting for the past about ten days . . . ) I thought I would write some sentences like I 've been doing but I noticed that I 'd already written enough .
OK , I make it a rule to write something down everyday for real ! !
To be continued to tomorrow ! !
Lang - 8 made me a lot of friends
I have a lof of friend from Lang - 8 .
Some of them I used to talked on skipe and MSN with them I was really happy to do relation with them .
All of my friends really nice and kind .
They are teach me in English when I have a question and do n't understand somethings .
They made me have power to study English wheather and cher me all the time I fell warm . I will read a book and comback to use my computer again .
The Disagreement of Using Automobile 1 . Please correct . Thank you ! !
Although there are some opinions that automobiles have many profits , I think that they rise more the negative impact they have had on to various things than benefitical impact .
There are two reasons : worsing the environment and decreasing a chance of communication .
The first reason is to worse the emvironment by exhast gasses .
The exhaust gasses from automobiles give the emvironment some negative impacts .
Carbon dioxide gas and NOx gas which is a group of nitrogeneous oxide are some of the its gasses .
In addition , it also made various living things extinct and still are forcing some animals and insects to vanish .
For example , one of the Ogasawara butterflies which only live in Ogasawara islands in Japan died out by climate change .
The second reason is to decrease an oppotunity of communication .
The unexpected meeting may give wonderful time to you and make your travelling more fun .
So you had better not use automobile but take a train , bus , and other public facilities for travel .
Many people enjoy using automobiles for shopping , travelling , of couse , driving .
But I think it is umprofit for us to continue using them .
Recently , it is the rainy season in Japan .
I hope it will be nice weather as soon as possible .
Today is the Sapporo on Business
Has a very cold snowing
The Food is delicious
At this time , I was in china for my business trip .
The adrenalin and the feeling of you are in the middle of the field , fighting for your life - even in a simulation battle - gives you a new level of confidence and power !
Yes , I know , Pantera was a damn good band and if you understood this reference I must tell you have a great musical taste !
But , backing to the point , I play Paintball for pure pleasure .
I joined a group of friends which all Sunday plays together in order to `` kill `` and `` be killed `` by a paintball shooted by a colleague just to overextend their weekly pressure .
So , in the end , everybody go home , happy and with a smile on their face .
It 's a quite different of the standard Paintball in most part to its rules and military characteristics like tatics , strategies , missions and moves .
If I should recommend a foreign visitor who has only one day to spend in my country .
For the following two reasons , I think he or she should go to Akihabara .
One is that we can buy a lot of new and rare electrical appliances .
There are more than 50 electrical appliance shops which display and sell various items quickly at Akihabara .
For example , I went to Akihabara last Sunday in order to buy an electric cord .
I had a plan to buy it first .
But when I looked around some shops , I wanted to buy some other new and rare items such as iPhone 4 which went on sale last months , some red lights which is used in police cars , and the DVDs of famous animation with dolls .
As a result L bought them besides an electric cord .
The other is that we can see original Japanese subculture such as comic books , animations , and games .
There are a lot of them Akihabara because electrical appliance shops sell them .
For instance , when I went to buy a game for PlayStation , I could see some persons who wore the costumes which the game characters wearing .
They are called the costume players , they wear them and go to Akihabara every weekend .
Such people can be seen only Akihabara .
In conclusion , I suggest that a foreign visitor who has only one day to spend in my country go to Akihabara .
Whenever I go there , I enjoy buying some new and rare items and watching the costume players .
When I arrived at home ( It was usually around 6 : 30 p .
m ) , my son and I took bath right away .
Then , I served dishes as I had prepared it the day before .
Then , I did the rest of household chores , took care of my son etc . . . . . . . . . . .
This week might be as busy as I was a single . . . .
Although he is populary known as a singer - songwriter , but I love his guitar play .
His guitar sound is surely like as his natural voice !
I was so impressed with his guitar play rather than his singing .
And I 've got a similar impression with Bob Marley , the most famous jamaican
Both great singer - songwriters played the guitar like their supreme singing .
Amazon Kindle arrived .
My Amazon Kindle arrived today morning .
I am quite dissapointed .
It is my first impression .
I bought it especially to read free e - books about e - business .
It has problem with pdf format .
When I convert pdf file to amazon 's format it doesnt 't look good .
I bought 4 - hour week book from Amazon and I am impressed how quickly buing is .
This is actually one click buy .
I hope I will know better Kindle and I will be more pleased about this purchase .
I am not a book lover at all .
Maybe I should have been buy a tablet instead of e - book reader ?
I 'll try to write a small review of Amazon Kindle on my blog .
In recent days , there are recording snow here .
So , this time , I made up the movie about white scenery .
And I up loaded on my blog .
I want to sent this movie to people who watching my blog .
I 'll try to finish a next movie tonight !
New term is began two weeks .
My classmates study more and more hard .
I felt so tired now .
But I 'll more and more hard .
Everybody , Please support me !
Today , I will talk about my hobby .
My hobby is taking a picture .
And I really want to get a single - lens reflex camera .
But I have no cameras .
So I always take pictures by cell phone .
A single - lens reflex camera has a lot of fascinating things .
And there are two reasons why I want it .
Second , it is that the image qualities are better than digital cameras preeminently .
I want to take pictures about a crowbar field in rainy day .
I think it become so beautiful pictures because of color contrast .
I have seen the scenery once , and it was so wonderful .
I never forget it .
I always take landscape pictures .
Sometimes flower that blooming in my garden , sometimes fallen leaf that has fallen on road , and sometimes the sky that not is at all .
Also , I do not like pictures with the person so much .
There are WABI and SABI in Japan , and I think Japanese do not like landscapes with the person like me .
Actually , I like one person better than many people .
Because of need not being necessary to speak forcibly the nature is easy .
I bought hair pin with a flower .
Anyway , taking a picture is so fun .
It is because things seem to be different from usually according to passing the lens .
And it is because of the lead into the discovery that it is new .
have a cold
ca n't stop runny nose .
have a sore throat . . .
took some medicine .
With the development of technology , the way of gaining information is not restricted in books anymore .
Various kinds of mass media are invented to accelerate our spread of acknowledge such as television and film .
Now I am going to analyze the advantages and disadvantages among books , television and film .
Books were considered as the only way of gaining acknowledge in old time and only certain group of people like intellectual and politicians could read them .
Even now , books has still played a crucial role in academe .
Take for example , professors in university use books as main teaching material and scientists record their findings in papers .
The accuracy of information from books is undoubted because the publishing of a book is through serious process .
However , reading books is a passive way to receive information and there are not so many people have patience to do it .
Compared to books , television has brought us to an adventure of enjoyment of vision which open the door of information spreading .
According to a survey , people in Taiwan spend at least 2 hours everyday on television at all ages which reveals that the attraction of television is irresistible .
There is no doubt that television has become part of our life for its entertaining effect so that TV is taken as a way to spread information .
Nevertheless , television brings some negative effects like misleading audience or exaggerating the situations for program needs .
Take for example , people with mental ill do n't mean they are violent , but mental ill is easily connected with violence in some soap dramas .
Film is similar to television but with more dramatic elements .
In my point of view , film targets on entertainment rather than giving information .
Take the movie of Happy Feet for example , we all know that we are facing the problem of greenhouse effect but there are not so much people take it serious .
After this movie , more and more people started to concern about greenhouse effect .
But the same like TV , there is too much exaggeration to be good media .
In my opinion , I would say books are the most effective way of communicating information , even books are not well accepted for everyone .
Do even television and film are absolutely the most accepted and well used media .
In terns of accuracy , I do think books are the most effective .
First of all , the food , drinks and tobacco were in the higher percentage than other items .
The Ireland and Turkey , they were near by 30 % , On the other hand , the rest of nations failed to reach at 20 % .
The Sweden , the lowest country , reached 5 . 4 % .
It has shown the different countries consumer spending were quite different .
But most of books which I want to read are English .
So , I start English study .
I hope this diary to continue .
Influenza is a few prevalent at my work .
An elementary school is .
My co - worker have n't Influenza at once .
She was n't vaccianted every year .
She said that everything depends on how you look at it .
Today , I did communication in English .
But it 's a very little talk .
She went to Hokkaido in Japan on last weekend , and then to explore nature .
If I could speak English , I would do better communication .
Sometimes I feel sorry to bother you for my low level English .
I think that this is good experience for me to talk in English .
And I enjoyed that talk very much !
if someday I die . what I regret ?
the first thing is I never buy something for my parents , and thank for them .
Today , I will meet a colledge student who has job hunting .
She is eager to resarch many kind of job .
I want to help her speaking my experience .
Fatty
Fatty was a very plump and obese guy when we were in senior high .
Nevertheless , he is very slender now .
Yesterday , I asked him if he is available this weekend to accompany me to look for language exchange .
He said , `` Sorry , I have to join a computer exhibition . ``
I replied to him , `` Oh ~ great !
what a nice show , you can absorb new knowledge of computers . ``
He responded to me , `` No , I just want to take some photos of showgirls .
If someone dares to destroy my schedule , I swear I will slaughter him . ``
Wow ~ Fatty is so serious on it .

One last thing : If I want to ask my friend where in Japan she used to live , can I say `` Nihon no doko ni sundeimashita ka `` ?
I got in touch with friends in Hokkaido .
I 'm looking forward to go back to Hokkaido in August .
My cooking was tired of eating .
Can you recommend good recipes ?
I really like this language and I hope to get to master it someday .
I think that the only way to learn a language for real is by using it with people who speak it everyday , that 's why I 'd really like to have some english and american friends who can help me to reach my goal .
Hope to meet new people through this wonderful and useful website !
After I have traveled in Australia , I 'm being lazy person .

As you do not check my previous entry , I 'm not sure if you know that I 'm working in a nursing home for people with special needs .
After adding some sarcastic comment to the beginning of my entry this time , I will begin the story of the girl .
Today was the first time for me to meet her and the last time for her to come to the nursing home .
Although I ca n't imagine what I will have been doing next year , her mother said she might come to the home next year .
I wondered how sad it would be if she had had been living in the time .
I lost my balance and fell backward .
I called for a help from other staff .
I did n't get what she 's going to do to me , though I wondered if she wanted to get on me again , she tried to put her little foot on my thighs .
My second finger is pains yet .
It 's difficult I take ( use ? ) a pen and others now .
From now on I have to more careful about door .
my maternal grandmother had an operation because she suffered from cholelithiasis .

it was worth staying up all night .

It is suspense movie and it won Academy Award before .
I was lost in thoughts after watching it .
I want to read novel in the original .
I sometimes ask my online friends about English although I know an English teacher among them even he is useless .
I always end up to solve my problems by myself or have to ignore them .
Unless you are trained or have a talent of language you can not teach other people your first language .
It 's not like rice cake , it 's bread made of rice .
I really like one I can buy in the nearest bakery .

Then I bought two piece of bread from a baker 's .
While I was leaving the baker 's the hostess said `` good bye , handsome .
need some beverage ? `` I said `` no , thanks . `` Then I feel better with my head .
After that I bought a chocolate and a can of coconut juice in a supermarket and then back to my room .

She was there on business and the earthquake attacked her a day before her departure back to Canada .
Acturally , she would have left the day before , but due to the engine trouble of her plane , she had to stay there for one more night .
Luckily , she was staying in a modern hotel with earthquake resistance , so the damage to the building was minimum and she did n't loose the access to the Internet , through which we got to know she was okay .
A few days after she got home , she wrote an article about her earthquake experience .
Here 's what it is :

Even native make a mistake , but I prefer to learn English nearly 90 % .
I 've got to ensure to studying hard .
Actually , during study abroad , I certainly study more than enough .
But I do n't stop learning .
I have just registered myself to this Lang - 8 .
I 'm working at the Airport that 's why so early .
I wish today wo n't busy day ( ^ _ ^ ; )
I thought the answe was ( a ) , but the answer is ( c ) .
Can you explain me why the answer is ( c ) ?
When we speak and write on Japanese , we do n't often use the subject .
I study English now , I always use the subject at writing .
Does it need the subject for English ?
They wrote a certain shape in black and white on the blank media .
I have never spun one .
I could do that , but my son could n't .
I had been prepared for exam about for 3months .
I thought the exam would be easy as I had been prepared it for a long time .
It remains to be seen about exam results .
I do n't feel like anything now .
I just want to catch up on sleep and take a rest .
And I 'll start over a essay on lang - 8 .
Health check !
In Japanese university , new semester starts in spring .
All of them look so happy .
I think they may feel excitement by fresh place .
At the first of the semester , we should be checked our health condition .
Check point are body height , body weight , eyesight and blood pressure .
In last year 's check , my height was 182 cm .
But in today check , it was 181 cm .
But problem was my weight .
Though my weight was 68kg in last year , it was 72 kg at today 's check .
I guess this increase came from a change of my lifestyle .
I bought a car last year , so I did not walk to go to my working place .
I must do my exercise for my health !
When I was in my teens , Japanese longed for American life , American film and American music .
The richest person in the world is not Bill Gate , just Mexican guy .
The impressive sixth sense technology was invented by Indian technologist .
We have to say that hope for the best and prepare for the worst !
Then you are chaotically looking for decision .
I 'd like to slim down .
I 'd like to lose a bit weight .
I 'd like to take in my waist a bit .
So I set aside time of exersise .
That 's Because I 'm going to the sea on coming vacation and I 'll put on the swimsuit .
I hope that I can lose weight before vacation .
Today I went to swim .
But while I was swiming , I could forget bad things .
I think I will go to swim .
I did n't write a diary since 2 month ago .
I went Nagoya last week .
Yesterday , I went to diner with my friends .
We eat fish .
Today .
Now , I go to a bathhouse .
I find those are useful and be worth buying .
But , the books price is very expensive .
One is $ 13X .
Another one is $ 15X .
And the notebooks price is $ 30 x 4 .
The total is $ 4XX .
Fortunately , I have a VIP card , it has discouct of 10 % .
I should hit the ball more effectively spin .
a long time I do n't was here . .
now I have not time , becouse this year I have exams . . .
and much time is spent preparing for it . . .
It was like yesterday when I started to go to junior high school .
It 's the last year I 'm going to spend as a junior high school student , so I want to enjoy the rest of the day .
hello .
I 'm new to this SNS .
thank you for reading this message .
Yesterday , I walked around my home because the whether was so good .
There are many tree of cherry blossom near my home , so I watched them with walking slowly .
The flower of it live very short , we are able to enjoy watching them in short terms .
Because of this I am sorry not to watch them till next spring , but I also think that it is the beautiful of flower .
I broken up with my bf last night .

I often wander . . .
I often wander what is the meaning of life ?
I do n't think there exists a logically reasonable answer to it .
I took a day off today .
Then I 'm writing my journal after a long interval .
I started to study Chinese because it is neccesary for me now .
I often met the foreigners who do not learn the language even they stay the country long period .
I can imagine , Chinese characters are quite hard to understand for foreigner .
Fortunately it is easier to learn Chiense characters for Japanese , because we use them in our language .
We exported the Chiense characters to our language hundreds of years ago , and the meaning of most of the words are still same .
We do not understand when we speak , but can understand when we write .
( Ofcourse , Japanese do not understand all of Chinese character , because they use much more characters . )
The pronunciation is so difficult , but I would like to keep try !
when I moved here , I knew nobody . I want to make many friends .
I 'm lonly .
I written a letter in English , first time of my life .
I wretten a letter today .

And this night , I read the book ' You should do 17 things in twenties ' .
After reading it , I must study English for my dream .
My dream is Introduce our culture for abroad ; anime , manga and so on .
Maybe its coming true is so far into the future .
But , I decide to have possibility .
hi everyone , , how are you all ? ?
I just want to ask you about this ( Odd )
actually I know what do mean
but I need more examples by using these two words to understand them more
and thank you ^ _ ^
Today I talked a girl by chat .
She lilves in US , and studys to be nurse .
She hates needles and bloods ,
Then I hear her various things .
and her parents is not real one .
When she was three years old , her mother was dead .
Her father do n't need her now .
She was groing up at another parents .
She tell that alone is confortable . . . . .
Her caracter is cheerful .
I think She willspend her happy life .
I do n't know what do I say . . .
She is impressive for me , japanese .
Because I 'm the 7th month of pregnancy .
I feel my body is heavy but I have to work as usual .
I have a daughter who is 2 years , so have to look after her .
I wish to take a hot spring bath and then have good foods at a Japanese - style hotel
Surely , it heels me .
Now a days , I 'm so busy due to get a hospital job .
I 've been trying to improve myself like character .
Yeah , , I agree too . .
But I have confidence this job very well , If they 'll employ me .
Fortunetly , I heard to pass the 1st test of the Korea University Medical Center .
2nd test is an group inerview so this is more important than 1st test .
If I pass this final test , I 'll work at Severance hospital .
It has very good medical team , high tech medical device and very kind service .
This is not fit for me , but I want to go there .
I have been a math matics tutor since 2005 .
Today , I started to teach a student who I have teached 2 years ago , again .
Her grade is terrible , so I ca n't sleep because I am worried about that very very deeply . . . .
How to teach math for her to be better ?
She have only 90 days to exam .
I wrote not long , because I got discouraget by learn english .
I 'm still at the same level and I ca n't learn to more .
Recently I had depresion because I did n't see the meaning of life .
play pooling
Yesterday I went to play pooling .
It was the second time that I played it .
The first time was in Nanxun ( URL ) .
I totally had no clue at that time and thought I would never go to play pooling again .
But I made a big progress yesterday .
and miss everyone .
so busy for these days , I just to say sorry .
Is there anyone who want to Skype ?
Of course I teach you Japanese as much as I can if you want to learn Japanese .
Anyway I have had a backache since I had a cold because I lay on my bed all the day and I had high fever . .
Now fever is gone but backache is getting worse so I 'm not willing to school because I sit down on a terrible hard chair while at least 90 minutes .
Besides almost professors only write the same as textbooks at blackboard .
I want to graduate this university as long as early and want to enter other graduate school or get a job which they have oversea 's branch .
Finally autumn has come here .
Many people had heat injury in Japan .
Hot summer is not only in Japan , but also in Europe .
I watched the news that many Rossian people were drowned because they swam in the river drinking vodka for cooling down .
Is this global warming effection ?
My workplace offered a healthcare course at the after five on today .
I felt it is fun but it is a little too hard for me .
I ate chinese food .
It tasted yammy because it was free .
so I was relieved .
I forgot to bring a thoothbrush .
Now , I am in the lab room ?
School swot , searching a job , and part - time job . . .
But also there is nice thing .
A girl whom I wrote 1th journal gave me a call .
I have n't said that , because she has a person who has a relationship with her .
he said `` I like you all `` .
So after that , I mailed her `` I know your kind heart and ability to chat sencerely `` .
I am so interested in World Cup held in South Africa just one year later .
Because I am a Japanese , I hope Japan wins to other national teams and go to at least semi final .
But as long as I watched two qualifying games against Uzbekistan and Qatar , to World cup , the reality would be different from what I hope .
Too bad , Japan would lose , and could not go to even round 16 .
The choice is not tan efficient way to get a goal .
Japanese player have to learn how to use these choices like dribble , pass or shoot in which situation .
If this kind of players increased in Japan , the possibilty to win in World Cup would be a little higher .
Every shop closed on Christmas day .
In Japan , this situation have never happened .
Unlike yesterday , many shops were on sale and there were so many people in the city .
I felt like today is New Years Eve ?
In Japan , there is no difference between Christmas day and 26th , the next day .
It is because shops give you a lot of discount before Christmas .
Actually , some shops in the city did n't give me a big discount .
That does n't mean almost anything .
But they usually sell them at the same price , and I am not sure that they are real ones .
I am very brand conscious , especially Japanese brands , so I do n't usually buy anything here .
I did n't buy anything then ?
( I was surprised that almost all water was gone . )
I will go to Otford in the morning , walk to Bundeena and stay there overnight .
This is one of my favorite quote from ' Poor dad and Rich dad ' .
Let me introduce my self in English .
I often listen to music by internet .
When I was young , I belonged to Brass band .
I 'm not particular about name of music , I just have fun of it .
I wonder where their music sense from .
They are gifted musician .
To teach someone my mother language is fun .
I 'm not good at grammar of my mother language but , at least I can judge whether it is natural or not .
In a spirits of volunteer , I 'll correct wrong sentences as a native speaker .
I may be wrong sometimes , at that time , please forgive me .
I have realized that Japanese was difficult through the teaching experience to non native speakers .
What is the right term when a patient of a hospital is discussed , `` patient condition `` or `` patient state `` ?
There are a lot of different symptoms exists , a group of doctors have a conversation .
What of the two above phrases is correct in this case ?
It 's almost time my husband come home .
There are Chinese cabbage and spinach and Japanese radish in the frige .
About meat , I have beef and chicken and pork .
What menu can I cook ?
I am not hungry , so I do n't want to cook now .
Now , my daughter suck my foot finger !
English songs have full of very native expressions , idioms and sometimes even stupid words .
This song have remained in my mind since when I first come across it .
Especially , I 'm in Kyushu , South - Western Japan , where is near Korea .
So , I recommend you learn some Japanese phrases .
Personally , I want you to use `` Yokarou - mon ! ! `` , means `` ( whatever it is , ) it 's good ! ! `` If you say this magical word , people in Kyushu would be more kind as usual . )
Of cource , I lilke Euclid as the great mathematician .
Trouble Maker
I am tolerant about my subordinate 's failure .
I am involved in several projects , that is , I have several bosses .
One of my bosses are a real trouble maker .
Every project members including me hate that my bosses always cause trouble .
I went to watch the Harry Potter movie yesterday .
It was the last episode of the Harry Potter series .
I enjoyed the movies of this series as well as Harry Potter books .
The main characters grew up through the series in several years , the actors and actresses did , too .
The last episode was interesting .
But if you will go to see the movie , you had better to read the original work before going to the cinema .
If you do that , you can enjoy much more .
sunshine in my window
sunshine in my window is very warm and feeling good but outside is very very cold with windy .
can you guess what I doing ?
how about you ?
I had to work very hard in busy everyday .
let ` s us enjoy with me .
I have gone through various things that everything were good for me and worked out , thank to my friends , I m really thankful to them who have supported me to live in Arizona .
The chances are that you can not guess that how stupid I am .
At lease , I had have vocabulary more or less .
However even though I spoke with American people or International students , I did not figure out what they said clearly .
at that time , I had been feeling huge sense of crisis and pressure .
A couple of days later , I started English quite hard , every time I finished the classes , I went to library for studying ; in addition to Homework , I studied the grammar books which I had brought those from Japan for a rainy day .
Actually it was a marvelous choice , For those could explain some grammar style plainly with Japanese .
what is more , I have tried to avoid from Japanese people in America .
I think that Usually japanese people who are going to university come here are not eager to learn or study English in Arizona .
in addition to it , they always hang out with same country 's people ; in fact , I meant they are also Japanese .
Today is last day of may .
Next month is always start rainy season ! ! !
I do n't like this rainy season . . .
becose commute train become very hot and make me bad ! !
But this year , I have a good things ! !
My best friend will going to marige next month ! ! !
I 'm very look forword to see my friend mariage ! !
He is very kind teacher , because he always encouragement to students .
I like to make a effort !
I have n't written a journal for a long time , but decided to start again and write as many as possible this year !
However , I try to use English as much as possible and even improve it .
Read newspaper
Therefore , I 'll read newspaper everyday if possible .
I do n't subscribe newspaper in my house , so I 'm going to the library to read it !
Make a trip by myself
I 'll go travel somewhere in the world by myself !
I 'll make it this year seriously : ) As a starter , I 'm going to go buy a loud alarm clock today that will definitely wake me up !
Ceremony decision !
I decided wedding center this Monday .
I went to 2 wedding centers .
First , it is like a guest house and good atomosphere .
It is a very convenient for me to work out a plan for marriage .
But we do n't invite company 's person , so not to formal wedding .
Maybe I think hotel gets a lot of marrige people per day .
So , hotel staff do n't have a time for a pair .
But I was to be relieved .
I was so exercited .
I can use comment function
explanation of about Japanese honorific word .
I think that it is very difficult for a person from another country to
understand Japanese honorific word .
It is because even Japanese people ca n't speak it correctly .
I want to do my best it ( ^ O ^ ) /
I introduce myself a little bit .
I 'm a marketer and a director for web advertisement .
My husband is a system engineer , but he quited a job last year and has been preparing for becaming a physical training instructor .
I 'm twins , have a twins sister .
I have also a brother over three years old .
He and she live in Tokyo .
My hobby is cooking , reading , fashion coordinates , and riding a road bike .
Today I cooked spaghettie Bolognese for lunch and baked a sea bream , tai with vegetables for dinner .
Do you know how to use the paid holiday in Japan ?
My husband tored his Achilles ' tendon on 9th of Octorber , and he has n't been able to work for two weeks .
He asked his company , what 's document he will need to take his sick day from the company .
His boss answered him , ' If you have paid holiday , you can use it for your off the works , so then you do n't need any documents which is written by doctor . '
Almost all Japanese employees do n't use their paid holiday , and they just use it when they are poorly .
I also did so when I had worked , and had thought about it is ordinaly things until I have been to UK .
I heared from them how to use their paid holiday while I had stayed there .
They shoud use all of their paid holiday in a year , and if they will be sick , they will have sick day .
One collegue 's husband who is an IT consultant , said to me .
I was really surprised to hear from him at that time , because I knew that he is very busy man for his works .
I was envious of UK 's people very much , but almost all Japanese people never known about the european people 's work situation at all .
But it is not ture or an wrong view of our life .
So he will be able to use them when he has got any sick or injury which he ca n't work .
If UK 's people ca n't believe that , probably .
I 've read a article that was really impressive .
I have been thought a great deal of things which he is essential person who I can not live without him .
But I m embarrassed to say that THANK TOU until now to raise me .
Of course I could not say this word in front of him .
If you guys are able to understand this article in Japanese , I would recommend you guys to check it out .

This test 's score influences to enter a collage , to take a job and the carrer success .
A lot of people so much study English to try to get a high score of the test .
Then , I want to know the value of the TOEIC 's high score in the foreign country .
Would you give me some comments of this theme ?
Yesterday I met in shop my last classmate Alice .
She has always been unfriendly , gloomy and unscoiable girl .
She had n't friends , because her classmates did n't like her and did n't want communicate with her .
But yesterday she greeted me with a smile .
I was shoked wnen I saw this changes in Alice .
And she learned the rules of communication and had new friends .
Today is a beautiful day , I waked up at 9 o ` clock , and had more delious food in the breakfast .
in the afternoon , I search interent .
It seems like a title of composition in Chinese primary school : p
I happened to see an episode of TV entertainment programme last night .
To achieve this , she was determined to save lots of money to prepare for a further study on dancing overseas .
That was taugh for a single girl in China .
She had to earn money in the day time and review dancing actions at night .
That was happyness she defined .
I would like to say , If language is drug , then I am an addict ~
It does n't seem that she know how to communicate well with people .
Now , it is 23 : 44 o ' clock .
In japan , there are many brilliant houses around my house .
Almost of hoses are using many LED lights .
Because Christmas will come .
Probably , I will buy a DVD recorder .
These fish are my pet .
My father takes care of them everyday .
Until last summer we had take care of two fishes about five centimeters .
When we started to keep them , the size of them were about one centimeter .
However , the size of them had became bigger by feeding food .
At that time , I found that fishes also becomes bigger like other animal .
They rarely do n't know what is they live for .
Sympathy is the outstanding personality .
About a month ago , I went to Chiba prefecture to see Tokyo Game Show with my friends .
We went there by his car .
The event started at 10 a . m . so that we had to left our hometown at 4 a . m . I 'm not good at getting up early , but I could manage to get up .
On our way to the show , we stopped by all the service area , and ate many kinds of local foods .
Then we arrived at the place for the show a little behind schedule .
The show was really crowded and was exciting .
We could see many many new video games , and took booth girl 's pictures .
I wish I could play video games whole day .
Now I 'm addicted to Ulfuls which is one of Japanese most famous band .
Although they 've already brokenup , their music is cherring people up .
They bring back me how wonderful
love of another person , even if I get depressed when hearing gloomy news on TV .
He is absolutely a greatest artist in the world .
If you hear he plays a cover song `` Bring It Home To Me `` , you 'll feel the goose bumps of touched .
I 'm going to watch SotialNetwork , today .
Today I 'm planning to go to a neighboring movie theater .
And I 'll have some beer with a friend from preschool days at night .
We 'll meet after 10 years interval !
It was long time to back here again .
I studied until now , abourt 3 months .
It was so hard time , but it 's over now .
Fortunately I was good at my test , past saturday .
And I passed first grade for entering master university .
And now there will be interview on 5 September .
After test , I took some rest .
But after today , I 'll earn some money , read books , do trainning ,
Good night there .
Sometimes we talked scary story .
Because In Japan , long time ago , there was not Halloween system .
This is a hot day , I do not want walk outside , but I do not want to have any encounter with my uncle , I agree the requirement finally .
we see panda2 at the cinema , I watched it last week , it will never be a happy experience when you watch a film twice .
when we got back home , I read some book ( I read a book , named java2 , should I say pages ? )
Three hours left today , I need study something before I waste it ^ - ^
It 's good to have friends who are from another countries because it 's fun to know each other .
Although many simply have limited English proficiency , I , as a science college student and engineer , have seen some highly - educated people who are capable of reading and writing articles in English , but have trouble verbal communication .
I have been feeing frustrated to see talented people who can not express their opinion due to English skill limitation .
I want to guide these people to become communicators .
I want to take part in intensive interactive communication training classes to improve their English fluency .
In my opinion , such trainings are apparently missing in current education in Japan .
The TOEFL and TOEIC is commonly used to measure English proficiency .
As a result , some companies set minimum TOEIC scores for certain job titles , thus people who have n't studied English for years restart English learning for a limited time for better positions .
Entrance examinations for high schools and colleges , and graduate school require English in Japan regardless of the chosen field .
With these facts , the importance of English is obvious .
I believe this is the adverse aspect of score - centered curriculum in Japan .
Students learn vocabulary , how to analyze grammar structures , and how to translate from English to Japanese and vice versa , but the ability to systematically coordinate these abilities and communication skills are insufficient as is .
I believe a more balanced approach focusing more on communicative ability would help improve English fluency among Japanese people .
Last night , I have gone to home party of my tango student .
A lots of delicias foods ,

but , at last everyone danced it !
so great !
Let 's dancing any place !
I wish I could go somewhere to enjoy something funny but there is n't some place to play around here .
So , I think I just can watch some movies to kill time .

I apologise that I 'll not sent you this translation that I promised you .
Yesterday I catched a cold and I have a terrible headache .
I 'll make this translation when I 'll be sound .
Today , I was invented by News Center of School of Science which is a part of Student Union to give a lecture about photography .
I am glad to do this .
Not because I was invented , but I am known as a photographer which fulfill my sense of accomplishment .
It does not take me so long to prepare the lecture .
That is what I familiar with .
However , many don not judge me from the skill of photographing , they even do not see my photos .
To be a real photographer need me to do plenty of practice .
And have a sharp insight .
The Golden week ( It is like Japanese holiday . ) passed .
But we had thought more nature place .
The all rode was made .
But we wanted to walk on nature 's rode .
This is very famaus place .
We both got excellent paper !
She apparently seemed to like it .
And we parent were also happy because we do n't have to take our time to entertain her
It was very tired day for me today .
As I said in the previous diary , I work for a factory .
That means , I wear working uniform and helmet during work .
People associate suits and necktie with business person .
I commute in my casual wear , and change clothes in a locker room of the factory every day .
It 's easy to work .
I had already finished reading some her works , for example , `` Confessions of a Shopaholic `` .
I read it up to about 20 pages today .
If I read it 20 pages everyday , it will take 20 days to finish reading it .
Because the Pulmonary Pathology Training Session was held .
Total 200 peaple participated in the session .
Pathologists including me were about 10 , Radiologists were about 10 , and Respiratory physician were others .
On saturday , the session started at 9 : 00 , it finished 18 : 00 .
That long time session wearied me , but I was stimulated with that contents .
I read a English grammar text book on the airplane to return .
I 'm a student in faculty of arts , Chulalongkorn University .
In this summer break , most of my colleagues will go abroad to take some English courses except me because the price is too high .
I 'm not rich enough to pay for the trip and I 'm not smart enough to win the scholarship so that I can go abroad for free .
It seems so childish but I think I 'm a little bit suffering from peer pressure .
I do n't know why but my English seems to get worse and worse although my major is English .
In my literature class , I have to read a lot of novels and study a lot of difficult vocabulary such as ' demythologize ' ( is there anyone who uses this word in real life ?
- - ' ' ) , patriarchy and etc .
It makes me feel like I 'm not even studying human language .
I think it may be because I did n't practice enough so I started to read and write in English more .
As a result , I become a member in this site hoping to develop my skills .
Thank you in advance for your correction
It is sleepy somehow this morning .
Let 's wake up drinking Black Coffee .
Does you also drink coffee when you are sleepy ?
What is important for our life ? What do we like most of all , family , friends , world , computer ? Our world is violent and we must like something in order to live in it .
Some people think , that their family is the most important thing in their life , that it helps them with different problems and always understands them .
The same situation is with friends .
They always are ready to help you and you always can rely on them .
There are a lot of things , that we like , but are the things which can love or help you ? I doubt .
Only our close persons or family are worth of our love and attention .
Each person choose important things only for yorself , family , friends , computer or other things .

As I told you , there was 30m long between me and them , even though they had rushed me by their feet , I could have easily escaped .
I found some stones on the road , I picked up them and threw them toward the black car .
I was too exicited , my head had full of adrenaline .

Poor kitty
Two kitty were born about 3 weeks ago .
One day my father told me that the cat gave birth to two kitty .
They are not belong to anybody and without home .
Yesterday morning my mother told me that the mother cat felt very sorry because she had lost her baby .
What 's wrong with her baby ?
She is so sad and we feel very sorry for her as well .
And today I knew the latest news that two babies of the mother cat have lost maybe forever !

The library sent me an email to inform that a book I reserve through the library 's HP was available .
I stopped by at the library to fetch it on the way home this evening .
It is the book I had once borrowed but faniled to finish reading by its then due date .
I wanted to read it again so reserved it two months ago .
At last I got it .
However my eagerness has faded .
I like rainy day , the rain make me feel comfortable in my heart .
The rain in May , like a faraway friend , brings me a lovely gift .
But in rainy day , I often think of many things and people in the past , it always make me feel lonely and sad .
A familiar music or a sad movie will wake up my memories , bygones often make me cry , with the rain outside .
I often tell myself : Let bygones be bygones .
Today is a gift to me , I should treasure the happiness by my side now .
I received a present from my parents .
There were many things in the box ; food like a melon and chocolates ,
vest and hat made by my mother .
I was happy .
Damn , I almost forget write in my diary .
Umm , I almost forget what happend today . > < I was very busy and tired .
Morning I went to Guangzhou and visit my mum .
By the way I tried to call phone of some friends to tell them I am back .
But damn , they are not in that city . > <
She got the Academy Award through this roll .
The movie was very interesting and it was for matured people because it contained some scenes which are not good for child .
have a limited vocabulary
I regard , arduous to read English texts .
But for what ?
Tthese days I have watched the lastest episode of Gossip Girl , the pleasing thing is that I think the story is coming back to normal , I mean the episode before were kind of ridiculous .
Every time watching the series , I always feel unbelievable .
As the people in that series are so rich and have roxious lives that I ca n't imagine .
And in fact , I wouldl never have the lives like their 's .
But this time , I saw a sentence that impressed me .
The charactor of Gossip girl , Nate , he said `` Growing up , I never knew what I was supposed to be . . . `` .
His saying was touching me .
I always try to find my way in the future or expect myself to do something , but in the end it seems that I find nothing .
Maybe not to think too much is the best way to have good days .
I just ate food and then come to check lang - 8 .

but suddenly he heard the voices close to one 's ears .
at the same time , the right in his room went out .
and his room resounded with big laughing of children .
at next moment , he fainted away . . .
Learning English is not That Easy
I first fell in love in learning english when my first oversea trip to England 15 years ago .
( even now it is still suck but a bit better I think )
In England , I visited many places such as London Bridge , Madam Tussauds , and many many more
This week , I saw `` Water `` made by Canadian and Indian staff .
It is about lives of widows , in India , who are discriminated because of the Hindi bible .
The setting is in an orphan for widows in India in the 1940 's ( probably ; Gandhi is on the movie ) .
In my view , it is so sad , but I ca n't say it is evil 'cause it is a culture and religious fact .
I have a respect for any religion as an atheist .
I hope the discrimination is fading away though .
First of all , many young people are like to travel to other countries when they finishing their study from high school for learn new culture .
For example when you travel to Egypt you will learn arabic culture and you will know what they are doing in the free time .
Also you will learn some popular arabic words , and you will know what kind of food they are eat always .
When you come back to your country maybe you should work for a few years to prepar for study in university .
In my opinion travel or work for a year it 's will give the students a lot of expereinces make them successful in the futuer .
It rained heavily today , the whole day .
Fortunately , It was not pouring
out there when I went to the school .
, however , today was different from other days .

I have to go to the hospital twice a week .

I want to study english from now ! !
I 'm recently preparing for TOEIC and OPIc
Do you know about the TOEIC and the OPIc ?
Those are English proficiency tests .
The TOEIC is required to listening and reading skills , and the other demand oral proficiency .
In Korea , if you want to get a job at one of the best company , then you would need to mark a high score of the tests .
Granted that I become senior in university , I have to get and improve my score .
Maybe I could easily increase my TOEIC score relatively unlike the OPIc .
Speaking in English is very hard to me .
How could I speak in English with fluency ?
That 's it , I 'm half a century !
I celebrated this birthday with my family .
5O years between memories and future !
This week , we `` llreturn to `` lighters meals `` .
Now , Japanese wisteria is full bloom in a nearby park .
It is sweet with the scent of the flower around here .
I love the color of japanese wisteria .

Maybe we pulled toward each other . : D
It 's just s simple question .
The stationaly whitch uses for erase the pencil wiritig is called ' eraser ' in America , and ' rubber ' in England , right ?
Then how do you say the one which uses for erase chalk writings ?
I think ' eraser ' is OK , but ' rubber ' sounds weird , because it 's not made by rubber ?
Today , I worked hard and was very exhausted .
So I quitted to go to gym to workout !
It was a game of the soccer Japan representative yesterday .
I did not expect it of the soccer Japan representative either .
Every night , as soon as I go to bed , he came and presses his nose against my face .
This means `` Let me get into your comforter `` .
So I pulled up my comforter , and he slips into a space in my underarm .
He neatly hunches himself and put his chin onto my arm , and then , sighs with satisfaction .
This sound file was made by me and my American friend who is learnig Japanese .
I met her another community ( not Lang - 8 ) .
We , for the first time , acutually talked to each other .

You know who was born in the same date , do n't you ?
But in all social nets is written the date of November 3rd .

This is not a birthday day , this is birthday week . )
Among my friends we have a tradition do not give the presents in the proper day .
- I 'll give it to you once later , when you wo n't wait it .
So , I 'm already used to this so much , that when they presented me something it was more suddener .
Even my brother , who never ramember the date of my birthday ( but you can see it 's not a problem ) ) , said me that all what I paint is suck and presented me a picture . )
Now I 'm thinking all my presents is so amusing , so fancy , it 's because they really are , or because I did n't wait it ? )

A woman wrote a heartbreaking confession in a counseling article of a magazine .
She was a newly bride when she was raped .
The rapist was her sister in law 's husband .
Her husband was treated at a hospital and her sister in law was at the hospital to visit him at that time .
The woman told her sister in law about the incident .
Her husband and her sister in law prefer to save their faces from embarrassment .
Her sister in law adopted the woman 's son as an act to redeem her husband bad deed .
Up until now , her son knows her as his aunt .
Any sane mother would love to be recognized by her own flesh and blood but telling the truth might make the son to hate the origin of his existence .
Not because of his pure love of God that aspires him to be a pastor .
Today I read article about different ways to be happy .
One of them is write five items about smth , that was pleased to you everyday .

Using subway in Seoul ! : D
Most of the people use their own transportation card and it is really convenient in many aspects .
You do n't need to waste time to buy a card and you can get the transfer discount .
Also if you buy a foreigner one , named Seoul Citypass + , you can use some famous tourist attraction and restaurants in the discount price .
There are many interesting places and events in Seoul subway .
In the station , there is a small gallery , Gwang Hwa lang , for free .
It is small , but you can get a big impression by appreciating pictures and paintings .
Omisoka is Japanese word , and means the last day of a year .
I do n't know why we do these things , but they are our tradition and I can feel the end of a year .

Last Sunday , finally , my son has be able to ride a bike himself .
But I answered that we go there with bike together for a while .
Is ' The Exciting Saturday ' correct translation ?
This was my son 's elementally school event .
At the entrance boose , he showed a stamp map which was given at school and I asked the receptionist mother one more stamp map for my daughter .
There were many games , such as , Hula - Hoop Throwing Game ( a conpetition how long meter they throw ) , Catching Paper With Chopsticks , Scooping Water Walloon , Dropping 1 Yen Coin to the bins in an aquarium tank , Pitching Game , and so on .

And there was a boose giving snow cup with syrups as a present to whom they did three games .
There was a boose of tea celemony .
That was opened from 9 : 00 to 13 : 00 .
We ended almost the game at 12 : 00 , so we returned home .
We went there with bike and that was my son 's first time to ride his bike to go somewhere .
I was annoyed about his accidents but he could ride safe .
When we returned home , we meet a foreign teacher and a pupil girl of the English School .
I thought that they would be able to go to the event .
That 's an event of this community .
So , if the school is the member of this neighborfood community ,
they would go there .
At 16 : 10 , my son will go his swimming school .
I 'll leave my daughter at my parent home and go the elementally school .
I think I would be able to come home after 30 minutes , so I said him that if there were no person in home , please wait the entrance of the apartment building . . . . .
Will I be in time for his coming home ?
I 'd better get a move on !
I read about them on magazines but never listened to their songs very seriously .

But one of the cats named `` Wow `` has much louder voice than any other cats .
He has really `` wow `` voice especially when he used to ask something to eat .
But mostly , they are very quiet and spend their times to sleep .
Sometimes I wish I were cat and sleep all day and they were human to feed me .
What is the three people learning ?
If you learn only by hearing , you will be easy to forget , but if you additionally tell someone what you have learned , you will be hard to forget .
To teach someone is not only someone 's learning but also making you be hard to forget what you learned .
How to get the fandament of other languages
The first step in studying Langage
I strugled for seeking the way to get other langages ability efficiently .
I had enough money to go langage school ,
so I have to study by my self .
After 5 years seeking , I find one of the ways to make the faoundation of otther langages .
I think we have to fill our brain with fandamental sentenses of the learning langage .
When we have to use the langage ,
the sentenses appear automatically .
For filling up your brain with the sentenses ,
it 's efficient to hear , to speak , to read and to write the sentence any number of times .
For practicing this way the text published by Maruzen , [ TOIEC traning ] series .
This text exprain the way of fandamental training .
Of cours the way can be apply another text containing fandamental sentenses with CD
When you try the way at first ,
I recommend you to use this text .
It 's efficient to learn the correct way .
Mow I aply this way for learning Chinese .
I 'm looking forward to the day I can exprain the effectiveness of this method for getting other langage ability .
chat on the phone
I got a call from old friend .
I 've been still married .
I know I 'm work - holic , right now .
and I forget how do I enjoy my life . . . . .
I had a night - mare last night .
It was when I was an army life .
However it 's not planed and there are many dvidences .
As soon as police start a search , I would be arrested by them .
While I had a troubled mind , I pretened not a criminal .
And I woke up then .
Today morning a truck hit a pedestrian on the street .
Went to Church for the First Time
In China , Christ is not popular .
Spending Chrismas , a foreign festival , in a `` foreigal `` place sounds very interesting .
Today , I 'd like to write about the way of thinking .
There are a lot of thinking styles and they are published on some business books .
A lot of ways that I am faced with .
Of couse the best way is different , but I actually think it is worth thinking the concept of designing .
Looking for the essential elements is a good concept for doing something creative , I guess .
I 've mowed all the field where my mother keeps to grow vegetables .
My mother was satisfied with the clear field .
Because my wife does n't like pears very much , I do n't eat them so often even though I like pears very much .
Because of a traffic jam on the highway , when we were on the winding and rugged road , the sun almost went down .
At that moment , I could n't help but imagine weather something would rush and show up suddenly .
You know what I talk about `` The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . `` ! !
I 'm the kind of people who grow up in a big city , so I have less chance to contact with nature .
During the 2 - day trip , I picked up wood , rode a ATV ( all - terrain vehicle ) on a wooded path , and observed deers and hogs .
And that means the exams are around the coner .
Oh , no , again !
It seems that the Chinese students are more anxious before exams , compared with others nations ' .
Perhaps it is due to our esucation systerm - you come to school to study , the school gives you a mark on your paper .
And that 's all .
Maybe the opinion is too radical , we should see it in different lights .
We see world through our color glasses .
Impartiality is what everyone purpsue , but no one succeed .
Well , no more words .
The exams are priority now .
Review , and get a good mark !
I take a two English classes in University .
The another is intended for Japanese students .
Most students are active to the class .
I think teacher try to teach enthusiastically and he is good teacher .
I have only memorized the textbook before entering university .
But the situation have changed since entering university .
We have to think deeply and act based on my will .
So , I try to argue with many people not only memorize the knowledge .
Maybe , in other countries , it is standard that students have a chance to discuss , but
The government need change the education system . . .
library you will be the most precious place I have ever gone
if you ask me the best place I have ever gone .
I will tell you the answer is library .
when I am a freshman of university , the biggest feeling is that I am free .
like a bird flee from a cage .
the unique thing in my mind is that ; `` I will only do things I like `` .
but now I know that it is a so dangerous idea .
no one will give me restrictions sounds like a good idea .
in reality it is harmful to me .
why it is harmful to me ? because I am addicted to computer games .
I spent about half a year in computer games .
until one day I entered library
the first sight I saw is so many shelves with books .
I like English , so I picked up a English novel called < pride and prejudice > , a famous novel written by Jane Austen .
I like the novel so much that I read it several times .
and then I find that I was in love with novel , so I read a lot of novels by different writers .
so library is the most precious place I haver gone in my college life .
The reason why I entry this site is to improve my English skill to study abroad in nearly future .
So , I 'm appreciate all your messages .

Fortunately , I have got help from two of them .

I miss the little girl lived inside of me
Growingup is a painful and lucky thing .
At that time I have done and said lots of foolish things .
At that time am just a cowardly girl who get unfair treatment from others and cant stand up for myself .
At that time am just a ugly duckling where my classmates think am ugly and treat me as nothing .
But at that time I am kind I never gossip about others .
At that time I am thankful for anyone who is being kind to me .
l At that time I love looking at sky just because it 's pure blue .
Now , am not that little girl anymore .
I think twice before I speak , I can hurt others back if they ever hurt me .
I have people who back me up , because they likes me .
I dont have time to look at sky anymore , since I am busy to give others who I need a babylike smile to make them like me and reading lots and lots fashion mag .
Looking at the photo I took when I were a kid the pathetic little girl is sooooo ugly .
If you met a ugly short shy little girl please be nice to her , dont hurt her or do anything to let her change , let her be a angel a little more while .

The Super Moon is a moon which is the most nearest distance from the earth and it is full moon at the same time .

On the contrary the upper class people in England love to drink beer of the normal temperature .

When my hostfather drank beer with ice , I thought it was very strange .
Because it was the first sight for me .

My English skill is not learn yet ,
but I will lean English perfectly .
Because someone teach me English .
I speak Japanese as mother tongue , German fluently and English limited .
I learned for one year Swedish and Chinese at the University in Germany because of those interesting intonations .
I completed my studies in the spring of 2010 and started working in the autumn in the same year .
I wanna improve my English skills , but I 'm too lazy to learn English language . . .
So at least I try to watching DVDs in English , to write diary every day and to read papers about language acquisition , phonetics etc in English .
Recently I thought that most of people are rude and angry , so , to be honest , I didn ` t like them .
Every sunday I go to the chorus at 11 o ` clock .
That day my father brought me to the place .
But after 10 minutes , that I spend searching for anybody , I understood that my teacher and friends - singers are not there . . .
Ok , I decided to go home .
Then I understood that I have no money to pay for bus !
But my street was so far away !
But unexpectedly I get an idea !
I could call my father and ask him to bring me home !
So , I noticed a lad , standing near the cafe and listening to the music .
I asked him what I wanted , and he smiled , giving me his `` nokia `` .
I smiled in response and entered fathers number .
But he was too far from me , so , he couldn ` t help me !
I saw 10 rubles , laying in my hand .
I ringed off and looked at him .
I really didn ` t know what to say , except loud and sincere `` thank you very much ! `` .
That is not very great deal , but I think that now kindness is the heroic deed !

She lives in Japan for more 20 years .

This is the story when his funeral .
The method of the moslim funeral is the brial .
But in the case of japnese Buddhism , it cremates a corpse and puts a bone in the pot by the chopsticks .
The cremination is decided by a law in Japan , and the brial is permitted only in some very few areas .
And malaysian two people participated in his cremention unwillingly for the firts time . . . .
His wife fainted many times and cried , and then , the teacher was scary of the human bone , too and really hated caching the bone by chopstick !
because I have n't thought that the bone was scary so far when funeral .
And , besides , I looked by work many times now .
After all is everybody scary of the human bone , too ?
Hoping to move into the cloud - based money management
Some , such as Wesabe , and Shryk , has already closed .
Here is my request for the money management service :
# 1 free or a little bit of running cost , less than US $ 5 per month
I can not use multi - byte character in account aliases and merchant entries .
OFX files provided by Japanese banks includes multi - byte characters , so I can not import my OFX files correctly .
I send email to the support team a little while ago .
I think that Most Japanese banks are outdated , because they do n't provide such tools reporting and tracking cash flow , analyzing financial statement , and supporting to achieve our financial goal .
I hope they plans to provide them .
Is there any money management services you recommend ?

Is Japanese thin ?
My father is as high as me , he gets a white hair and fat .
Then my teacher said `` fat ! ? `` .
She and other pupils thought Japanese is usually thin .
But I did n't think he was very fat like foreign people .
He is a little fatter than me .
And they knew `` sumo `` , so they said `` sumo is fat , is n't it ? `` .
So I 'm very happy that they know `` sumo `` .
It is difficult to explain , but I always ruin my live .
When everything bad I try to be strong , happy , helpful , cheerful , but when everything is great I begin to seems sad , nervous .
maybe someone knows the answer or have idea , white as soon as possible !
You can attend ESL ( English as a Second Language ) courses which are held in the United States with your TV .
And the class is held in New York City of the United States .

I think that can be good chance to someone who is going to study abroad in the future , but also anyone who want to study abroad in your house !

Hi again , this time I want to ask for same body that to be learning spanish .
My inglish level of conversation it 's better than my writting , but I need to practice a litle more .
I d ' ont mind if your spanish level of conversation it 's not very good , I think that together we can improve our cualities .
If you are the sort of person that I 'm looking for , please contact with me .
I ran to work as I was listening to MJ 's songs this morning in wet wether gears because it was raining hard .
I wanted to run with his , but I did n't have enough time because the dance lesson was waiting for me .
The songs gave me a lot of energy to run ( or for running ? )
I 'm going to run home with his songs again ^ ^
It 's not my business but their own business .
My wife always told me that I should write about serious topics with formal words and expressions like other Japanese people .
What kind of topics do you usually talk to your friends ?
Do you often use formal words with a straigt face on your usual conversations ?
Noway .
When I was in Japan , I always chatted with my friends about many kinds of topics from the size of our dicks to the cause of global warming in Japanese .
But more than 80 % of our topics were quite stupid .
However , this is a real communication , do n't you think so ?
I do n't say formal English expressions are not important .
But writing and reading about only serious topics are pretty boring for me .
In my opinion , hitting on a local girl , making a local close friend and having argument about the Japanese porn cartoon industry make our English improve .
If you do n't know how to use bad words , it means you ca n't curse other people , therefore , you ca n't have an argument with a native speaker .
If you do n't know how to describe something with stupid expressions , it means you ca n't make other people laugh .
So you ca n't make a local girl friend and a close friend .
Why do n't you become stupid on lang8 ?
You really want to improve your English right ?
In former days I written about primary game .
But yesterday game was not primary game .
yesterday Korea did the final game with Greece .

Argentina is known as a great power .
So our country is also a little worried about getting your asses

I would hope so !
My brain go frozen , and I guess the only thing I do n't forg - et doing is breathe .
sometimes I think I would never be able to keep my gene in the database of the world .
Making a breakthrough wo n't be easy , but I suppose t - hat 's the very challenge I have to face eventually .
When I was chatting my friend on Facebook , she told me about this SNS service , I really did n't know such a great SNS serivice .
Probably I will be addicted to this SNS and try to upload my dialies .
So , I have to write about something about me .

he did n't want to pay money every time he goes to

I would like to speak English fluently , but I do not have friends who speak English , so I have been learning English sereral years , and my knowledge is still not enough ! ! ! !
It has gone by 1 year and 5 months since I left Japan .
I can say it passed slow and fast .
( I know only North America 's lifestyle as I 've never lived another area . )
Many Japanese people who I met here said , they want to return Japan , but they do n't want to work in Japan , because it 's difficult to find a work as same condition as working in Canada .
Monthly salary in Tokyo is definitely better , but you have to work late everyday and work even in the weekend .
Once they got used to work in overseas , it might diffcult to return to Japan .
I do n't know why , but Japanese people , especially people work in Tokyo are extremely busy .
I 've got mixed feelings , I feel like returning to my former work , and living in Tokyo since my friends are still there , but I just ca n't return to that lifestyle .
I thought I would grow in capability of learning until about 20 years old , as well as height .
Since then , it would decrease with age .
For example , when I was in high school , my grade was so bad that I could n't enter a med school .
I gave up a dream to be a medical doctor and I entered other university 's Faculty of Science .
But there I had studied very hard .
And in my researh activity about oncology , I thought I did n't have any choice to enter a med school to study the medicine .
Eventualy I became a medical student .
( In Japan , in Febraly there are entrance exams for most universities . )
Snow fallen yesterday early in the moring is melted over .
Today is a little bit warm

I have a problem with this plan .
I already have an appointment with the other ( or others ? ) friends priviously .
Are there any good solutions to keep all appointment ?

All people put their clothes .
Some put classical one , others put shaggy one .
Firstly , people chose their clothes themselves everyday .
Clothes can express people 's favorite .
It indicates people express their characters throughout their clothes .
secondly , I hear that clothing 's color affect to people who put on the clothes .
For example , a man put a red tie tends to become more agressive man , but a man put blue one tends to become more cooler man .
Some girl say that they feel calm and womanish when they wear Japanese traditional clothes .
By the way , I must admit that a lot of workers can not decide their clothes .
Police , doctor , and forces must put certain clothes .
This may be a evidence of non - relating between clothes and characters .
In conclusion , clothes have certain influence to people 's character .
People chose their clothes with their character .
I started Golf ! !

I Attended A Lecture Meeting
Today , I attended a lecture meeting about teaching of English as an international language .
A professor from the University of London came to my university as a lecturer and gave a lecture in English .
As you may know , my major is far from teaching of English .
The reason why I attended the lecture meeting was to see how English speakers made presentations in a formal situation and how the audience asked questions in English .
I learned so much from the lecture meeting !
For example , I understood that questioners needed to tell the lecturer their name and affiliation before asking questions .
My technical presentation class teacher advised me to attend as many lecture meetings or conferences as possible before making my presentations .
I want to attend many lecture meetings and conferences !
I came back to Lang - 8 today , and from now I restart my English study .

The drizzle reminds me of the dew on the tea - leaves in my hometown , then I remembered the green tea of my hometown .
I favorite green tea , especially I love the sniff of the green tea in the cup , and I love the memories about tea .
Every Spring , my mum took my elder sister and me to the tea fields and picked tea - leaves .
When my mun and my sister were busy in picking the tea - leaves , I like to find the birds ' nests in the tea trees .
Now , when I am tired , I will make myself a cup of green tea .

The Japanese Tea Ceremony
To tell you to the truth , I have any knowledge about the Japanese tea ceremony because I 've never learned about it .
Since I was younger , I have n't liked both the tea ceremony and the Japanese flower arrangement because I do n't like wearing kimono .
Right now I 'm regretting about it because I ca n't explain anything about them .
I knew that when we had the tea ceremony , both of my friends were very nerves .
All I could say was follow to other people doing .
It has long history .
It was hobby for them .
Today 's our plan was waring Japanese armors , but it did n't work .
Of course , we can view a very lovely Japanese garden .
There are some victims who suffer under pollution .
They worked in some American , Japanese or other international companies .
These factories are not concern about environment .
They release waste water without proper processing .
That 's why people get ill .
Mexico government established very strict law to protect labors and eco .
The labors in Mexico do n't get proper salaries .
They works in very terrible places .
The factories bride Mexico authorities .
When China has cheaper cost of labors , factories move there .
What they left in Mexico are pollution and discarded factories .
The corrupt authorities make people suffer and tortured .
I hope the situation will change so badly .
Since I had taken English classes from junior high school to university , finally I could have my opinion .
In addition , I am a person who ca n't speak and listen to English well too .
Even though in my opinion , my English is better than ordinary Japanese people , a little bit . . . . .
: ( Anyway , I 'm unskilled at English still .
Why Japanese ca n't speak and listening to English well ?
First reason is that Japan is kinda isolated .
I mean , No country borders Japan directly .
But when we pass across the borders , we have to pass across the sea .
So actually , Japan has fewer foreign people than other countries , which border on some ones .
Especially , I can hardly run across those who use English as their native language ( for example American , British and so on ) when I hang around a street .
So Japanese people do n't have an opportunity to run across them and communicate with them very much .
We do n't have a chance to be stimulated by foreigners either .
Second reason is that ways of teaching English in Japan are a little wrong .
: ( In most of Japanese English classes , we do n't need to listen to English very much , let alone talk in English with classmates .
If you were n't called on in class , you would n't be allowed to speak any words except for chatting with your friend .
The lyric of a new song
This is going to be the lyric of my new song .

not thinking , just feel .
I do n't have a good word for explain .
I got off at Ueno Station to eat my favorite Ramen , Ichiran , but it closed .
My girlfriend asked me to dinner , but I could n't make it , because I had a lot of work to do today .
I wore new business suits , but it rained when I went home .
I love languages , in particlar , the sound of English .
It feel like beautiful flow of water for me .
But sometimes I want to throw away everything .
I just only envy people who is smart .
Umm , sorry , I 'm nagative today , is n't it ?
Today , I returned my home lately .
It is 1 : 30am and I 'll wake up at 7am in tomorrow morning .
I felt that I need to improve Engilsh to litening and speaking .

tired today .
I arrived at home in the morning because of my birthday party .
I spend time with my boyfriend .
He and I ate broiled small intestine of cattle .
And then we chatter in the my car .
Yesterday , I was confused about what is critical thinking because the comment ; a lack in critical thinking in Japanese education .
`` Critical thinking consists of mental processes of discernment , analysis and evaluation . `` , which is quorted by Wikipedia .
In short , in my opinion , critical thinking means that thinking and analyzing by myself in order to decide what I want to or should do whenever facing with some burning questions .
However , in Japan , people still think normally of it is polite to fix their ideas on a consensus without struggling against someone because Japan is harmony - oriented society .
Thus , Japanese people , including me , may be poor at doing critical thinking .
We tend to comply something like a obsession of Japanese customs .
Thanks to this awareness , I make up my mind to try to put `` critical thinking `` into practice .
I found this good webiste and I thought it can help me learng english better .
Actually , I 'm not good in English and I 'm afraid of speaking English . . .

When I lived with my family , my breakfast was rich because my mother cooked for us .

It takes 5 minutes and is done .
Sometimes , I miss breakfast with my family .

Japanese people are very good at import other cultures .
Almost all of Japanese enjoy Christmas but Japanese Christians are only 1 . 2 % of the population .
Moreover Japanese Christmas has no relation to religion .
It lost during inporting .
Why Japanese people have been importing Christmas , is because Japanese people are fun of Western cultures .
For this years we have been importing Halloween .

I do n't want to pay for it , so I refused it .
After shopping , I tried to come back home .
Then , I saw a bus coming , then I decided to run .
As you guess , it was when the eggs were broken inside my rucksack .
When I opened my bag and saw liquid of egg spread .
Now , the egg dried in my bag , it seems like semen .
And if someone saw it and think it is that , it 's a shame .
What I want to insist is I have never tried semen in rucksack before .

There were a grandfather and a grandmother .

They came to Mashenka call her with them .

It 's not the first time it 's happening and it annoys me , but there 's no helping it .
It said some American conservative commentators censured President Barack Obama 's for gesture when he met Emperor Akihito in Japan .
Then , the President greeted with a handshake and nearly 90 - degree vow .
The commentators accused the behavior , according to the article .
In fact , the President has been criticized for its behavior even if anyone takes up the post .
I know they 're nitpicking at the President , but it seems to be childish .
They would know the proverb : When in Rome , do as Romans do . . .

It is often not a good thing to move to a new city or a new country because of the losing of old friends .
A number of people maintain that it is disadvantageous to move to a new city or a new country due to the losing old friends .
While the first reaction of some people may be to agree with this statement , there are compelling reasons to explore it more in depth .
As I see it , moving to a new city makes me strengthen my friendship and broaden my horizon .
First and foremost , moving to a new city make me own opportunities to show my old friends how multicultural and various the new city is .
Take my own experience for example .
Because living in a new city , I was able to invite my friends to visit an interesting city .
I had chances to become a tour guide to show them around a new city , Taipei .
Taking them to the place which is beautiful and they did not have chances to visit would strengthen our friendship and make them have a good time .
Without moving to a new city , I could not have opportunities to share innovative things with them .
Therefore , it is beneficial for me to move to a new city or country .
Moreover , I would benefit from living in a city which I have never gone .
I would broaden my horizon in a new environment .
I made a number of new friends who have different culture and background .
I was also able to go to the museums or exhibitions to improve my understanding of custom , culture , and history of a new city , which could also refine my taste for art .
Besides , I could go to the university by MRT rather than bicycle since there is convenient public transportation system in Taipei .
On the contrary , if I did not go to a place I never go , I have no idea about what a developed city it is .
Consequently , living in a new city makes my eye open and create more opportunities for me .
In conclusion , not only moving to a new city can strengthen my friendship , but it also makes me know this world .
There are a number of advantages for me to go to new circumstances .
However , I feel confident that the reasons I have mentioned above in favor of my point of view are stronger .
I have published a number of very short journals as if we use Twitter .
If you access following my web page on Twitter , you can understand what I 'm writing about .
Do n't look back , never .
Lifetime is short .
Person 's life is give out .
Everybody knows .
The hedgehog is a kind of animal with thorny surface and tender internal .
The two leads in this book are both fond of solitariness and refuge from others and themselves like the hedgehogs .
Through funny and humorous style of writing , the writer infers some questions worthy of thinking from common place life .
It 's a book about philosophical thinking .
I do n't understand what it says at the first reading .
But the second time , I just discover its interest .
In such a society where everyone is like a hedgehog , how do we keep gentle ?
Under the cultural difference and identification , the lead pursues the meaning of her existence all the time .
There is a lot of despair in life , but the beautiful time also exists , that is a forever life .
I 'm boring now .
so I am very boring .
The use of clutch
I have a question concerning the use of `` clutch `` .
When I watch a baseball game in major league baseball ,
I often hear `` a clutch hitter `` or `` a clutch pitcher `` .
In this context , a word , `` clutch `` functions as an adjective in order to descibe
the someone that is strong especially when he or she is having a
capital chance , right ?
`` If I quit the job , do n't you feel miss me ? ``
I gazed at him for few seconds with suspicious eye .
He looked embarrassed with shyly smile . `` . . .
But I 'll forget what I said today because I 'm stupid . `` continued to say .
When I got the train and had a seat , tears were running through my face .
`` You told me you do n't miss me even if I leave here ?
I belived what you said completely at that time . . . `` I thought in my mind .
I always want his words but he 's not good at saying his thought .
It eaily leads misunderstanding each other though , when small things that I notice every single day compile my heart , they turn out my humble wishes .
I felt like something filled empty inside .
I saw movie ' Life Is Beautiful ' .
I ca n't forget it during my whole life time .
The movie contents is in the Jew slaughter age .
A Jew man met a pretty women and they were love with each other .
So they are married and they have a son .
But German army tooks there and they were imprisoned the Holocaust .
But father was try to keep his son .
He does n't lose his laughter , wit .
He lied to his son .
He said `` This is game .
We will try to win on this game .
We will get 1000 point so we will get tank . `` In the end , the father successes keep to son .
But he died .
I think he is good father to his son .
If they were in the worst situation that he was try to be cheerful people for his son .
My situation is not worst .
So I will try to be bright people .

The new Hard drive , WD 500G , whose capacity is about 40 times larger than the broken one , cost me 52US $ ,
Although bigger has been good in the PC world , the old one means a lot to me .
The broken hard drive has served me for about 8 years , and there are also some important archives stored in it .
Yet I still feel sort of regrettable , this old hard drive finally goes to the end of broken .

Snow flakes is the masterpieces which nature creates .

Wecome back , robin !
My husband and I just had a talk about a bird nest yesterday .
We have an apple tree in our backyard which a brace of American robin nested and laid eggs the year before last .
We looked forwad to seeing the brace raising a brood .
But unfortunately their eggs did n't hatch , and they discarded the nest .
An unhatched blue egg left behind in the nest , and one was cracked on the ground .
Last year , no bird nested to the tree .
Maybe my husband had cut back branches so short that they were not suitable to make a nest .
I look the nest from the sidewalk so that I do n't scare the nest - owners .
I hope that I can hear chirp of brood from the nest .
And I sometime get errors which is line in the display .
I have already been using for 3 years .
I 'm still thinking that whether or not I will buy new one .
If I will buy it , I want a camera which is able to take in dark place .
Heavy Cold
I 've got a heave cold last week .
At first , my nose is running and I can not help sneezing .
Then one night , I felt my nose was totally stopping up , I could not breath at all !
I can not get in sleep .
Now my head is dizzy and my hearing is poor .
When people talk to me the voice is like 30 miles away from me .
It sense like a piece of paper covering my ear when I am hearing .
I am a poor patient now .
I hate to have cold .
My nose is still stopping up when I typing these words down .
I wish I can get better soon .
I have lacked the motivation to write an entry .
So , I do only correction for the present .
I just stay at home , do some homework on house decoration , I will decorate my house in October .
But when I accidently found this place , I said Wow .
Today I have lots of work to do , prepare the report for my boss and also the house decoration .
I think it 's time to have a job hopping , for doing work in weekend is n't really what I can stand .
I ' am preparing the introduction for my term paper at British history .
But I am afraid that I have a lot of mistakes . .
The History of England is very profound and many - sided .
It totals a huge number of events and the persons , who anyhow influenced it .
In each epoch there were key moments and figures about which it is possible to read a lot of the interesting .
I consider that one of the most ambiguous figures of English history is the representative of the Tudor dynasty , daughter of king Henry VII - Maria the First or as she is also named - Bloody Mary .
This name is still shrouded by set of secrets and legends .
There are no monuments put in her homeland , people associate the period of her reign with bloody massacres ; day of her death ( and simultaneously day of accession to the throne Elizabeth I ) was marked in the country as a national holiday .
We see the picture gloomy enough , but it has involved me in this historic figure .
Having read about the queen at a history lesson , I have started to search for the every possible information about her , to read various books , to see the films connected with her personality .
When I have looked an English serial `` Tudors `` , about this great dynasty , I became assured that my term paper will be about Maria .
I wanted to learn more about this strange , fanatical queen who has doomed to death a large quantity innocent people .
In my work I have tried to track Maria 's life from a birth , to the death .
I have collected every possible legends connected with her and the facts of her biography which prove that this person was historical and that it is noteworthy .
In Romans 8 : 8 side `` So then they that are in the flesh can not please God . `` We make decisions everyday .
Is it from my flesh or Jesus ' will .
My face must looks like the dark clouds .
It 's like that Peter walked on the sea to Jesus .
If I look around the world and not focus on Jesus , my flesh will be activated .
However , our Lord is so good , He saved Peter before he sunk .
Adjust our attitude .
Guide us .
I have no idea what can I say .
I hope my Engish composition can be better
I hope when I writing the theme of Economics & Accounting , do n't have the same mistake or dont have a lot of mistake . . . .
I hope be a better girl
I hope I can have more ideal of my own .
I hope I can do evereything by myself be a strong girl
which can come true ? ?
How hard I ll done above ?
I need someone support me
I lost , confused about myself , my future . . .
Karaoke party at tonight !
Sorry , I ca n't wirte English well tonight because I 'm drunk and
We only have 2 hours in Easter holiday . . .

Interestingly , when German move out , they bring all the things in their room , including kitchen , electric bulb and bath .
So , new room is just empty !
I have to buy everything initially .
This system is better for person to make a their own room , but is not good for transient residents like us .
I wonder how much it cost to buy furniture , electronic equiptment , , , .
My friends call me Haru .

There is much rain tomorrow .
I had a online English speaking training at RareJob today , but there were some problems .

But time was a cure .
language is one of core of competition
Tired of translate form Chinese from English , I 'm writting english diary immediately in here .
I understood my english very poor , but I realy like learn it .
Currently , global bushiness has been driven by langrly competition , in my opinion language is one of core of competition , especially English is very important in work and study .
I am 15 , studying in F . 3 .
I live in a small city , Macau , which is one of the SARs of China .
Apart from English , I am also learning Japanese because of Japanese animations and musics .
But recently I focus on Japanese too much that I have neglected the English study .
So I decided to resume my study by writing diariy here .
Sometimes I blame myself for why I have learnt English for around 10 years but still ca n't reach a high standard .
I am very weak at listening and have got only a narrow range of vocabulary .
Of course writing is one of the weaknesses as well .
So I hope I can really improve my English on this site .
At least to start with writing first .
the day before yesterday I saw my cousin use some extension hair . . .
and I ask her for the hair . . .

I want it too ! !
can you please buy me for some colour ?
' ' okay . . , I will ask first with my friend ^ ^ ' ' she replied me
in my mind . . , I want this five colour . . .
one just Rp 4 . 000 . . .
that ` s mean 5 just needed Rp 20 . 000
it 's okay . . , not too exspensive . . .
she send me some message . .
said the colour that I want just red and purple . . . ,
I 've began an interview process to hear a potential user opinion directly today .

There till 12 o ' clock was more or less good , but later again I felt weak .
Today and tomorrow too I took free again due even I infect my illness to other people 's , then would be a problem cause whole company would be closed .
Currently I 'm feeling better , all the day I spending my time in the bed and heal up .
I hope maximum after tomorrow I 'm going to be healed .

We stayed at my friend 's aunt 's house and they have 4 kids and we have 4 kids with us and I learned that kids like a person that pays the most attention to them .
Well , it was about my road trip .
I am going to make a new entry when I come up with the topic .
One of my dream .
I go to there since last year .
I 'm not absent from there .
But I do n't almost study in my home .
So I 'm not good at talking English .
I try to study in my home everyday from now on .
And I want to talk English smoothly .
It 's one of my dream .
Tomorrow , it 's black Friday .
It 's good for people , but my american friends said `` I wo n't go there because everyone go there and packed .
I started to use Lang - 8 from today , the first day in 2011 .
I stayed in England for a month up to two day before the Christmas eve in 2010 , which was the first visting in a foreign country for me .
That staying made me recognize that communication to others , especically people not only Japanese , is very fun .
Since my English is very poor , I was not able to talk to lots of English people .
By using Lang - 8 , I would like to improve my English skill and get a friends around the world .
- in Korea ( While the host is not even thinking of giving the cakes , the guest drinks the kimchi juice first . )
Soccer is more famous than baseball .
Soccer ball is bigger than baseball .
Baseball is harder than Soccer ball .
Baseball is as popular as Soccer .
Baseball game is as well as Soccer game .
Soccer runs as fast as baseball .
Sevaral months ago , I went to Montain Tai with a friend of mine and her mother .
she lived in shandong province , so I went to her home first and visit her mother .
after rest for a few days , we set out on the journey .
Mountain Tai is a famous tourist resort .
as soon as we arrived , we drew a detailed plan .
and decided climb up at 7 o ' clock pm .
so , we could arrived mountaintop before sunrise .
Mountain Tai is famous for it 's sunrise , but not everyone arrived here could saw it as weather factor .
so luky we are ! we saw it .
I took lots of photoes .
It 's a very good journey .
It 's the 3rd lesson I take , I want to learn how to singing .
But sometimes I really hope I can enjoy singing like others does .
This music class my do me some good , but I am not sure .
Because last time we sing a sentence for the first time .
Our homework is learn a song and sing in tonight 's class .
Then I will found if I have learned singing .
Probably , the temperature was under 10 degrees .
But I really feel happy as I heard the motorcycle 's engine sound in front of my salon .
It was Kawasaki , which has a masculine image .
He took a motorbike tour in Hokkaido this summer , he almost run around in Hokkaido .
I have went to there on my motorcycle to Hokkaido long ago too , but I have n't run around there yet .
His story made me happy and inspired me to do same thing .
Studying for exams is very very interesting .
These are good for me due to having a lot of knowledge of business .
Especially , accounting is great because these entertain me and give useful knowledge .
Then , let 's start studying again .
A few month ago , I went to Ueno Zoo .
Ueno is located in Tokyo Japan .
I wanted to see two pandas .
When I saw pandas , one panda eating bamboo grass ; another one it sleeping .
A panda is very cute animal .
I love it .
But when we see a panda , it is necessary to stand in a line at long times .
I do n't like it .
Because I get tired .
Yester day was rained hole day .
I like rainy day .
I do n't know why but I just like that sound .
Is there something to eat on a rainy day in other country .
In korea eat buchimgae on a rainy day .
but our familly have n't had buchimgae .
How comes we forgot about that .
Instead we ate chicken watching the world cup .
fm is lunguage study suite .
I study sixty word a little while ago .
By the way , I saw I take school on skateboard in dream .
But I falled in front of school .

I took an examination of phisics today .
But there are still tests , mathematics , English , German , and electric curcuit .
So in this evening , I eat out with my friend .
Maybe we eat ramen .
I start to write this diary again .
2 years ago , I had to study for an entrance examination and was in trouble .
To tell the truth , she is a vocal synthesizer .
Not only pro singers , but also amateur can create their own music .
Some people sang those vocaloid 's songs and made their debut as pro singers .
I think it is interesting that anyone make sound , anyone make lyrics and anyone make HATSUNE Miku sing .
Thanks to her , we got various ways of enjoying music .
For example , `` KAITO `` is one of the vocaloids which sing in man 's voice .
I want to try to create my own music someday .
I think better I 'm gon na sleep and be happy .
My friend just leave me so now I have no one to talk : ( haha sounds sad but not to much . . .
[ What interested you libraries and information science ]
Actually , I accidentally enter this department .
Then I saw this department and I was n't sure about what this is going to learn , but I thought this might do something with computer which I 'm quite interested in , so I decide to give it a try .
I got plenty of things I like to do , like drawing , designing some handicrafts , singing , baking , playing volley ball , listening to music , etc .
I guess it 's because I like to make something out from myself which will make me feel a great achievement .
Summer break here begins from end of June to the beginning of September .
is important for my live u .
But I do n't get well .
Hey , last night my father came back from work and glanced at me and said , ' I guess you got weight somehow . . . ' .
I checked my weight on the scale , oops I did get weight 4kg .
I know it 's not that big deal , but I wanna stay sharpe boddy .
From this morning , I started to work out and run , and did it just before .
Noy is still in front of her computer and maybe spent more time with her computer to do alot of thing .
but she will come to Lang - 8 sometime to write her diary for a while and come and go .
she can stay at his house without without boring a hot weather .

This is one of the latest biggest news in Japan .
It is said that he killed a Brilish 22 - year woman who was an English teacher lived in Japan .
( I do n't remember exactly how old she was , sorry if I am wrong .
He has had plastic surgery many times has changed his own face , an d had kept running away for nearly 3 years .
I heard that his both parents are doctor , he was smart was in great college .
So I thought he maybe had a lot of pressure , and that might be related to this affair .
I think that 's one thing we must n't do ever .
I thought he might be relieved that he was arrested .
I read a news about this on the internet , it said someone says he is a good looking .
I feel really sorry for a victim ; a lovely British woman , her family and also for a murderer 's family .
I wish the world piece without horrible murders like this , disasters and all bad matters ! .

Based on my experience , those saying Japanese is easy to master usually turn out not to have a sufficient command of the language .
Today 's opponent is the most strong team in my area 's college .

When I went back to Japan and had another trip to Kagoshima , Southern part of Japan , I asked for that fruit .

When I was a child , my dream was to live with a dog .
If he stands up , his heigh is same as me .
When I go back home , I say `` hello , I 'm home ! `` .
Then the dog come for me with his tail wagging .
Because I have a job , I do n't have any confidence to take care of a puppy .
However I read some dog magazines and I imagine to live with a dog .
Now , I want to have Welsh Corgi !
We need English as official language ?
They think if they continue to use Japanese as official language , they ca n't employ overseas people that ca n't speak Japanese but have excellent skills .
Furthermore , Rakuten intends to sack the corporate officers if they will not learn English until two years later .
The employees that ca n't use English also will be reduced .
I heard that now they use English at meetings even though all attendees are Japanese .
Some Japanese bloggers say that it 's the excellent decision because Japanese employees will be able to communicate with overseas employees and customers more easily than before if they will learn English .
Usually overseas people can understand English even if they 're not from English - speaking countries .
On the other hands , there are people that criticize it .
Even the employees that have high English skills ca n't convey detailed intentions in English as well as in Japanese .
Japanese employee will not be able to communicate well each other .
It will bring adverse effect .
I totally agree an opinion that English is important for communication .
How do you think about it ?
A student cheated on Kyoto university 's entrance exams .
Meanwhile , it attracted controversy in Kyoto university 's and the media 's actions .
Some people reproach not only the student but also the actions .
My English teacher told me this web site , and I try to write

I must learn English , but evryone know my level is too low .
When I was a juniour high school student , English class teacher laghed at me , becausemy pronunciation was unique for him .
Everyday I 'm very busy at life and job .
Only I study a foreign language , I feel happy .
Good speaker maybe is not goodworker .
I am not a goodworker , always I had some miss .
I took my sons to a hair cut salon this morning , and then went to a one coin shop Daiso .
My 2 - year - old son like to have him held in my arms .
I usually say to him , `` Let 's walk with your own foot . `` , but he returns to me , `` Hold me in your arms , please ! ``
Because he forgaved to buy his favorite snack .
I met a boy on net last night .
And chat with him for about one hour .
He is working in usa .
and he told me that my english is more fluent and better than his coworkers who came from china .
Many of them have worked and lived there so long time , But their english is just so - so .
It is funny .

Many Japanese people will go to the shrine when babies become 1 month old .

I dropped my ipod touch in toilet bowl last week and it went down .
Only three months ago I bought it , but in this case the trouble was caused by water , thus it was out of guarantee .
It was pity .
A trouble by water ca n't be fixed , so I exchange the ipod touch for new one at Apple store .
It costs me 20000yen ( about 200 dollars ) to exchange , which is half a price of new one .
I want Apple to make waterproof ipod .
When I was a child here in Japan , there 's no grounding , which lasts for a period .
I remember I was crying and bumping to the door .
Today , I went to Odaiba in Tokyo with my friend by his car .
Unfortunately , today is so windy ; it 's a bit hard for us to walk .
The problem is being out of breath . ( vv ; )
How can I write a nice personal statement ?
Teacher aksed us to write a personal statement , and she showed us some examples in which there are various tragedies such as parent divorce , serious illness and car accidnet .
We adopted a pussycat
We hear cat 's crying when we were walking and come to see that .
When we see this pretty little cat we could n't left it alone .
He is ginger and white color with pink paws .
Now he 's in well conditions and always runs and scratches .
In my opinion lang - 8 is a good idea for people who learn foreign languages ; D I ' m sure , I ' ll make a lot of mistakes but it ' s really important to try our abilities , isn ' t ?
I come from Poland and I ' m eighteen years old .
I ' m intrested in history , literature , sport , geografy , religious etc .
In my free time I read books ( my favourite - thrillers ; D ) , meet with friends and watch movies .
I haven ' t done too many interesting things recently , because I ' ve been so busy in conection with the end of the semester in school but winter holidays are close ; )
( In school I have German too but I hate it : P ) .
thinking about 4 chan by 2chan mad
It fascinated me quickly .
It has dirty jokes and full of vitality .
I 'm 2chan mad for decade , and I deeply likes hutaba channel , which influenced 4chan 's culture and structure .
Using real name is rare .
Japanese youngsters often talk as if IN 2CHAN , about ideas from it , and sometimes say `` I 'm 2channeler `` .
But it is a decade ago when 2ch was started .
So I should get used to new way now , possibly .
They enjoy throwing dirty words .
And I think they are less problematic .
Compare to 2chan , thier hatred seems disorganized .
In 2chan , they attacks mainly week people , especially Koreans or Chinese in Janan , integrated people , womans , and anyone who has weakness .
They throw dirty words each other .
they call everyone as fag .
Homo or straight , man or women are not the point .
They call homo as homo fag , straight as straight fag .
They call white as pig , black as nigger .
So , there is weird equality .
But I think it 's better to see Tokyo tower in NIGHT !
And other photos are Zojoji temple .
Hello veryone I am come back .
Thank you for take care .

The game of Japan soccer team will start right now .
Everyone is not alone , for it is every persons that consist of the society .
On one hand , some persons hold the view that one should be rewarded after doing a good deed .
No doubt , it is kind of traditional Confucianiam .
For my part , I firmly believe that one who has a kind - heart should be given a reward or applous .
Because he or she deserve it .
It will has a positive effect on public as well , which would inspire more citizens .
At least , the public media , namely TV station , newspaper , not only report entertainment news , but also leave room for these outstanding ordinary citizens .
To sum up , more attentions should be paid on those kind - hearted persons .

There is a swimming pool which is located inside my neighborhood .
It is belong to an elementary school .
The main purpose is to teach children how to swim .
People are not allowed to jump water at the end of the pool because it is too dangerous .
The price is 50 NT dollars for the adult .
I used to swim 500 meters everytime when I went there .
I want to increase the range of swimming .
To make swimming is more cheaper to me .
A lady waved to me , she is a friend that I met her when I went to Swiming school last time .
I was so happy asa well that I still could find some friend who remmer me after one year .

I always write about movie these days .
Because I can find interesting culture difference on it .
I love music and dance , so I could enjoy it : ) I was amazed many actress are able to sing , dance and act ! ! !
I am fun of her since I have watched `` Almost famous `` .
Strangely , many people do n't understant that a man watch it just alone and some person feel shy .
anyway , I will have got to go the cinema just alone and then buy a sweet popcorn and cola and then enjoy the time just alone .
Maybe , I think that I 'm really a true man who really enjoy a movie .

I am going to stay at Bath tomorrow night , so I hope to sleep well there .

`` Princess Mononoke , `` one of STUDIO GHIBLI 's great works , took the hint from the atmosphere of the island .
Over 20 years ago , I was trekking to the top of the island Mt .
I groped my way forward with the help of a small headlamp and managed to reach to a hut .
I needed to have breakfast and prepare for the next step .
So , I walked down the trail I passed the night before to get some water .
There was not anyone but the tree and me in the mystic atmosphere , and I felt like he had called me there .
This experience has been and will be my precious memory forever .
Impact of the tsunami was far beyond imagination of us .
Today 's Happening to me
When we suddenly understand the language which we have been learning without thinking , it makes us happy .
Today I had an same experience to watch the Japanese news .
In Japan recently we hear a lot of brutal murders ' news here and there .
One of the most famous murders was arrested just thirty minutes ago .
After he killed a British woman who were teaching English in Japan , he had been escaping for two years .
The woman 's father had come to Japan to appeal to search the murder many times until he was arrested .
The police struggled to search him , and two weeks ago one efficient tips which he was witnessed in Nagoya was broadcast through the media .
At all he was arrested in Osaka though .
When I watched the news , the news caster suddenly spoke English and started to interview to the sufferer 's father .
When I listened to the father 's English , I could understand his English most of parts .
Since my daughter was curious about his English , I translated it into Japanese to her .
Usually when we listen to English interview through the media , we can read dialogs in Japanese .
However , the interview was suddenly happened ; the dialog did n't seem to prepare in time .
Therefore , I could listen to the English interview without Japanese dialogs .
The father was crying and appreciated to Japanese polices .
I would like to listen to English news more from now on .
If patent exhaustion was inevitable by conditional sales , consumers would enjoy more unconditional sales .
Under such circumstance , `` self - replication `` type products , such as cell lines or software , should need patent license to be replicated .

`` Tell about something which impressed you during this semester and something which has disappointed you .
Give three reasons for each . ``
help ! ! !
The class which impressed me during this semester is `` introduction for ( My university name ) studies `` .
First reason , a lecture is different professor every time , so I could hear different interesting lecture which is n't in my field .
Secondly , the points of each field are condensed in each lecture , so I understand educational
I do n't think out X (
To make a long story for short . ( am I right ? ) To be honestly I do n't have a long story , LOL !
I mean A person 's fight ca n't change the world , even ca n't change himself , so that means nothing .

This is definitively funner !
Lunch At A Goverment Office Building
Most big goverment office building in Japan have a canteen .
These canteens have been a good reputation for some years ,
Especialy they have often an original or special lunch .
Of course also we ordinary people can eat there .

There is Osaka Prefecture University near my house .
Although I neither am nor was a student there , I can utilize it , because I live in Osaka Prefecture and have the citizenship .
As long as the person have the citizenship , they can have the right to this `` public `` library .
It has too much amount of books .
In the past , it closes at 8 o ' clock sharp .
But this time , it 's prolonged its open time .
I can visit there even in weekday .
A month ago , my English teacher advised that we can improve listening by means of VOA or BBC .
Because of the poor listening , I choose the VOA special english - education report .
I almost listen it every day .
when the first time , I can catch some words and simple sentences .
the second time , I will read the text and translate it .
the third time , I can completely know every words and its meaning .
what 's your advise ?
How can I take well advantage of VOA ?
UNIQLO and Theire Business Strategy .
If you live in Japan , I am sure you have heard of UNIQLO or you have visited there .
It 's one of the Japanese most famous clothing stores .
I read its founder 's interview and found it quite interesting .
His name is Tadashi Yanai , a Japanese Billionaire .
He is ranked at 89 in `` Forbes billionaire list `` .
First of all , what distinguishes `` UNIQLO ' is they provide high - quality basics with an affordable price tag .
One of theire feature items is so - called ' heat tech inner `` .
It 's a thin inner but it in itself generates heat it 's very useful especially in winter .
Most of my friends in Japan were using it as an everyday use .
UNIQLO has now 750 branches including 4 abroad branch .
The greater the risk the greater the possibility for profits `` .
In my opinion , what he said is true but when you become a top , you are also responsible for your co - workers and theire family .
I also believe it has some interest in luck and your background .
You may need your parents support , a financial support , and some people succeed very easily because of theire family .
Now I just read a latest news that UNIQLO has announced that they were going to change theire company 's common language into English from 2012 3 in order to keep up with a global growth .
That 's interesting .
It is one hour 's drive from my place .

Can you see a small white part in the picture ?
I find that the Chiese exams is more difficult than English exam .
I wish I can be an American next life but can speak Chinese well .
But a local festival is supposed to be held today , so I had rescheduled today 's lesson . ) I had a spare time more than usual .
And then , I memorized useful expressions and words , although some of them were slipped out of my mind easily .
Well , the text books , which I regularly listen to , are piling up , so not only should I keep up with every lesson , but I should also review the back numbers not to forget the new words etc .
`` I not only keep up with . . . . . , but also review . . . . . ``
I met a man developing medical instrument there .
I 'd like to ask him the industry because I have been studying biomedical engineering .

This is my first time to write the diary on this web .
I never think about I can correct other people 's error in my native language .
I was starving , because I did n't eat breakfast and lunch .
Various and a lot of meats were served one after another .
I also tried a bottle of Peruvian beer `` Crystal ``
It 's so good for our health .
Sorry . . . Lang - 8 friends .
I 'd like to apologize for my ' not entering this site for a long long time . ' .
I had to prepare my Book Golden Bell , ( I Got Second place . .
but I was first in Third grade and Fourth grade : > ) Chinese letter test and most of all the computer test .
At least what made me happy was that I got 100 on Chinese test and got first place on computer .
Later this month , there will be a big test .
I hope you understand when I dose n't enter this site for a week or so .
There 's one comment that I want to tell you . ' I 'm sorry '
Is it correct ?
We had record heavy rain here and there in Japan .
Trains were stopped and a lot of roads are closed to traffic .
My daughter had to sit and wait in the stopped train for a long time on the way from high school .
The typhoon caused serious damages to several areas in Japan .
Some houses , many cars , and so on were swept away by the overflowed water .
I ` m living Nagoya in Japan .
and I ` m a university student major , mechanical engineering .
Japan hasn ` t much resources .
Now I belong to a university in Japan and I major in Dentistry .
From today , I have to take clinical trainings every day without weekends .
I was very nervous during training , but I managed to pass go .
At first , I have to tell you that . . .
All of my family and friends are safe .
I could n't go home at the night because of full suspension of the train service , and I walked to my home for hours in the next morning .
It was a good exercise for me .
( In fact , I was really scared at the earthquake . . .
It helped me continued firm .
We are faced to serious and unexpected disasters by the earthquake and tsunami .
There are people those who lost their homes .
We have recovered from crisises many times .
We recovered from Tokyo Daishinsai and Hanshin Daishinsai .
which laugage I should choose ?
if you were me , what will you do ?
germany - I have learnt for one year , but I can only read without knowing its meaning .
Japanese - I am really interested in it , but I know nothing about it now , I like watch japanese cartoon very much .
please you have experience on learning languages give me some suggestions .
It has been raining for all day long .
But , I was drenched with rain .
I had changed my dress at the same time I got home .
After meals , I have to study for driving test .
I 've failed it for twice , therefore I wish I pass the next test .
Today , one friend 's told me a funny history .
She was talking me about her travel to Scotland , when she remembered something about a t - shirt workshop .
And she told that :
`` We 're in t - shirt workshop , and my friends , who likes a lot rap music , decided to made t - shirts with a message that showed their passion by rapping .
And they wrote the tittle message ( `` I love my rapper `` xD ) .
When they were walking by the street , people laughed a lot looking at their , and they did n't know why they were laughing .
Then , they discover that `` raper `` in English do n't mean `` person who sing rap `` .
Then they were very embarrased about this hahahaha ``
I think that It 's a funny history , because there are a lot of times that we wrote something wrong because it sounds like spanish words that have got differents meanings xP
Yesterday , my friends invited me to go water rafting and camping with them some other time .
They always change their mind by following their mood .
Although they made a awesome plan on camping , I am wondering if they will fulfill it .
Technically , you may say that they are out of normal so you never know what their next step is .
Moreover , I hope that our camping could be sleep in a camper but not in a log cabin .
This is because I 've never been in camper so far .
On Saturday , I took a solo ride up to south area of Kyoto from my apartment .
There is a bike route run through the area along the River Yodo and then River Kizu .
I like this route because it is flat from beginning to end although I sometime suffer from wind that blows against me .
After leaving my apartment , I kept riding to the first point where I planned to have lunch .
I took a good rest there and started riding again toward the turn - round point .
There are tea plantations along the river , and I saw rice fields filled with water of which planting has been almost completed .
During the ride , many riders passed me as I was slow .
Although I worry about getting sunburn and am exhausted sometimes because of strong sunshine especially in mid - summer , I feel great when I finish riding .
I resumed to go to driving school .
In Japan , people have to graduate from driving school within nine months , once they entered into .
I entered into my driving school in mid - September , so the deadline of my graduation is in mid - June .
I still have three months now .
On the other hand , the cost I am paying to get driving licence is rapidly ballooning .
Judging from the progress chart , I would end up having spent more than $ 3000 just to get driving licence .
Well , most of instructors in school are nice and assiduously tell me how to drive and what I have to be aware of .
Yet $ 3000 is too expensive to me .
I guess , people can get their driving licences without spending such amount of money in other country .
How much money do you need to pay to get your driving licence or to complete driving school education in your country ?
Today is Thursday , and no special things .
Only one different thing namely I became an hour sender this afternoon .
Actually , I do n't like that .
I like to write code more than that .
But my case have finished in 3 months ago .
So , In addition to modify the bug ( it 's mean issue ) found by my client , I am not busy .
I took off at 7pm and went home by my motorcycle .
I 'm asking all of you including Korean .
I want to join off - line English group but I do n't know about that at all .
This effect is that the skin is renewed .
By my marrige I will go to este six times .
I wonder how I chenge .
we cleaned the windows , floor , and washed the curtains .
I 'm so tired after doing all of the things .
I was a couch potato .
but From now on , I 'm gon na study hard and work out .
Watching Asian game was a time killer .
But like someone said , Life is not a spectator sports .
As getting cold these days , I just ate over and over like crazy person .
Suddenly I just stopped watching TV and went out to walk .
I jogged and did jump rope .
I 'll go back to the days I live every moment .
I want to be able to speak English .
My First Singn in
I use this website for the first time .
Work Hard Study Harder Play Lesser
Busy at work and hardly managed the time between job and japanese class .
Thanks God the hard work got paid off .
I had good review and salary raise .
She is kind teacher and I like to study under her guidance .
He 's good teacher too .
It 's troublesome for working student like me .
I 'm dedicating free time for productive activity .
Only understand simple greeting .
I did n't fancy the coffee but the place has good hang out view .
At night Jakarta has good metropolitan view with lights everywhere .
I 'm not sure how to use this very much .
I want to speak English more smoothly and learn a lot of foreign cultures .
Doing that , I can see Japan more clearly than before .
And I was very happy , I think I will be addicted to learning English .
Make learning English as an interest , and work hard , I think I will make a big progess !
And thanks many Internet friends for correcting my mistakes !
If you need me about you Chinese , I will do my best to help you !
I Come Back
I come back becase the CET will be held .
It looks very terrible .
It seems to me is the devil .
In my point , the language is used to communicate for each other .
If you understand my mean and I kown what you say that is enough .
Why have somebody held examinations to want get your language level .
I ca n't see why the test scores can reflect our language level .
I thought about who I was
I am 25 years old .
Exactly what I thought was that I was bad and I needed to make me better .
What if I was better before than now ?
What if I 'm leading myself to the wrong way ?
One thing I am sure is I was n't shabby like this before .
The more I try to improve myself the more some other thing of mine is being destroied apparently .
I think I have made myself devastated in some ways .
Luckily I know how to go back because that was how I was
THE ENGLISHLECTURE
so I 'm looking for someone who teaches me English while learning it by myself .
Now I 'm trying to register the English lecture for next term .
What do you think of this suplement ?
My friend came to my house , when I was about to start studying English this
morning , But we enjoyed chatting .
While the chatting I recognized that she is into taking a supplement called
Japanese `` Kakusan `` .
that drink is quite effective for us such as allergic sickness cancer
diabetes , this suplement is just like all - around medicine .
But the price was too expensive to keep on taking for me .
people had a heated argument about that .
It made me more confuse .
She suddenly sat up on the bed , in the middle of the night .
Anyway , short story this time so you do n't lose so much time : 3 thanks to everyone reading and correcting and commenting n _ _ n !
today I 'm going to talking about `` friend ``
compare someone who shrases the bad and good
but , most of all best friend is like me in evey way .
One of my friend , Hiroki told me this site .
Hiroki , thanks !
So I want to improve my English writing skill here .
Golden Week - japanese long vacation
There is a long vacation called `` Golden Week `` in Japan from the end of April to the beginning in May .
The cost of travel rises very much compared with usual time .
I have not been to foreign countries in the season , but I plan to go to Hong Kong and Macao with my family this year .
There is a lot of delicious foods in Hong Kong , so could you recommend your favorite ?
When I was in China , I just used QQ chatted with my friends on line .
Although , I know Face Book was popular in the world .
but in China we could n't connect Face Book , because Chinese government just allowed us used Ren Ren which was copied from Face Book .
Maybe it was the first time used it I did n't know wether my friends are on line or not , lots of messages on the Face Book made me felt a bit mess , maybe 3 months later it will be more `` easy going `` .
Today is only part time job .
Recentry , my junkyard is very dull .
So , todays part time is 4past half until 11 .
Most commonly is 4past half until midnight .
It finished working when I went back home and went to bed early .
One day in a rainy evening a cat wandered around in lost , which was entirely wet and crying a lot .
The old man and woman named it ' Mique ' and treated her like their real child .
When a customer put the money on the table Mike suddenly swept the money down to a money box underneath with one cry of `` meow `` .
The customer was so delighted with rapture that he adviced the old woman to change the name of the shop ' Kakegawa - local power rice cakes ' to simply ' Cat rice cakes ' for the sake of prosperous business .
In a sense a custumer named their speciality ' Cat rice cakes ' .
He told me the result of the performance evaluation for the past six months .
I received the highest point in our evaluation system .
I 've never received that high point since I joined this company .
I was delighted that our managers had recognized my effort .
I felt appreciated very much .
Honestly , I get paid much higher than the average Japanese people at the same age .
In addition , thanks to this highest evaluation , I will receive huge amount of bonus this summer .
When I come to think of the amount of money which I receive , I sometimes feel a little bit guilty .
Even though a lot of companies and people are struggling with a global economic downturn , we always receive high salaries .
We ate salad and meet there .
In the end , surprise cake appered !
Skype is very useful appreciation , and we can contact with people around the world without any charge , but it has some demerits .
It is that we must sit in front of our computers while we use skype , but I can use skype everywhere with iPhone .
Deciding the date that is easy to remember is what 's important !
It sounds like `` thank you `` in English , is n't it ?
I went to an airport to see off my wife ( and our baby in her inside ) yesterday .
Our plan in the past was that we will go back to Japan together around September .
However , she has got pregnancy , so it seemed to be better for her to go back there as early as possible ( at least her mother 's opinion ) .
Then , I started to spend single life in the UK .
I found below site .
I think no ricense rider should be appriciated more .
Tomorrow , I am participating a volunteer activity of cleaning up a beach
at Kanagawa prefecture with my friend .
There was not a following tunami today ,
but now I became anxious about a tomorrow 's possibility of tunami .
The day before yesterday was a Indian festival .
Compare to Indian , I became a minority .
The looking of the temple is very majestic and spectacular .
Nevertheless , the next event is boring .
I spent 5 dollars to get the entrance ticket but I just stay over there for 30 mins .
This is because my friend would like to leave .
I was a little in bad mood .
If he had done it , we would n't have paid it .
I thought that it 's too tough for me to understand movies in English .
Then , we followed his proposal .
Although he is a nice dude , he is supposed to cherish money and spent it in smart method .
I 'll learn the word ' ' submit ' '
I 'll use it in trial .
I submitted my resume to the company which I want to work for .
I 'll submit some documents to the embassy for getting VISA .
I have to submit my homework to the school .
I got a cold . . .
- The size of his house gave me a shoke .
- As far as I know most korean and japanse people know what `` General character of each blood type `` is and I think they take its word .
I do n't know if others who are not korean or japanese know it or not .
- I have heard about `` Sign `` and I think it is similar to how `` General character of each blood type `` works .
my sign is Leo and it says Leo people are brave and active .
I usually take them just for fun but sometimes they are really right on me .
I would be surprised about this but now I think it is not that big deal .
well , it could be enough because there is a coincidence .
- Anyway I enjoy cartoons of General character of each blood type .
my blood type is B and it describes as Btype people are optimistic but capricious .
and they tend to speak out .
It looks like a perfect match with ipad .
You can insert the ipad horizontally into the slot while official apple ipad keyboard only can do it in vertical way !
And when you finish using and cover your ipad to the keyboard , it turns your ipad to an apple notepad immediately !
uhhh , I might be able to get it from some e - commerce websites here which imported it by unofficial way , but I do n't want take risk because keyboard is just a fragile toy in someway .
I have a little bit of question .
Are there some rules when I write `` Since `` or `` As `` on the top of a sentence ?
I entried Lang - 8 today .
I 've been studying English mainly .
In addition to it , I 've been also studying Spanish a little .

I had no idea ( did n't realize ? ) you were so sentimental . ``
The first man shrugged and said , `` This is the least I could do .
If you want to read the Chinese version , please click the below link ; )
though some people believe considerable proporton of rural students would put great efforts on learning , it is manifeast that there really is a phenomenon that rural students are to be more prone to difficulty of universities entrance .
in my observation , universities should render these students assistance given the reality that distinction between different areas .
even though , I have to emphasize the fact that it is commonly believed today rural students having been rendered in an inequality circumstance from their infancy onward .

He was one of the great pioneers of the modern Viennese movement `` Session `` .
To tell the truth , I went to Vienner for school trip last summer and saw some Otto Wagner 's buildings .
especially , I like the post office .
This post office Savings Bank is one of the World Heritagesite in Vienner .
This building is designed of aluminium and glass .
In those days , these materials were rare to be used .
That 's why Otto Wagner was called the great pioneers of the modern .

Visiting to Kyoto
I have lived in Kyoto when I was a university student .
I went to Kyoto with my wife and son .
I live in Shiga next to Kyoto .
It took about thirty minutes by car .
I bought some items such as a pen case , a Post - it etc with my son while my wife had SHIATSU ( a kind of body massages in Japan ) .
I used a sling that helps carrying my son .
It might seem to be IKUMEN ( We call the man who childcare hard in Japan recently ) .
Besides working on the task my professor assigned to me , I 've been still busy for my job - hunting on the Internet this week .
I only attended two job interviews until now .
I did n't have any exprience of purchaser position .
Well , I guess because it was a private company and one of the two interviewer was the CEO , so he asked whatever he wanted to know for it was HIS company .
No matter what he wrote it down for , I did n't like it .
The general manager said a lot to me , including her two oversea masters ' degree , her working attitude and high standard on candidates etc .
She said she was a ergasiomania who works 14 hours every day .
She was very proud that she worked 6 years in China , and then went abroad to work and get her degrees at the same time .
That was out of my imagination .
She asked my salary expection and how could I think I worth that much money .
It was a tough question , especially when she asked it in a aggressive way .
She said my expection could be reached after I work for 2 or 3 years and I have to work from the very basic position .
The problem was that my expection salary was the common standard in graduates .
At last , the sales manager told me to call her tomorrow if I decide to accept the job .
Becouse I go to faraway place I have not been and is good excecise .
It does not cost us a lot of money to go cyling .
I 'm university student , and majoring in Japanese literature .
Especially I learn about a modern novel and a Christian writers novel in Japan .
I 'm not much good at anything , but please be kind to me .
But I have a lot of homework yet .
I want to go to bed as early as I can ! !
University student is very hard .
Study abroad is neccary to speak foreign language to handle skillfully ? ?
How do you think ? ?
The exam is done only once a year .
Year before last and last year I could pass the first test but failed the sencond test .
I hope to pass the sencond test this year .
The result will be announced the of this month .

But it was possible if I could take a half day off .

My mother kicked her into the garden , because the little fella transformed into a musterdgas factory which we could no longer stand .
Iiiek , Vindottir feasted on this tasty pellets , since a little , wild rabbit is happily hopping on our grass field .
Fortunately , the pellets has worn off , so we can breath again , phew !
