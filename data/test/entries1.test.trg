A family , see m ing ly a father , a mother and two of their ch il d re n , get in a c ar .
F un k y m us ic start s , play ing some bad o b s c en it ies .
It see m s they do n ' t care so much about it s ly ri c s and ri d e on to the r h y th m .
This co m m er c i al f il m is re ally re f le c ting what happen s to English le ar n er s .
C h ar a c ter s of the sea s on s are comp le te ly different from each other in J a p an .
In sp r ing , we can see not only p l um s and ch er ry b l o s s o m s , but also a tra il ing mi st a cross mo un tain s which is a c r ow n ing be a ut y in the morning .
In s um m er , if you go to the country s id e , many f i re f l ies will we l c ome you .
It must be a f ant a st ic scene .
In a ut um n , es pe c i a ly l ate a ut m n , when you look at the re ed s f l ash ing ( ? ) go l d en and the leave s turn ing re d or y e ll ow , you will sure ly feel ha p p y , as if you were dr e a m ing .
In w in ter , s il ent s n ow in d ic ate s great in te ll i g ence ( / w is d o m ) which man can not have .
In respon se to the question as to which sea s on I like , it must be the time of sea s on al change .
I mi s s pass ing sea s on s with affect ion , while I a d m i re coming sea s on s .
J a p an e se va l u e e v an es c ence .
The be a ut y of the ch er ry b l o s s o m is not so much in it s appear ance , but it s e v an es c ence .
The life of a f i re f ly is very short .
I w an n a le ar n J a p an e se but I ' m so bu s y and I c a n ' t ty pe J a p an e se on this P C in the coming week s .
I like it here , so does K i ch an
It ta st ed very good ! !
It take s two hour s to co m m ut e to work to and f ro .
I take a sub way to work and change train s t w ic e .
I study my English b ook s in the train .
U s u ally , we us e them only when we go far away .
To day I need ed to go to the po st office to p ic k up a letter from J a p an .
I us ed a high way just to go to the po st office .
I think my J a p an e se friend s would never believe this .
J a p an w on against A r g ent in a ! I ' m so ex cited !
But I could n ' t see the game .
D o you know about M A N G A c a f es ?
D o es any on e know about M an g a c a f es ?
A M an g a c a f e is where you can read many many M an g a .
In the M an g a c a f es they give us se p ar ate room s .
The ir p ri ce s are l ow so many g en er ation s can us e them .
If you come to J a p an and your are good at J a p an e se , I suggest going a M an g a c a f e .
B y the way , M an g a c a f es have many different s ur r ound ing s .
They have good s ur r ound ing s .
In I K E B U K U R O , K I T I T Y O U Z I , S I B U Y A have good one . ( ? )
T h an k you for read ing ^ ^
It is the first time I ' ve [ I have ] come here .
He ll o ! !
Yes ter day , I went dr in k ing with my friend s from when I was co ll e g e st ud ent .
One of them is work ing for a J a p an e se a ut o m a k er .
Some time s he go es around the world .
en j ot it ! I ' m enjoy ing it !
I de c id ed to read al o ud us ing the A F N b ook .
The first se ction was the in a u g ur al address of B ar a c k O b a m a as the n ation ' s 44 th p re s id ent .
U s u ally I c ar ry my I - po d to listen to some m us ic and English pro g r a m s .
To day I found out a new thing about English .
The sen t ence is ( sp a ce ) `` I can not than k you enough ``
I felt this sen t ence sound ed like that person is n ' t gr ate ful .
Y e a h I le ar n ed to day one thing to day .
I put a fish , which was his f a v o ur ite f o o d , on his gra ve .
I can think of nothing , because I am tired now , or just p re ten d ing to be tired now .
What I am do ing now look s like nothing , but it ' s ( ? ) coming from no where , or it is just that I have to think more to find out what is need ed .
I have trouble with my st ud ies , live l i h o o d and my girl f ri en d ( who may leave soon )
I went to a c a f e near my school to read b ook s and I walk ed for a long time .
H on est ly I need to cha ll e ng e my G er man .
But it does n ' t mean that I ' m g i v ing up .
There are a l ot of students from va ri ous co un t ri es .
E ng l and , I ta ly , A ust ri a , S l o v a k i a , S er b i a e t c .
S in ce this was my first time meeting S l o v a k i an and S er b i an people ,
A l m o st all con ver s ation was in English , but I would have to say I had much difficult y co m m un ic at ing with them .
My co m m un ic ation s k i ll in English is not good enough , particular ly for listen ing .
In addition to that , every body had a different a c c ent in English includ ing me .
So they tri ed to me m or i z e it by as s o c i at ing it with `` H i ro s h im a ( J a p an e se c ity ) ``
It sound s funny , I never hi t upon such an idea .
But I think H i ro s h i is e as i er than H i ro s h im a , because it ' s short er , is n ' t it ?
N ic e to me e t u ~ ~ I ' m a fresh man here ~ ~ I was b or n in C he ng d u , C h in a .
I ho pe I can make friend s with you ~ ~
I ho pe every on e has a n ic e day ~ ~
T h an k you ~ ~ ~ ~
When I happen d to walk by the front of a k im on o sh op , a c ut e you ng c l er k we ar ing k im on o talk ed to me w h il st s m il ing .
Some pretty girl s we ar ing k im on o were in K y ot o or U n ive r s al S t ud i o J a p an in O s a k a on the picture s .
We talk ed about k im on o s and things for a long time .
The c l er k said , `` If you have time , why do n ' t you try this on ? ``
O f c or se I tri ed it .
I had enough time and I do n ' t have any k im on o s in s te ad of y u k at a .
The k im on o which I tri ed on was re ally beautiful .
I was sat is f i ed with try ing it on and had f un talk ing with the c l er k .
But K im on o ' s are very ex p en s ive , I c a n ' t a f f or d to bu y it now .
It see m s that to day will be a re ally n ic e day .
There are n ' t any c l o ud s in the s k y . The s un is sh in ing and there is no w in d .
A l s o , it is 3 de g re es C el s i us , but it is on ly 1 1 a . m . To day I ' m going to play b as ke t b a ll in the s k ate p ar k .
B y the way , in the N B A , the O k la h o m a C ity T h un d er s w on ver s us L .
L a k er s and are n ow 2 - 2 in the s er ies .
m E S T time , C le ve l and will play ver s us C h ic a g o .
I ho pe the C a v al i er s will w in .
It like the sp r ing had come already here in C h u b u are a , the c ent er of J a p an .
This is a quick di g re s s ion , and the head qu ar ter s of hot T O Y O T A is here .
And yesterday was my pay day , so I with d re w some money from A T M .
But it took me no less than 1 0 0 yen to with d r a w some money as it was on sat ur day .
you see , just to with d r a w money !
The b an k s are so bu d g e t - mind ed . Why should I pay money to with d r a w my money ?
What do you think about it ?
T h ough I make f us s over it , I take out my money on week en d s .
B y the way , I walk ed to the con v i ence st or e on f o ot since it ' s so close .
I could see many sp r ing f l ow er s out there , and I was able to feel sp r ing is act u ally around the corner .
I looked up other w or d s to mean w ar m and found `` as s n u g as a bu g in a r u g `` .
I found it is ver y interest ing .
My name is P h y ten !
I am a st ud ent in H it ot s u b ash i U n ive r s ity , and my ma j or is e c on o m ic s .
( He re is a l is t of my ho b b ies . . . )
P la y ing g u it ar , read ing b ook s ( es pe c i ally on business and f in ance ) , play ing bad m in t on , s ur f ing the In ter ne t , pro g r a m m ing , and talk ing ( cha t ting ) with my friend s !
A l s o we can play with our ne i g h b or s . No t only we can make good friend s but also we can sp en d qu al ity time to g e ther .
M a y b e I gue s s there is a saying , `` There will be for t un es to people who do n ic e things for their ne i g h b or s . `` .
If we sha re the f o o d s to our ne i g h b or s when they are becom ing poor , then we can get some f o o d from them when they become o k a y and I become poor .
N e x t , we should act in a polite and po s it ive manner to w ar d s our ne i g h b or s .
N e i g h b or s are the part of our life and so c i e ty , and all people like the ne i g h b or s who are very n ic e .
We should be friend ly , help ful , and act in a s u it able manner if we want to become a n ic e ne i g h b or s .
I ' ve finish ed my work .
I f i x ed some pro g r a m co d e .
On this line ' N in j a ' train s - train s with n in j as ' face s p a in ted on - run every day .
But the train I ' m tak ing is not a ' N in j a ' train .
It does n ' t mean I got los t but that I los t my b an k c ar d .
T i ll re c ent ly , I was always a b s ent - mind ed for some reason .
I kept think ing about things while walk ing on the ro ad or sit ing in the train .
A fter I found out that the c ar d was not in the right place .
I e m p t i ed my b a g and an x i ous ly c he c k ed it 3 ( three ) time s . with .
But I still could n ' t find it .
Then , I called my family to let them . re p or t the los s to the b an k im m ed i ate ly .
I c a n ' t do that any more .
But what can I do ?
I just got home , re c ent ly I ' ve been get ting back home l ate because of my job .
I re ally want to say than k you to every on e who c or re c ted my mistake s and sen t me a me s s age .
I am now ex change st ud ent in A m er ic a , and this is the first time I have ever live d without my family , so my p ar ent s w or ri ed a l ot when I said good b y e to them at the a ir p or t .
But I re as s ur ed them by saying that I would sen d e m a il s .
A t first g l ance , my room m ate act u ally left a very good impress ion on me because she was 5 year s old er than me , which made me feel she would s up p or t me in so many way s .
When I ar ri v ed at my room , she was with her J a p an e se bo y f ri en d , so she in t ro d u c ed him to me and told me that if I had any J a p an e se question s , I could just as k her bo y f ri en d .
I felt that I was so l u c k y that G o d ga ve me such a n ic e room m ate , because she seemed to be very pro te c t ive .
F or a girl who had left home for the first time , it re ally help ed a l ot ! !
A t least , she ga ve a made me feel se c ur e , though her bo y f ri en d always stay ed in our room even at the be d time .
To let my room m ate know that I would not be a th re at to her re l ation s h i p , I only brought up my question s when she was there as well .
There f or e , she ho p ed that I could turn to other J a p an e se for help in s te ad .
As a re s ul t , I w ro te a not e to her , apologize d and made it clear that I did not mean to up se t her .
If she felt hu r t , I would stop do ing it right away ! !
Even though her bo y f ri en d told me that he felt his girl f ri en d was too e m o tion al and that I could still con s ul t him question s when she was away , I de c line d his kind ness and hard ly spoke to him .
O ri g in ally I thought that everything would just go back to normal , to the very begin n ing when I was on good terms with her .
However I was to t ally wrong because now she only give s me the co l d should er .
L a st time , I f u z z ed every time as speak ing more than usual .
S ound s ir on ic , does n ' t it ?
What I mean is the more I study about express ion s or v o c a b ul ar ies , the more I ' m con f us ed , because every time I try to us e new things , it does n ' t come to my mind as a ut o m at ic ally as I wish , and it make s me m ur m ur ( ? ) .
It ' s because I have a school tri p on S ept e m b er 7 - 9 .
A l th ough I live in F u ku s h im a in J a p an , I ' ll be going to Tokyo in J a p an . ( F u ture T en se )
So I need to be read y for my school tri p soon .
I ' ll write about my school tri p when I get back home .
This le ad s to no where .
I want to try myself against the ma ter i al world .
O ur turn is at 1 4 : 2 5 .
I ' m going to my un ive r s ity , and start ing ch o ir p r a c t ic e from now on .
I live in a do r m with an in ter n ation al st ud ent from the U .
She is very good at J a p an e se and always help s me study English .
However , because she speak s J a p an e se so well , I some time s he s it ate to speak English .
M or e o ver , she always speak s J a p an e se in s te ad of us ing English , so I do n ' t have enough ch ance s to speak English .
There f or e , I try to de c id e `` O N L Y E N G L I S H D A Y `` and I as k her to speak only English d ur ing that day !
I ' d go back in time , if I could : (
A n n z u was a str a y c at and was pe c k ed by c r ow s in a p ar k , before a volunteer s a v ed her life .
When she came to my house for the first time , she was so s k in n y that we could n ' t hu g her ti g h t ly .
To day , I begin la ng - 8
I ' ve been study ing English since I was a j un i or high school st ud ent .
I can understand w r ri ten E m g l ish , for ex amp le new s paper s ,
but I c a n ' t listen and write English .
The class con s is t s of students and teachers .
I had to speak many time s , so it was pro f it able .
G o s s i p G ir l is a p op ul ar A m er ic an T V s er ies that was in t ro d u c ed to C h in a as a fashion and life style b ook .
In the show s , S er an a and B la ir are the most l u c k y girl s who are ri ch , beautiful , cha r m ing , and so on .
They po s se s s all the things which was most girl s want to have in the world over all .
The people in the up p er e a st live in a go r g e ous and la v ish are a , p l us they are el ite who know how to man age m ul t in ation al c or p or ation s even though may b e in he ri ted them from family .
O b v i ous ly , they are in the sp ot light in any part ies at N e w Y or k they go to at night .
We are mo r t al , direct ly I en v y that kind of bu le ( ? ) b l o o d people .
Let me c ite a fashion able w or d `` hold `` which is f ant as y of an am a z ing girl in C h in a .
I want to go to N Y some day .
One of the serious pro ble m s in J a p an .
I watch ed a T V new s b ro ad c a st which was about the high number s of s u ic id e among you ng er people around 2 0 to 3 0 year s old .
The new s said that the number s have con t in u e to in c re a se over the last 1 0 year s .
I think that most you ng er people in J a p an have no dr e a m s or purpose for the future .
Then they feel themselves as us e less to the world and that they have no reason to live any m or e .
A n y way , present ly , we are much ri ch er ma ter i ally than we have been in past , but our mind s have we a k en ed .
And J a p an e se so c i e ty is in a g ing so c i e ty . We are run n ing out of you ng er people in the work for ce .
Some h ow we must stop you ng er people from co m m it ting s u ic id e , or our so c i e ty will co ll a p se much soon er than we expect ed .
I went to O it a , my home town , for about three week s for s um m er va c ation , and I came back home three days a g o .
I felt a fresh a p p re c i ation of my p ar ent s this time because of going back to my home town .
I also re al i z ed how I had always had a l u x ur i ous life .
I did n ' t feel l on e ly before I went back to O it a , but still if I go back once , I will get a c c ust ome d to my old life with do g s , a s is ter and p ar ent s , so when I am alone again , I will feel very l on e ly .
But in fact , I ' m know that it is too bad for me because I ' m going a b ro ad to A m er ic a for four year s as a un ive r s ity st ud d ent .
No ne of my friend s live s near my house , so when ever I go sh op p ing , I am alone .
It is only a matter of time now before I start my class ( again ) , so I ' m look ing for w ar d to see ing my friend s now .
This happen ed a f e w month s a g o .
I was on the p l at f or m , wait ing for a train , as usual .
She seemed to be over 5 0 year s - old , and came near to
where I was stand ing , because there was public p h on e near me .
She put money into p h on e , then di al ed .
`` O h , I ' m sorry I ' m going to be l ate . `` the woman said in a loud voice that
She con t in u ed talk ing .
`` I was having a po o . ( l o l . . )
It was re ally big one so it took a long time to f l us h . ``
That ' s why I mi s s ed the train .
I ' m sorry I c a n ' t be there on time , but it could n ' t be f l us h ed ``
She de s p er ate ly explain ed that it was n ' t her fault , but her po o s fault .
Some time s people make ex c us es for their mistake s , such as t ar d i ness
However , I have never heard such a ch il d ish ex c us e .
O ther w is e , no body will believe her .
E ver y day , going to the office , I watch a v id e o on my i P o d to u ch .
R e c ent ly I ' ve been watch ing `` S es ame S t re e t ``
for the purpose of study ing English .
`` S es ame street `` is f un for me .
But it ' s ex c it ing story ti re s me some time s .
The w or d ' ex c ite ment ' mean s `` H i - ten s y on `` -
M a y b e it is bad English .
`` s es ame street `` is us e ful for study ing e ng l ish .
about `` less ex c it ing `` English study ing v id e o s .
I had a dr e a m that I dr o ve a c ar and it f e ll off from the ro ad .
I had to lie down before I c he c k ed the e - ma il yesterday .
So , may b e I think I might have an all er g y to po ll en .
In sp r ing I get dr y s k in and my eyes become very it ch y . . .
S t ud y ing English
He ll o , every on e .
My name is K A O R I and I live in J a p an O s a k a .
I had st ud i ed English while I was a st ud ent , but I c a n ' t understand English now .
This tra um a is very he a v y to me .
So , I de c id ed to start study ing English at this sit e .
P le a se tea ch me the c or re c t English .
So re c ent ly I have not up d at ed my di ar y .
I work in a tra d ing comp an y .
We receiv e te le p h on e call s from a b ro ad , take care of for e i g n c ust ome r who visit s J a p an , go on business tri p s to do re se ar ch at va ri ous con f er ence s and ex h i b i tion s .
I believe some day I will im p ro ve my English if I keep on study ing and up d at ing ( my di ar y on ) this we b s ite .
W ow . . what a good we b s ite this is !
This is my first time writing here .
I want to me e t many people from other co un t ri es !
I ' m very interest ed in class ical g u it ar , but I c a n ' t play well .
A fter I gradua te from co ll e g e , I would play the g u it ar free ly ! !
To night the W or l d c up J a p an v s P ar a g u a y game is on !
I want to s up p or t the J a p an e se tea m , but I have to go to my part - time job . . . .
D V D sh op have many d v d s : 2 4 , p ri s on bra ke , u g ly be t ty , go s s i p girl , f r ing e , and so on . . .
What is your re c o m m en d ation ?
The J a p an e se go ver n ment w ar n ed people that there was a po s s i b il ity of e le c t ri c p ow er f a il ur e in the Ka n t o re g ion yesterday after no on .
Tokyo p ow er comp an y had already stop p ed their s er v ic e in the s ch ed ul ed are a
but they said there was still not enough p ow er .
I f il led p la st ic bo t t le s , p ot s and bu c ke t s with as much water as possible .
We c a n ' t us e water if we have a p ow er f a il ur e .
My a p ar t ment is s er v ing water to each family with e le c t ri c p ow er .
F or t un ate ly , we a v o id ed the c ri s is , al th ough all the A T M s te m p or ar i ly did n ' t work at one ma j or J a p an e se b an k .
The F a ll a p p ro a ch es .
It was ra in n ing day . It was ra in ing to day
The we a ther in K or e a is a little co l d d u e to the change of sea s on s .
F or that reason , I thought about a l ot of things .
So , now I ' m ment ally over l o ad ed .
I should do something f un !
Yes ter day , I hung out to re la x .
I walk ed from S h i b u y a to H ar a j u ku and return ed to S h i b u y a .
It was a n ic e we a ther , so I felt well .
It was a ha p p y day , because I went to a sp ot I never go .
I for g ot what I want ed to write about to day .
My ce ll p h on e was n ' t work ing well .
I thought my ce ll p h on e f in ally b ro ke down , because it did n ' t re a c t even after I p re s s ed the but t on s .
I almost los t my comp o s ur e .
I not ic ed that my friend ' s ce ll p h on e is the same ty pe as mi ne .
He was study ing , but I b ro ke in because I did n ' t a f f or d to care for him .
He told me some i nformation about the ce ll p h on e and suggest ed that I call c ust ome r s er v ic e .
A fter he had finish ed his story , I tri ed to call c ust ome r s er v ic e .
The moment I called to the c ust ome r c ent er , I not ic ed that I was us ing my ce ll p h on e and it was work ing as usual .
I think it is because of my a g ing .
E ver y time I write an es s a y , I us e a l ot of the same tra n s i tion al w or d s .
If you know a va ri e ty of tra n s i tion al w or d s , could you please let me know ?
I have had l ot s of work to do , but I need to keep my le ar n ing time some h ow .
It ' s difficult for me to do two things at the same time .
But I ' ll try hard , ho p ing that I can keep up at least once a week .
I want to be an in ter n ation al translation volunteer .
So may b e I should p r a c t ic e English of ten , ho p ing that L an g - 8 will help .
O ut s id e was too hot , so I went home e ar ly and stay ed in the living room .
The reason why is that the living room is the only room that has an a ir condition er .
I live in S a in t P e ter s b ur g near the me t ro st ation `` P l o s ha d My g est v a `` .
This st ation is not sit u at ed in the c ent er of the c ity , but I very of ten go to the c ent er to walk on the beautiful street s .
M an y of S t P e ter s b ur g ' s street s still have some sp e c i al his t or ical f e a ture s .
L it t le co ur ty ar d s , narrow street s and bu il d ing s from the 1 9 th c ent ur y s ur r ound you and can im m er se you in this f ant a st ic time .
And a l ot of c ar s , sh op s and co f f e e house s c a n ' t b re a k this i ll us ion .
You can walk in this c ity for many days and every day you will dis c o ver some new de ta il s of this at m o s p he re for you s el f .
M an y time s I just walk on `` N e v s k y pro s pe c t `` and go to A le k s and er N e v s k y square .
Some time s when I ' m not in a hu r ry , I just turn right or left at r and o m cross ro ad s and a im less ly walk around the little street s to feel the un i qu e at m o s p he re .
If you are ever in S a in t P e ter s b ur g and you have a l ot of free time , I a d v is e you to just walk around the c ity for one or two hour s without any p l an , and you will feel the un i qu e at m o s p he re of the 1 9 th c ent ur y .
I was surprise d at / by how big they were .
I thought that the se c u c um b er s were more than t w ic e as large as one s in J a p an .
I re c o g n i z ed that even the same ve g e t able s can have / be different sha pe s .
I began us ing L an g - 8 to day .
I ' m not good at English , there f or e I think that I should write short sen t ence s every day .
This is my first time writing a di ar y .
I ' m J a p an e se . I ' m 2 1 year s old .
My name mean s ch er ry b l o s s o m s , which is the most p op ul ar f l ow er in j a p an .
I live in Ka n a g a w a p re f e c ture which is near Tokyo .
I ' m le ar n ing about ' E n v ir on ment and H um an ity ' in my U n ive r s ity .
My ho b b ies are da n c ing , listen ing to hi p - ho p m us ic and going to m us e um s .
In M ar ch I ' m going to go to C o l or ad o S t ate U n ive r s ity in the U S A .
If you find any er r or s , please c or re c t them .
My year end re s ul t will come out this T h ur s day .
I feel pretty an x i ous wait ing for this day .
I ho pe to pass with f ly ing co l o ur s !
Even though I try to write short ent ri es , I re g re t that no body c or re c ted yesterday ' s ent ry . . .
You do you think I should do to get c or re ction s ?
P le a se give me some a d v ic e on how to get more c or re ction s .
W o ul d you please c or re c t the ent ry I made yesterday ?
Yes ter day I went to a hot sp r ing and the b ook st or e .
The hot sp r ing was very good .
A t the b ook st or e I b ough t a te x t b ook on English pro f ic i en c y .
Some day I want to be pro f ic i ent in English .
I went to school before going to the hot springs and b ook st or e .
It was to me e t with fellow teachers .
I made c he e se c a ke and de l ive r ed it to the fellow who had to work .
( * The second picture is a view of the near b y hot springs . )
M a th is a very im p or t ant sub j e c t in K or e a .
If you give up on this sub j e c t , you give up on co ll e g e .
But I am re ally poor in ma th .
I c a n ' t understand ( it ) at all .
When ever I try to so l ve a question , I just get st u c k .
How I can get better at ma th ?
so I de c id ed to sen d a present for her to day !
She like s to eat J a p an e se s n a c k s so I de c id ed to sen d her a p l ent y of J a p an e se s n a c k s .
M o st of it are ri ce c r a c k er s in different ta st es .
I can not see the end of the t un n el .
I can not go back , and all I can do is to go for w ar d while to u ch ing the wall of the t un n el .
I some time s ex pe ri ence f e ar , de p re s s ion and l on el i ness , but I have to con qu er them if I want to become a f l u ent English speak er .
I almost los e my con f id ence of whether I can do it or not . . . . . .
It was too co l d to us e my room to day .
The he at er in my room is not w ar m enough , so I de c id ed us ing my la p t op in my living room .
A ccord ing to the we a ther new s , this co l d we a ther will last unti l tomorrow .
I wonder if I ' ll us e my room tomorrow .
I do n ' t like to go out d ur ing a long ho l i day , every where is c r ow d ed with c ar and people .
It ' s not easy to go for a f e w me ter s in a tra f f ic j a m .
M o st of C h i an g M a i re s id ent s will stay at home for ce le b r ation with f a m il ies , while the visit or s from around the world ch o o se to co un t d ow n on the street .
H a ve you see n any a c c id ent s on the street in this sea s on ?
A fter the ce le b r ation s finish , the dr un k en dr ive r s need to go back home , but they always los t their con t ro l in dr i v ing .
D ur ing this f est i v al we wish there was less dis aster or los s .
The police st ation has a s er v ic e to provide a c up of co f f e e or a f o ot ma s s age for a long dis t ance dr ive r .
We have only a small ho pe that there will be less los s than last year .
O ur long ho l i day last s from 3 1 st D e c 2 0 0 9 to 3 r d J an 2 0 1 0 includ ing the begin n ing and finish ing day . It ' s six days in to t al .
L ate ly , I sp en d a l ot of my time on the comp ut er .
The reason is that it is on my t able .
When I start us ing the comp ut er I go ma d with the in ter ne t .
But I c ur e that now us ing this pro g r a m :
This pro g r a m show s how much time you sp en d us ing the comp ut er
So since I ' ve started us ing this pro g r a m , my comp ut er time has go ne down
It ' s re ally s um m er , is n ' t it ?
It ' s . l u x ur i ous !
It ' s re m in is c ent of a ta s te d ur ing my ch il d h o o d in my home t ow n .
When I close my eyes , I can see myself eat ing c or n , sit ting outside in front of my house .
A ll of the do or s and w in d ow s are open , because there is no a ir [ sp a ce ] condition er .
In my home t ow n , there is a very beautiful ri ver .
Some time s we went to the ri ver with c u c um b er s , to m at o es , some c he a p me l on s and o c c as ion ally water m el on s .
It was the most enjoy able time for us students .
I still re m e m b er the c u c um b er s and to m at o es , with j ust a little s al t on them . They ta st ed very good !
But please do n ' t as k me what I at e for dinner yesterday .
I had a p re - speech con t est to day .
U n f or t un ate ly I did n ' t make it to the f in al because I made a f l u f f .
I was also told by a teacher that I made a f l u f f because I did n ' t speak from my heart .
That was a blow to me .
I know this is kind of a small matter but it was very , very re g re t t able any way ! !
P le a se give me your a d v ic e .
A t this class , l ot s of people were A m er ic an teachers .
A fter that , I draw a picture about tree s .
A t that , we s un g a l ot of B e at le s ' so ng s .
It was de l ic i ous but , I was still hung ry .
Then , I s un g a so ng called `` U n d er the S e a . ``
I could n ' t s un g very good because my voice was so high .
To day was re ally full of f un , because we did a l ot of things .
And I ' m interest ed in F u el C e ll re se ar ch and the In ter ne t .
There are n ' t any st im ul at ing things at the U n ive r s ity .

When I turn ed my comp ut er on , the s c re en was b l an k

I mi s s ed it in J an u ar y since I got the f l u the day before the t est .
There f or e I ' m glad to be able to take it this time .
I wonder if my English v o c a b ul ar y has been im p ro v ing d ur ing this per i o d .
I had my ha ir c ut to day because s um m er is coming soon .
The le ng th of my ha ir is pretty short now , comp ar ed to before .
I feel so good .
To day , I went to the ( / my ) office by c ar .
I ri d e on a train as usual .
But , it was re ally hot and hu m id e to day .
I did n ' t want to walk for a long time .
I like dr i v ing ( my c ar ) !
But , my c ar is get ting w or se because it is so old .

I want to go on a to ur of E ur o pe some time in the future .
To day , my mo m told me that in a high school in my home t ow n , there was a st ud ent s u ic id e .
S w im m ing is difficult for me al th ough I live in S o ut he a st C h in a , a place ri ch in ri ver s and la ke s .
D ur ing this s um m er va c ation , I de c id ed to le ar n it .
I have already had two s w im m ing class es from which I have le ar n ed some b as ic s w im m ing s k i ll s . With more and more p r a c t ic e , I have f al le n in l o ve with it . It can keep me f it . What ' s more , it ' s also a good way to re la x .

My mo b i le p h on e is a D o C o M o f o m a .

To day , I went to a D o C o M o sh op , _ and I to u ch ed / looked at a R e g z a p h on e .
Yes ter day my family visit ed the N ation al M us e um .
So on the s n ow turn ed into s n ow st or m .
When I push ed the b re a k p ed al , the c ar did n ' t stop p .

To day , I was ted a l ot of time wait ing .
I wait ed the ent i re morning for my comp an y ' s c ar to help me de l ive r a she l f to my c ust ome r and also wait ed for my c ust ome r to put the she l f in the s up er m ar ke t the who le after no on .
What a b or ing day this was !
but I need to w a ke up now , because the s un is already high . . . ? ?
and also it s S un day to day , , I need to go to the C h ur ch may b e la ter , , and la ter too at 3 p m . .
I am going to the B - day P ar ty of my gra d e school class m ate s it s her d aught er 1 st b - day , , and also it s been a long time since I saw her , . .
it s 9 : 3 0 in the morning here , , in s te ad of tak ing mi l k and b re a k f a st first , , I open ed first my comp ut er ha ha ha . . . w or d or d er

In H on g K on g , the go ver n ment f o c us es on the dr u g pro ble m .

However , there are no pro g r a m s to de al with you ng people ' s se x u al be ha v i o ur .
But why has this is s u e in re c ent year s been even more serious ?
The re se ar ch er s not e that `` If w ome n are ex po s ed to a b us e , do m est ic v i o l ence , and family str if e , it has end ur ing effect s . ``
A l s o there are many case s which te en age r s give up their b a b ies in the street or have an a b or tion .
The most im p or t ant thing is , they do not think they are wrong .
She w ro te a di ar y and po st ed her p re g n an c y p h ot o s on the In ter ne t .
She was pro ud of her p re g n an c y .
We have three kind s of so l u tion s to so l ve the te en age p re g n an c y pro ble m .
The second one is no n - go ver n ment and so c i al work er s . The last one is con s ul ting with other co un t ri es ' po l ic ies .
F ir st ly , go ver n ment should in ve st more in se x education .
A l s o , te en age r s feel e m b ar r as s ed co m m un ic at ing with their teachers and p ar ent s .
The ir pe er gr o up also affect s them .
F or ex amp le , their pe er gr o up may give them the wrong me s s age s regard ing & n b s p ; se x .
T e en age r s may mi s un d er st and is s u es regard ing se x when they receiv e in c or re c t i nformation from their & n b s p ; pe er gr o up .
They are c ur i ous about se x and want to try it .
S e x education re d u ce s the ra te of te en age p re g n an c y .
T e a ch er s can take care of te en age r s when teaching them s a f e se x .
A l s o , it can re d u ce their c ur i o s ity and let them le ar n the the c or re c t va l u es .
M or e o ver , ma s s me d i a give s un s u it able me s s age s to you ng people . F or ex amp le , M o ther at 1 4 ( te le v is ion dr a m a ) , My G u ar d i an C h ar a c ter s ( ch il d re n ' s co m ic b ook ) , and J un o ( F il m ) provide & n b s p ; ne g at ive me s s age s .

A l s o , it can be per ce ive d as a t re n d to follow .
So , the H on g K on g go ver n ment should set up the law so & n b s p ; as to s up er v is e the ma s s me d i a .
I do n ' t need to us e English in da i ly life .
I do n ' t have a strong reason to study English ,
I ' d like to read many b ook s from English co un t ri es in English .
What ever , I ' d like to us e English for my work .

I ' m going to C al if or n i a in this J u ly .

I ' m think ing about what to eat .
C h in e se , It al i an or In d i an f o o d .
I did not eat b re a k f a st and am very hung ry !
R i g h t now I ' m watch ing the mo v i e `` A m er ic an G i g o l o ( I do n ' t know how should I sp e ll it ) ``

In the mo v i e , he was very you ng and so fine , so c ut e !
The co ll e g e st ud ent is bu s y ^ ^ ; ( or under g r ad u ate st ud ent )
D o you think that the co ll e g e class is difficult ?
I am ma j or ing in e le c t r ical e ng in e er ing .
But it ' s t ough to keep p a ce with myself .
I was try ing to conc ent r ate on study ing for the ex a m , but the sound of c ic ad as
Besides , it was re ally hot to day .
There f or e , I de c id ed to go to the l i b r ar y and then I made a good pro g re s s .
I am now bu s y with the comp ut er ex a m in ation , which will take place this S at ur day morning .
I s c an n ed the b ook this after no on , and found that it was b or ing and not re le v ant to da i ly life .
However , as a co ll e g e school st ud ent , I have to a c c um ul ate the ne ce s s ar y c er t if ic ate s to get a good job .

It is a cha r m ing ga r d en c ity with picture s qu e scene ry and p le as ant we a ther .
S H E N Z H E N was set up as the e c on o m ic sp e c i al z on e in 1 9 8 0 .
It has de ve l op ed from a small front i er town to a mo d er n c ity , who se comp re h en s ive e c on o m ic str e ng th has led the large and middle c it ies in ch in a .
H i g h - te ch in d ust ri es are f e a ture that have con st it ut ed the first in c re as ing se ction in the e c on o m ic de ve l op ment of she n z h en .
In addition , there are about ten his t or ical and c ul t ur al re l ic s from the new stone age to M ing and Q ing d y n a st ies as well as mo d er n re v o l u tion ar y sit es in ch in a .
The ch in a f o l k c ul ture v i ll age s are show c as es of the different ar t s , c ust o m s and ar ch ite c t ur al style s . ' being from life and yet going upon to a high er p la in than life it s el f , a b s or b ing what is good and re j e c ting what is bad ' is the g u id e line for the con st r u ction of the p ar k
It ' s e as ies t to listen to English in m us ic , es pe c i ally the B e at le s and The C ar p ent er s .
( Some m us ic is im po s s i ble to listen to though ) . It ' s second e as ies t to listen to English on the ra d i o .
I of ten listen to J - w a ve in my c ar ( a H on d a F it ) .
The ra d i o person al it ies on the pro g r a m m e are very friend ly and polite , which mean s we can easily listen without get ting off en d ed , but some time s I do n ' t like their good y two sh o es at t it ud es .
A t first , I not ic ed his f a m il i ar face when I was going to bu y under w e ar at U N I Q U L O , the large st a p p ar el comp an y in J a p an , but I was n ' t con f id ent that he was my old friend .
B e c a us e I have n ' t me t him since my j un i or high school gradua tion .
I did not write da ir ies for almost a week because I was la z y . ( I am not going to say B U S Y ) My previous English t ut or told me to never us e B U S Y as the ex c us e to po st po ne something , because no matter how bu s y you are , mi ll ion s people will be bu s i er than you such as p re s id ent s , C E O s , ce le b ri t ies and a l ot of people .
I went to the C h in e se me d ic in e ho s p it al last T h u , help ed my J a p an e se friend to find a sweet room on F ri , set up the in ter ne t and went to a d ar t s b ar with him on S at , play ed be a ch v o l ly b a ll and fool ed around with some new friend s at a beautiful be a ch in the no r th T a i w an on S un day .
How do I become a b e t ter English speak er ?
It ' s just a matter of ( keep ing ) p r a c t ic e .
To day , I got a day off and went to see the c ir c us with my family .
The c ir c us has run every sea s on in this are a
from ( since ) when I was a ch il d .
I have never see n it l ive ( or `` a live perform ance `` ) because I could have see n ( see ) it on T V
A c t u ally , the live c ir c us was interest ing ,
My d aught er ' s pleasure was the be st for me from this show .
But if some on e as k s me to go again , I w o n ' t go even ( if ? ) I pay .
R e c ent ly I have been a b it la z y . . .
de c ent : H is father want ed him to get a de c ent education , so his family mo v ed from his country .
in no c ent : He tri ed to pro ve his in no c ence , but no one believe d what he said .
sen s it ive : She said her s k in is sen s it ive to every st im ul i , so she does n ' t want to go on a hi ke .
serious : I thought she was j o k ing , but when I looked at her face , it was quite serious so I re al i z ed she was tell ing the tru th .
no ble : I think every person need s something no ble in their life .
bra ve : My friend said I ' m bra ve , but I could n ' t find any bra ve qu al it ies in myself .
I wonder if the us age of `` serious `` a b o ve is c or re c t . It is ! = )
T h an k you for always writing commen t s .
I ' m ha p p y and study them .
I think that it is difficult to always think in English .
B e c a us e I want to study a b ro ad some day , I ' ll do my be st .
It is n ic e , because I can study and le ar n new w or d s .
I enjoy life every day .
I started le ar n ing e ng l ish . re c ent ly
English is very difficult to me , but I enjoy le ar n ing .
T w o di ar ies in one day .
I always write a di ar y t w ic e a day .
B e c a us e I write in K or e an and in L an g - 8 .
E ver y day . ! ! !
well , some time s I for g e t to write in k or e an .
He he - _ - ;
D ur ing sp r ing b re a k , I would go to be d around 3 a .
m and sleep ti ll 1 p . m .
The new se m est er will start next week and some of my class es will begin at 1 1 a . m .
It ' s a sh ame to let them pass me by because of over s le e p ing .
So I have been w a k ing up at 8 a .
It ' s not easy for me to w a ke up e ar ly and some time s I feel an ir re st it i ble ur g e to sleep d ur ing the day , but still I man age to get out of be d by at least 8 a .
I have an a p po in t ment to me e t my bo s s at my new job tomorrow a b it l ate at night .
I will fight to keep myself a w a ke tomorrow ! !
The pack age includ ed an electronic di ction ar y that I b or r ow ed from her a long time a g o .
I had for g ot ten to return it , but she s ud d en ly called me and asked for it to be return ed .
So I found it in my desk and she sen t it with some so u ve n ir s .
I called my mo m and let her know it was sen t by my w if e this morning .
A fter I finish ed my work , I me t a friend who is me m b er of the same English c ir c le .
She has a l ot of D V D s which at last co un t was over 2 0 0 !
I in t ro d u c ed her to L an g - 8 .
I said it was good for study ing .
Then we went for a little dr in k and had a good time talk ing .
She said she want ed to begin study ing an English ra d i o pro g r a m .
So we will study the same pro g r a m and comp ar e what we le ar n t every week .
It started ra in ing just as I got home by b ic y c le .
Yes ter day , I b ough t a great de al of ri p en ed to m at o es .
I should or , act u ally , I have to study hard this week - end , but you know , there ' s always some stuff that catch es my at ten tion more than study ing .
What is H a p p i ness ? P ar t 2
While I was listen ing to her story , I was look ing at my dinner that had already became co l d .
B o th of us were n ' t eat ing .
She some time s express ed her tea r s and s i g h ed .
A c t u ally , I listen ed to her since I could n ' t en c o ur age her .
However , I listen ed to her story s il ent ly .
A ll I could do was to gr i p her hand s .
To tell you to the tru th , I re ally want ed to hu g her , but I could n ' t because I did n ' t want to surprise her .
H u g g ing is n ' t a part of J a p an e se c ul ture .
That ' s life . : (
It is c he a p er to play now comp ar ed with before .
T h ough the or i g in s of go l f are un c le ar , it see m s that she p h er d s knock ing stone s into ra b b it ho le s is an est a b l ish ed the or y .
If it had been kept that way , it would co st nothing , right ?
A n y way , I re ally want to see T i g er play go l f .
It is ra in ing hard to day .
In J a p an , there are a l ot of ty p h o on s in S ept e m b er .
I am w or ri ed about get ting back home .
The train will probab ly have to stop .
My in ter p re ter ' s class was so t ough for me last less on .
The them e was about so c i al part ic i p ation in J a p an .
One of my class m ate s made a present ation about how J a p an is str u g g ling and f a c ing t ough e c on o m ic time s as well as po l it ical is s u es .
F or the past twenty year s , sp e c i ally middle - a g ed me n in particular have had many a b il it ies and p ri v i le g es .
They could con t ro l all of J a p an .
However they do n ' t have enough a b il it ies and public ity now .
So , we need to get a second w in d .
In the future more people who are w ome n , no n - re s id ence and you th should part ic i p ate in any so c i al mo ve ment s .
It should be better than now .
That them e felt a b st r a c t for me .
I thought she should have f o c us ed more on the conc re te de ta il s .
We are , natural ly , always look ing for the be st me th o d , the f a st est way , the e as ies t p a th to m aster ing English , J a p an e se , S p an ish , what ever ish . . .
On the other hand , good me th o d s [ As s im il ? ] when us ed wrong can pro d u ce poor re s ul t s .
In the end , what you should know , what you should [ at least you should . . . ] not ic e by your s el f is that there is n ' t A S I N G L E M E T H O D for language le ar n ing .
E a ch st ud ent has to find his own me th o d , his own way of le ar n ing .
O f course , this is n ' t an easy thing to do .
I know some things work and some do n ' t , but to find out ex a c t ly how to do it is n ' t that easy .
A ll me th o d s have good and bad point s , so what you have to do is not ic e the good point s and us e them in your own way .
O f course I ' m being a b it the at r ical , but I just want to show that there is n ' t one me th o d that r ul es over all other s .
If you work hard on it , you probab ly will not only find out which le ar n ing me th o d s and str ate g ies s u it you better , but you also will start to not ic e some un ive r s al p r in c i p le s about language le ar n ing .
The a ver age language le ar n er , who usual ly follow s just one me th o d s ( like many English teachers here in B r a z il who have t aught English us ing the same me th o d for more than 2 0 year s ) , will probab ly not le ar n the se p r in c i p le s and , there f or e , become kind of limit ed when it come s to how to le ar n a language .
We had a very good time play ing a cha s ing game in the water .
I ' m very ha p p y to see that my d aught er started to have more con f id ence in the water because she could n ' t put her face in the water before she went to s w im m ing less on s .
She was even s c ar ed of get ting a sp l ash on her face when she had a show er .
No w she can do a head st and in the water !
As her school will have s w im m ing less on s start ing soon , ho pe ful ly she will have no pro ble m in the water and can enjoy s w im m ing with other s .

In addition to that , I felt re ally tired after get ting out of the water al th ough I had n ' t s w um much .

Then , something happen ed .
S ud d en ly `` this fellow `` pass ed by me quick ly !

A fter a f e w minute s , I was able to re g a in my c al m .

It was the sp on g e ' s ( p and a ' s ) le g .
I some h ow laugh ed .

A fter that , it was back to normal .
No w , it watch es me from the desk .
What a f e ar ful story that was ! !
It is difficult for me to speak and write in English .
And let ' s tell own language to each other ! !
My think ing has come to a stand st i ll .
I have no idea s .
So , there is nothing and nothing again .
Where did my in s p ir ation go ?
I tra ve led with my class 3 days a g o .
A l th ough we were tired every body felt please d .
We took many p h ot o s ; about 7 0 0 .
we went to an is l and , it s name is T h un g N a i and it is a new to ur is t sp ot .
P e op le who live there are friend ly , it has fresh a ir and many f r u it tree s .
A fter this j o ur ne y I understand my friend s better and l o ve them so much .
I think they feel the same way .
To day in Y o k o ha m a it was ra in y , though I had ful f il led my p l an in my previous j o ur n al .
The he a v y feel ing of my body was re l i e v ed by in d o or c l im b ing ex er c is e .
A fter w ar d s , my p al m s k in pe el ed and I could hard ly mo ve my tired body .
But I ' ll have a good night ' s sleep .
I must fight the feel ing of not want ing to go to my office .
I gue s s I ' ll s u f f er m us c le a ch e tomorrow morning .
I ' ve read The S ch e m e T e a m , the 5 th b ook in the C he st n ut H i ll S er ies .
The C he st n ut H i ll S er ies is written by L a ur en B r ook e .
They are 7 th gra d er students in a boarding school for girl s called C he st n ut H i ll .
The school has good ho r se ri d ing pro g r a m s as well as education al pro g r a m s .
They face some difficult ies .
But in each case , they help each other to over c ome the se difficult ies .
In this s er ies , the re l ation s h i p with ho r se s is n ' t so much the ma in to p ic of the story , comp ar ed to the He ar t l and S er ies .
S t i ll the her o in es ' de v o tion to ho r se s is pro m in ent in the story .
The in ter v i e w er s asked us [ 1 8 in ter v i e w e es includ ing me ] to come up with an idea of a new pro d u c t and the mar ke ting str ate g y to make it out st and ing .
I was re ally surprise d but not n er v ous because I take In ter n ation al B us i ness M an age ment at the un ive r s ity .
There had been two in ter v i e w s before I got the in ter n s h i p pro g r a m .
M or e o ver , one of the new e m p l o y e es who had just come to work only two week s before told me to finish his work of a 1 9 p age translation with in 2 week s .
And to comp o se 1 7 English v o c a b ul ar y po e m s for a S A T course .
I was and still am in f ur i at ed with the way they treat an in ter n s h i p st ud ent .
I get only 1 0 0 B a h t per day , which is about 3 do ll ar s a day !
My so n
It ' s been two days since I re g is ter ed at this sit e
What a great sit e !
A n y way , I have a one - year - old bo y .
He c a n ' t talk at all yet , but he always say s `` O h ! `` .
When ever he find s something ( a do g , a light , a but t on , e t c . . . ) , he say s `` O h ! `` .
He dis c o ver s something every day like an in v ent or .
I w o ke up f e w minute s a g o .
I have a meeting to day , so there work that I have to do .
I ' m re ally l ate .
A F i re w or k D is p la y !
I went to a f i re w or k d is p la y on A u g ust 7 .
It was he l d near the sea at my home t ow n .
A bout ten th ous and of f i re w or k s were set off .
I went there we ar n ing a y u k at a with my friend s .
B o th of them were de l ic i ous !
A fter that , I watch ed the f i re w or k s .
They were wonder ful and I was ex cited ! !
H a ve you ever see n the mo v i e `` This is it `` ?
In J a p an , the mo v i e got to No . 1 on a week ly mo v i e cha r t .
A l ot of my friend s have see n `` This is it `` and all of them have been ent h us i a st ic about M ic he al J a c k s on .
I ' ve also been a M ic ha el J a c k s on f an at ic since I was a te en age r , but I c a n ' t go see the mo v i e because I have to take care of my two you ng ch il d re n with my w if e . . .
B T W , I can do the dance s in M ic he al J a c k s on ' s m us ic v id e o s , like `` T h ri ll er , `` `` B i ll i e J e an , `` and `` S m o o th C ri m in al `` .
I will tea ch the dance of `` T h ri ll er `` to my friend who is a dance c l u b me m b er .
I made a G M , which appear s in J a p an e se an im ation `` M o b i le S u it G un d a m . `` I like this ro b ot .
It is also f un to pai n t different ly from the original ver s ion .
Yes ter day , I sub m it ted my gradua tion the s is .
I thought that sub m it ting it was the same as the c er t if ic ation of my gradua tion since my the s is was already c he c k ed by my p rofessor .
But in fact , I understood that in M ar ch I have to take an or al ex a m in ation .
I ' m a little dis a p po in ted with this .
I had p l an n ed how to sp en d my ho l i day . . .
The days I have to study will con t in u e . .
J P are too n er v ous to s ur v ive !
and let them go a b ro ad for one year or so ! !
I sympath i z e with that way of think ing ,
I part ic i p at ed in a train ing works h op for sp or t s or th op ed ic s .
E a ch do c t or spoke about `` k ne e pro ble m s `` .
The con t ent of the speech es interest ed me .
I was es pe c i ally interest ed in the speech about `` mo ve ment of an a ly s is `` .
may b e I c aught a co l d : (
I think that may b e I c aught a co l d .
U s u ally I ' m the one who always comp la in s about the a ir - condition er in my office .
I always feel hot and I always shout `` It ' s too hot `` at my co ll e a gue s , but now I have to turn off the a ir - condition er .
I sit near the w in d ow so it ' s the hot t est place in the room but now al th ough the s k y is full of s un s h in e and all the he at is coming through the w in d ow I do n ' t feel any w ar m er .
I have to take some me d ic in e first before a re al co l d catch es me ( ^ _ _ ^ )
This is my first time writing an ar t ic le us ing English !
I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent in J a p an !
I like b a k ing sweet s , going on tri p s , listen ing to m us ic , and play ing in st r u ment s .
I can play a g u it ar and a p i an o .
And I l o ve J a p an e se c ul ture so I am le ar n ing about the J a p an e se tea ce re m on y .
I want to work in a for e i g n country in the future : )
I ' m a st ud ent of the de p ar t ment of history . However , I must le ar n more than that . S u ch as in ter n ation al re l ation s , English , and J a p an e se .
E ver y day , I study those four as pe c t s from 7 : 0 0 to 2 2 : 0 0 .
And I always have no time to do any other s .
some on e told me I must speak English very well .
I need friend and I need people to be con t ent with me . However , people do n ' t like me . A t le a st this is what I think .
who can help me or tell me what can I do ?
My A n x i e ty
He had se c re t ly s m o k ed with his friend s .
H is teacher came to our house .
He told me what had happen ed .
This is the first time that I have heard of their mi s b e ha v i or .
I thought my so n want ed to es c a pe from being for c ed to study by me .
I re f le c ted on myself a l ot and said to him ,
`` You do not have to study so much , so you should stay home . ``
I have heard the sound of them walk ing on the ro o f .
One day I heard a voice in his room so I open ed the do or to his room .
Then , I saw two bo y s hi d ing behind the bu n k be d .
I as s er ted to them about a f e w things .
I am sorry that you do not keep the pro m is es you made with me about not s m o k ing and study ing hard er .
What should I do ?
This is my first time to us e this sit e .
So I would like to co m m un ic ate with who ever want s to ( speak with me ) .
I ten d to believe in g h o st s because I was b or n in small town .
The p op ul ation of my town was l ow .
My ne i g h b or ' s house was old so it was easily b ro k en when a ty p h o on come s to our re g ion .
B e f or e I tri ed to sleep at night , I always went to the re st ro o m where I can see their house .
I could n ' t do anything because I was a kid .
I called my mo m : `` He y , I found a c ock ro a ch so please k i ll them . ``
`` co m ' on mo m ! ``
`` hu r ry up ! ``
I of ten us ed something like that .
My high school year s ( 4 )
They ent er tain ed me near ly through all of gra d e 2 .
O f course , I was w or ri ed about my be ha v i or when I was found enjoy ing them .
They f in ally found out .
I was s us p en d ed to make a s el f - ex a m in ation . ?
A t the begin n ing , though , I found that I could not catch up with my less on s , for I had mi s s ed so many less on s .
B e c a us e of this , it took me four year s to finish the three - year j un i or high school .
She like s the new ho s p it al because the do c t or explain s to her well .
It ' s at a very easy le ve l .
I heard it ' s good to read many b ook s in a s u it able le ve l .
No w , the number of w or d s I can read is 2 666 w or d s .
5 th g en er ation i P o d n an o
I b ough t a 5 th g en er ation i P o d n an o last D e ce m b er .
So it is not easy for me to us e A p p le pro d u c t s .
I can im p or t m us ic into my i P o d n an o but c a n ' t understand the way to im p or t any picture s .
F in ally , to day , I found out how to im p or t some picture s into it !
I am very ha p p y about being able to do that .
I had a very bu s y day to day . I had two class es , c he c k ed students ' not e b ook s and there was a business tri p .
I was going to go to con ver s ation al English class , but the English teacher c aught a co l d yesterday , so to day ' s less on was c ance led .
I went to a M e x ic an re st a ur ant , `` E l To ri t o `` to night and at e E n ch il ad a , S al s a ch i p s , C e as er s al ad , and ic e c re a m and dr an k a M ar g ar it a which was f ro z en with a s al t f r ing e around the g la s s .
I like M ar g ar it as very much , but it s al c o h o l le ve l is kind of high , so I ' m always get ting sleep y after dr in k ing .
There are many t v s c re en s ha ng ing on the wall and the t v cha n n el is always sp or t s cha n n el `` E S P N . `` To day ' s sp or t was b a se b a ll .
f o ot b a ll sea s on will start in A u g ust . . . . .
so now all that we can watch is b a se b a ll game s and ho c ke y game s .
To day is G u y F a w ke s N i g h t ( or bo n f i re night ) in O x f or d .
A l th ough it is off ic i ally the f if th of No ve m b er , the even t is to be he l d S at ur day night this year .
L a st year my w if e and I went to the bo n f i re he l d at So u th P ar k .
A l th ough it was a co l d night , the large p ar k was full of people .
G u y F a w ke s tri ed to blow up P ar l i a ment in or d er to k i ll K ing J ame s I of E ng l and and V I of S c ot l and , but f a il ed and was ar re st ed on the f if th of No ve m b er in 1 6 0 5 .
The f a il ed as s as s in ation attempt is now know n as the g un p ow d er p l ot .
F or some reason , the B ri t ish have been ce le b r at ing this day with a bo n f i re and f i re w or k s for more than 4 0 0 year s .
I ' m not even sure that the B ri t ish are in f a v o ur of or are against G u y F a w ke s himself and his p l ot .
In my opinion , most of them may be tak ing a d v ant age of his f a il ed attempt as a reason / ex c us e to enjoy f i re w or k s .
F or me as a J a p an e se , f i re w or k s on a co l d a ut um n night are very un us u al and is quite a s ur re al ex pe ri ence , since f i re w or k s are ic on s of the hot t est s um m er sea s on in J a p an , re m in d ing me the hu m id ity and hot a ir , girl s we ar ing y u k at a ( by the way , girl s with y u k at a look 3 0 % more at t r a c t ive and p re t t i er than usual ) , k a k i g or i ( c r us h ed ic e with f r u it - f la v o ur ed s y r up ) , and so on .
When a B ri t ish `` guy `` visit s J a p an and see f i re w or k s f est i v al s in s um m er , what would he think / how would he feel ?
D r ow s i ness
I stay ed up all night last night , and so I am ter ri b ly sleep y to day .
However , I do it any way .
B e c a us e dr ow s i ness ha r m s study , it is ne ce s s ar y to take care .
In most school s in J a p an there is va c ation d ur ing s um m er .
But I must go to school tomorrow .
O ur school start s va c ation at the end of this week .
I am look ing for w ar d to it very much .
P a c k er s v . s . F al c on s
One of the di v is ion play - off s is `` P a c k er s v . s . F al c on s `` .
The F al c on s have be a ten the P a c k er s this sea s on .
This c l i p tell s me that the next game will be too close to call .
This mo v i e ' s or i g in is the gra p h ic no ve l `` W A T C H M E N `` , written by A l an M o or e , i ll ust r at ed by D a ve G i b b on s .
I can say , `` W A T C H M E N `` cha ll e ng es the read er ' s mind .
What is e v il ?
What is just ic e ?
What is hu man ity ?
We can be all ow ed to s a c ri f ic e some on e to s a ve the world ?
I ' ve had no time to write on L an g - 8 .
I ' m writing on L an g - 8 for the first time in a month .
I went to S h i g a p re f e c ture last week , and stay ed at B i w a k o H ot el be s id e a la ke .
A t night , I watch ed the ha r ve st mo on .
I comp le te ly for g ot about a l ot of work .
Then he begin s c l im b ing the s ta ir s .
I study English almost every day .
But I ' m not good at English .
There f or e , I want to le ar n to read , write and speak English .
B y the way , I have a T w it ter account .
I went out to a Ya k it or i re st a ur ant with my co ll e gue after work last night .
It was so hot d ur ing the day , so I want ed to go to a re st a ur ant in which a ir condition ing works .
When we stood in front of the do or of that re st a ur ant , we found the do or was open .
I had a feel ing that what I did n ' t ho pe for would now happen .
D u e to the hot at m o s p he re I could dr in k much more be er .
I felt more co m f or t able as w in d some time s ble w into the re st a ur ant .
As you might know , the Ya k it or i is a p op ul ar J a p an e se f o o d .
It is made from s ever al b ite - s i z ed piece s of ch ic k en me at , or ch ic k en off al , s ke w er ed on a B a m b o o s ke w er and b ar b e c u ed .
It is serve d with s al t or with `` T ar e `` s a u ce , which is g en er ally made up of mi r in , s a ke , so y s a u ce and s u g ar .
Yes ter day I went to a f a m ous for t un e tell er .
She is in H ar a j u ku Tokyo and is called `` M o ther of H ar a j u ku `` .
I always in qu i re about my job , my mar ri age and my he al th .
She said that I ' ll me e t my de st in ed woman next sp r ing ! !
I ' m look ing for w ar d to meeting her .
I just have a question :
How do you say T O and F R O M in J a p an e se
O r when you give a g if t ?
I write in my di ar y on L an g - 8 in English for the first time .
So , I try to write in my di ar y to le ar n how to us e English .
I write in my di ar y every day as much as I can / as much as possible .
To day , I went to a re st a ur ant to eat o k on o m i y a k i with my friend s .
I could eat as much as I want ed .
However , I at e too much and have a so re st o m a ch .
I ' m study ing the im m un e s y s te m now .
I will explain about my re se ar ch in more de ta il some day .
I pass ed the qu al if ic ation ex a m , `` E i k en , P re - one gra d e `` a f e w month s a g o .
a p p l ic ant s , so I think that is why they ' re going to hold this s amp le t est .
In the se month s , I have not been a di l i g ent st ud ent .
I ' m always bu s y the se days !
The se days I ' m always bu s y because school has started .
S in ce school started , I do n ' t have much time to do anything I want to do .
U n f or t un ate ly , the only thing that I have time for is study ing , study ing , and more study ing .
We are all going c r a z y now .
This year my teachers are funny . A l s o , I have j o in ed a mo d er n dr a m a c l u b .
D r a m a c l u b is funny and ex c it ing .
My new life , is full of ha p p i ness and f un time s .
But my life is also full of p re s s ur e .
So , I need to study hard now .
I b ough t some st ock s last O c t .
S in ce then , I ' ve been re ally interest ed in e c on o m ic s .
The e c on o m ic s in J a p an is easily affect e ed by that of for e i g n co un t ri es ( es pe c i ally U S ) .
O f course not only J a p an , many co un t ri es ' e c on o m ic s are affect ed by other co un t ri es ' e c on o m ic s .
No w , in my country , many people were f ir ed , and what is w or se , it ' s difficult for any on e to find new job .
There ' s al ot of bad new s like this now . . .
However , do n ' t you think the re l ation s h i p of e c on o m ic s between one country and another is interest ing ?
I think it ' s still too e ar ly for me to talk about e c on o m ic s in English .
S in ce I ' d like to know about the se place s as much as possible , I am read ing g u id e b ook s and c he c k ing the in ter ne t every day .
I H a ve B e c ome A w ar e
R e c ent ly , I ' ve become a w ar e that it ' s not easy to e ar n money .
We never e ar n money at the time of work ing .
M a y b e there are some job s that can get l ot s of money a day .
But I do n ' t think they are a b s o l ut e ly good job s .
H a ve a n ic e day ! !
It is a n ic e we a ther to day !
I like such a day .
I had only a class on man age ment to day . It was b or ing ,
It mean s that the f in al - ex a m s are coming soon .
M a y b e I go n n a turn c r a z y . . . . .
But I am not in the mo o d to study . . . . I am so la z y . . . . . .
B y the way I am about to leave for home
To day my co ll e g e will hold an even t ! I think it will be f un !
This even t is he l d once a year .
I could me e t a l ot of friend s ! I am very ex cited !
This story sha ll con t in u e la ter . . . . . . . .
I c ook ed two ha m b ur g er dis he s yesterday .
I was going to play ten n is in the after no on .
But what make s the se two v id e o s to t ally different ?
When the s un sh in es , I will hold your hand and to g e ther we will walk along the street s .
To day I ' d like to tell a story about a dr un k who los t his ke y s .
It ' s a f a m ous j o ke , so you may have heard it
I think it is a simple story but it tea ch es us im p or t ant less on about our life .
One night , a man go es out to dr in k at a l o c al b ar .
A fter saying good b y e to his friend s , he begin s walk ing home , s ing ing ha p p i ly
As he is get ting close to his a p ar t ment , he take s his ke y s out of his pocket but dr op s them on the gr ound in the dark .
On ce he re al i z es his ke y s are mi s s ing , he w and er s around a street l amp and begin s look ing for them
I had a trouble with my English .
T h ough I have been le ar n ing English for a long time .
I knew my pro ble m was that I c ound ' t catch the mean ing what people had said , and my pro n un c i ation was too bad .
I want ed to be able to m aster English con ver s ation , but I sp ent most of the time study ing gra m m ar and even I tri ed to read new s p a p er and no ve l s .
A ll study are help ful , but some of them are not effect ive .
It is im p or t ant for me to know what I want and f o c us on it .
