A family , seemingly a father , a mother and two of their children , get in a car .
Funky music starts , playing some bad obscenities .
It seems they do n't care so much about its lyrics and ride on to the rhythm .
This commercial film is really reflecting what happens to English learners .
Characters of the seasons are completely different from each other in Japan .
In spring , we can see not only plums and cherry blossoms , but also a trailing mist across mountains which is a crowning beauty in the morning .
In summer , if you go to the countryside , many fireflies will welcome you .
It must be a fantastic scene .
In autumn , especialy late autmn , when you look at the reeds flashing ( ? ) golden and the leaves turning red or yellow , you will surely feel happy , as if you were dreaming .
In winter , silent snow indicates great intelligence ( / wisdom ) which man can not have .
In response to the question as to which season I like , it must be the time of seasonal change .
I miss passing seasons with affection , while I admire coming seasons .
Japanese value evanescence .
The beauty of the cherry blossom is not so much in its appearance , but its evanescence .
The life of a firefly is very short .
I wanna learn Japanese but I 'm so busy and I ca n't type Japanese on this PC in the coming weeks .
I like it here , so does Kichan
It tasted very good ! !
It takes two hours to commute to work to and fro .
I take a subway to work and change trains twice .
I study my English books in the train .
Usually , we use them only when we go far away .
Today I needed to go to the post office to pick up a letter from Japan .
I used a highway just to go to the post office .
I think my Japanese friends would never believe this .
Japan won against Argentina ! I 'm so excited !
But I could n't see the game .
Do you know about MANGA cafes ?
Does anyone know about Manga cafes ?
A Manga cafe is where you can read many many Manga .
In the Manga cafes they give us separate rooms .
Their prices are low so many generations can use them .
If you come to Japan and your are good at Japanese , I suggest going a Manga cafe .
By the way , Manga cafes have many different surroundings .
They have good surroundings .
In IKEBUKURO , KITITYOUZI , SIBUYA have good one . ( ? )
Thank you for reading ^ ^
It is the first time I 've [ I have ] come here .
Hello ! !
Yesterday , I went drinking with my friends from when I was college student .
One of them is working for a Japanese automaker .
Sometimes he goes around the world .
enjot it ! I 'm enjoying it !
I decided to read aloud using the AFN book .
The first section was the inaugural address of Barack Obama as the nation 's 44th president .
Usually I carry my I - pod to listen to some music and English programs .
Today I found out a new thing about English .
The sentence is ( space ) `` I can not thank you enough ``
I felt this sentence sounded like that person is n't grateful .
Yeah I learned today one thing today .
I put a fish , which was his favourite food , on his grave .
I can think of nothing , because I am tired now , or just pretending to be tired now .
What I am doing now looks like nothing , but it 's ( ? ) coming from nowhere , or it is just that I have to think more to find out what is needed .
I have trouble with my studies , livelihood and my girlfriend ( who may leave soon )
I went to a cafe near my school to read books and I walked for a long time .
Honestly I need to challenge my German .
But it does n't mean that I 'm giving up .
There are a lot of students from various countries .
England , Italy , Austria , Slovakia , Serbia etc .
Since this was my first time meeting Slovakian and Serbian people ,
Almost all conversation was in English , but I would have to say I had much difficulty communicating with them .
My communication skill in English is not good enough , particularly for listening .
In addition to that , everybody had a different accent in English including me .
So they tried to memorize it by associating it with `` Hiroshima ( Japanese city ) ``
It sounds funny , I never hit upon such an idea .
But I think Hiroshi is easier than Hiroshima , because it 's shorter , is n't it ?
Nice to meet u ~ ~ I 'm a freshman here ~ ~ I was born in Chengdu , China .
I hope I can make friends with you ~ ~
I hope everyone has a nice day ~ ~
Thank you ~ ~ ~ ~
When I happend to walk by the front of a kimono shop , a cute young clerk wearing kimono talked to me whilst smiling .
Some pretty girls wearing kimono were in Kyoto or Universal Studio Japan in Osaka on the pictures .
We talked about kimonos and things for a long time .
The clerk said , `` If you have time , why do n't you try this on ? ``
Of corse I tried it .
I had enough time and I do n't have any kimonos instead of yukata .
The kimono which I tried on was really beautiful .
I was satisfied with trying it on and had fun talking with the clerk .
But Kimono 's are very expensive , I ca n't afford to buy it now .
It seems that today will be a really nice day .
There are n't any clouds in the sky . The sun is shining and there is no wind .
Also , it is3 degrees Celsius , but it isonly11 a . m . Today I 'm going to play basketball in the skate park .
By the way , in the NBA , theOklahoma City Thunders wonversus L .
Lakers and arenow 2 - 2 in theseries .
m EST time , Cleveland will play versus Chicago .
I hope theCavaliers will win .
It like the spring had come already here in Chubu area , the center of Japan .
This is a quick digression , and the headquarters of hot TOYOTA is here .
And yesterday was my pay day , so I withdrew some money from ATM .
But it took me no less than 100 yen to withdraw some money as it was on saturday .
you see , just to withdraw money !
The banks are so budget - minded . Why should I pay money to withdraw my money ?
What do you think about it ?
Though I make fuss over it , I take out my money on weekends .
By the way , I walked to the convience store on foot since it 's so close .
I could see many spring flowers out there , and I was able to feel spring is actually around the corner .
I looked up other words to mean warm and found `` as snug as a bug in a rug `` .
I found it isvery interesting .
My name is Phyten !
I am a student in Hitotsubashi University , and my major is economics .
( Here is a list of my hobbies . . . )
Playing guitar , reading books ( especially on business and finance ) , playing badminton , surfing the Internet , programming , and talking ( chatting ) with my friends !
Also we can play with our neighbors . Not only we can make good friends but also we can spend quality time together .
Maybe I guess there is a saying , `` There will be fortunes to people who do nice things for their neighbors . `` .
If we share the foods to our neighbors when they are becoming poor , then we can get some food from them when they become okay and I become poor .
Next , we should act in a polite and positive manner towards our neighbors .
Neighbors are the part of our life and society , and all people like the neighbors who are very nice .
We should be friendly , helpful , and act in a suitable manner if we want to become a nice neighbors .
I 've finished my work .
I fixed some program code .
On this line ' Ninja ' trains - trains withninjas ' facespainted on - run every day .
But the train I 'm taking is not a ' Ninja ' train .
It does n't mean I got lost but that I lost my bank card .
Till recently , I was always absent - minded for some reason .
I kept thinking about things while walking on the road or siting in the train .
After I found out that the card was not in the right place .
I emptied my bag and anxiously checked it 3 ( three ) times . with .
But I still could n't find it .
Then , I called my family to let them . report the loss to the bank immediately .
I ca n't do that any more .
But what can I do ?
I just got home , recently I 've been getting back home late because of my job .
I really want to say thank you to everyone who corrected my mistakes and sent me a message .
I am now exchange student in America , and this is the first time I have ever lived without my family , so my parents worried a lot when I said goodbye to them at the airport .
But I reassured them by saying that I would send emails .
At first glance , my roommate actually left a very good impression on me because she was 5 years older than me , which made me feel she would support me in so many ways .
When I arrived at my room , she was with her Japanese boyfriend , so she introduced him to me and told me that if I had any Japanese questions , I could just ask her boyfriend .
I felt that I was so lucky that God gave me such a nice roommate , because she seemed to be very protective .
For a girl who had left home for the first time , it really helped a lot ! !
At least , she gave a made me feel secure , though her boyfriend always stayed in our room even at the bed time .
To let my roommate know that I would not be a threat to her relationship , I only brought up my questions when she was there as well .
Therefore , she hoped that I could turn to other Japanese for help instead .
As a result , I wrote a note to her , apologized and made it clear that I did not mean to upset her .
If she felt hurt , I would stop doing it right away ! !
Even though her boyfriend told me that he felt his girlfriend was too emotional and that I could still consult him questions when she was away , I declined his kindness and hardly spoke to him .
Originally I thought that everything would just go back to normal , to the very beginning when I was on good terms with her .
However I was totally wrong because now she only gives me the cold shoulder .
Last time , I fuzzed every time as speaking more than usual .
Sounds ironic , does n't it ?
What I mean is the more I study about expressions or vocabularies , the more I 'm confused , because everytime I try to use new things , it does n't come to my mind as automatically as I wish , and it makes me murmur ( ? ) .
It 's because I have a school trip on September 7 - 9 .
Although I live in Fukushima in Japan , I 'll be going to Tokyo in Japan . ( Future Tense )
So I need to be ready for my school trip soon .
I 'll write about my school trip when I get back home .
This leads to nowhere .
I want to try myself against the material world .
Our turn is at 14 : 25 .
I 'm going to my university , and starting choir practice from now on .
I live in a dorm with an international student from the U .
She is very good at Japanese and always helps me study English .
However , because she speaks Japanese so well , I sometimes hesitate to speak English .
Moreover , she always speaks Japanese instead of using English , so I do n't have enough chances to speak English .
Therefore , I try to decide `` ONLY ENGLISH DAY `` and I ask her to speak only English during that day !
I 'd go back in time , if I could : (
Annzu was a stray cat and was pecked by crows in a park , before a volunteer saved her life .
When she came to my house for the first time , she was so skinny that we could n't hug her tightly .
Today , I begin lang - 8
I 've been studying English since I was a junior high school student .
I can understand wrriten Emglish , for example news papers ,
but I ca n't listen and write English .
The class consists of students and teachers .
I had to speak many times , so it was profitable .
Gossip Girl is a popular American TV series that was introduced to China as a fashion and life style book .
In the shows , Serana and Blair are the most lucky girls who are rich , beautiful , charming , and so on .
They possess all the things which was most girls want to have in the world over all .
The people in the upper east live in a gorgeous and lavish area , plus they are elite who know how to managemultinational corporations even though maybe inherited them from family .
Obviously , they are in the spotlight in any parties at New York they go to at night .
We are mortal , directly I envy that kind of bule ( ? ) blood people .
Let me cite a fashionable word `` hold `` which is fantasy of an amazing girl in China .
I want to go to NY someday .
One of the serious problems in Japan .
I watched a TV news broadcast which was about the high numbers of suicide among younger people around 20 to 30 years old .
The news said that the numbers have continue to increase over the last 10 years .
I think that most younger people in Japan have no dreams or purpose for the future .
Then they feel themselves as useless to the world and that they have no reason to live anymore .
Anyway , presently , we are much richer materially than we have been in past , but our minds have weakened .
And Japanese society is in aging society . We are running out of younger people in the work force .
Somehow we must stop younger people from committing suicide , or our society will collapse much sooner than we expected .
I went to Oita , my home town , for about three weeks for summer vacation , and I came back home three days ago .
I felt a fresh appreciation of my parents this time because of going back to my home town .
I also realized how I had always had a luxurious life .
I did n't feel lonely before I went back to Oita , but still if I go back once , I will get accustomed to my old life with dogs , a sister and parents , so when I am alone again , I will feel very lonely .
But in fact , I 'm know that it is too bad for me because I 'm going abroad to America for four years as a university studdent .
None of my friends lives near my house , so whenever I go shopping , I am alone .
It is only a matter of time now before I start my class ( again ) , so I 'm looking forward to seeing my friends now .
This happened a few months ago .
I was on the platform , waiting for a train , as usual .
She seemed to be over 50 years - old , and came near to
where I was standing , because there was public phone near me .
She put money into phone , then dialed .
`` Oh , I 'm sorry I 'm going to be late . `` the woman said in a loud voice that
She continued talking .
`` I was having a poo . ( lol . . )
It was really big one so it took a long time to flush . ``
That 's why I missed the train .
I 'm sorry I ca n't be there on time , but it could n't be flushed ``
She desperately explained that it was n't her fault , but her poos fault .
Sometimes people make excuses for their mistakes , such as tardiness
However , I have never heard such a childish excuse .
Otherwise , nobody will believe her .
Everyday , going to the office , I watch a video on my iPod touch .
Recently I 've been watching `` Sesame Street ``
for the purpose of studying English .
`` Sesame street `` is fun for me .
But it 's exciting story tires me sometimes .
The word ' excitement ' means `` Hi - tensyon `` -
Maybe it is bad English .
`` sesame street `` is useful for studying english .
about `` less exciting `` English studying videos .
I had a dream that I drove a car and it fell off from the road .
I had to lie down before I checked the e - mail yesterday .
So , maybe I think I might have an allergy to pollen .
In spring I get dry skin and my eyes become very itchy . . .
Studying English
Hello , everyone .
My name is KAORI and I live in Japan Osaka .
I had studied English while I was a student , but I ca n't understand English now .
This trauma is very heavy to me .
So , I decided to start studying English at this site .
Please teach me the correct English .
So recently I have not updated my diary .
I work in a trading company .
We receive telephone calls from abroad , take care of foreign customer who visits Japan , go on business trips to do research at various conferences and exhibitions .
I believe someday I will improve my English if I keep on studying and updating ( my diary on ) this website .
Wow . . what a good website this is !
This is my first time writing here .
I want to meet many people from other countries !
I 'm very interested in classical guitar , but I ca n't play well .
After I graduate from college , I would play the guitar freely ! !
Tonight the World cup Japan vs Paraguay game is on !
I want to support the Japanese team , but I have to go to my part - time job . . . .
DVD shop have many dvds : 24 , prison brake , ugly betty , gossip girl , fringe , and so on . . .
What is your recommendation ?
The Japanese government warned people that there was a possibility of electric power failure in the Kanto region yesterday afternoon .
Tokyo power company had already stopped their service in the scheduled area
but they said there was still not enough power .
I filled plastic bottles , pots and buckets with as much water as possible .
We ca n't use water if we have a power failure .
My apartment is serving water to each family with electric power .
Fortunately , we avoided the crisis , although all the ATMs temporarily did n't work at one major Japanese bank .
The Fall approaches .
It was rainning day . It was raining today
The weather in Korea is a little cold due to the change of seasons .
For that reason , I thought about a lot of things .
So , now I 'm mentally overloaded .
I should do something fun !
Yesterday , I hung out to relax .
I walked from Shibuya to Harajuku and returned to Shibuya .
It was a nice weather , so I felt well .
It was a happy day , because I went to a spot I never go .
I forgot what I wanted to write about today .
My cellphone was n't working well .
I thought my cellphone finally broke down , because it did n't react even after I pressed the buttons .
I almost lost my composure .
I noticed that my friend 's cellphone is the same type as mine .
He was studying , but I broke in because I did n't afford to care for him .
He told me some information about the cellphone and suggested that I call customer service .
After he had finished his story , I tried to call customer service .
The moment I called to the customer center , I noticed that I was using my cellphone and it was working as usual .
I think it is because of my aging .
Every time I write an essay , I use a lot of the same transitional words .
If you know a variety of transitional words , could you please let me know ?
I have had lots of work to do , but I need to keep my learning time somehow .
It 's difficult for me to do two things at the same time .
But I 'll try hard , hoping that I can keep up at least once a week .
I want to be an international translation volunteer .
So maybe I should practice English often , hoping that Lang - 8 will help .
Outside was too hot , so I went home early and stayed in the living room .
The reason why is that the living room is the only room that has an air conditioner .
I live in Saint Petersburg near the metro station `` Ploshad Mygestva `` .
This station is not situated in the center of the city , but I very often go to the center to walk on the beautiful streets .
Many of St Petersburg 's streets still have some special historical features .
Little courtyards , narrow streets and buildings from the 19th century surround you and can immerse you in this fantastic time .
And a lot of cars , shops and coffee houses ca n't break this illusion .
You can walk in this city for many days and every day you will discover some new details of this atmosphere for youself .
Many times I just walk on `` Nevsky prospect `` and go to Aleksander Nevsky square .
Sometimes when I 'm not in a hurry , I just turn right or left at random crossroads and aimlessly walk around the little streets to feel the unique atmosphere .
If you are ever in Saint Petersburg and you have a lot of free time , I advise you to just walk around the city for one or two hours without any plan , and you will feel the unique atmosphere of the 19th century .
I was surprised at / by how big they were .
I thought that these cucumbers were more than twice as large as ones in Japan .
I recognized that even the same vegetables can have / be different shapes .
I began using Lang - 8 today .
I 'm not good at English , therefore I think that I should write short sentences every day .
This is my first time writing a diary .
I 'm Japanese . I 'm 21 years old .
My name means cherry blossoms , which is the most popular flower in japan .
I live in Kanagawa prefecture which is near Tokyo .
I 'm learning about ' Environment and Humanity ' in my University .
My hobbies are dancing , listening to hip - hop music and going to museums .
In March I 'm going to go to Colorado State University in the USA .
If you find any errors , please correct them .
My year end result will come out this Thursday .
I feel pretty anxious waiting for this day .
I hope to pass with flying colours !
Even though I try to write short entries , I regret that nobody corrected yesterday 's entry . . .
You do you think I should do to get corrections ?
Please give me some advice on how to get more corrections .
Would you please correct the entry I made yesterday ?
Yesterday I went to a hot spring and the bookstore .
The hot spring was very good .
At the bookstore I bought a textbook on English proficiency .
Someday I want to be proficient in English .
I went to school before going to the hot springs and book store .
It was to meet with fellow teachers .
I made cheesecake and delivered it to the fellow who had to work .
( * The second picture is a view of the nearby hot springs . )
Math is a very important subject in Korea .
If you give up on this subject , you give up on college .
But I am really poor in math .
I ca n't understand ( it ) at all .
Whenever I try to solve a question , I just get stuck .
How I can get better at math ?
so I decided to send a present for her today !
She likes to eat Japanese snacks so I decided to send her a plenty of Japanese snacks .
Most of it are rice crackers in different tastes .
I can not see the end of the tunnel .
I can not go back , and all I can do is to go forward while touching the wall of the tunnel .
I sometimes experience fear , depression and loneliness , but I have to conquer them if I want to become a fluent English speaker .
I almost lose my confidence of whether I can do it or not . . . . . .
It was too cold to use my room today .
The heater in my room is not warm enough , so I decided using my laptop in my living room .
According to the weather news , this cold weather will last until tomorrow .
I wonder if I 'll use my room tomorrow .
I do n't like to go out during a long holiday , everywhere is crowded with car and people .
It 's not easy to go for a few meters in a traffic jam .
Most of Chiang Mai residents will stay at home for celebration with families , while the visitors from around the world choose to countdown on the street .
Have you seen any accidents on the street in this season ?
After the celebrations finish , the drunken drivers need to go back home , but they always lost their control in driving .
During this festival we wish there was less disaster or loss .
The police station has a service to provide a cup of coffee or a foot massage for a long distance driver .
We have only a small hope that there will be less loss than last year .
Our long holiday lasts from 31st Dec 2009 to 3rd Jan 2010 including the beginning and finishing day . It 's six days in total .
Lately , I spend a lot of my time on the computer .
The reason is that it is on my table .
When I start using the computer I go mad with the internet .
But I cure that now using this program :
This program shows how much time you spend using the computer
So since I 've started using this program , my computer time has gone down
It 's really summer , is n't it ?
It 's . luxurious !
It 's reminiscent of a taste during my childhood in my hometown .
When I close my eyes , I can see myself eating corn , sitting outside in front of my house .
All of the doors and windows are open , because there is no air [ space ] conditioner .
In my hometown , there is a very beautiful river .
Sometimes we went to the river with cucumbers , tomatoes , some cheap melons and occasionally watermelons .
It was the most enjoyable time for us students .
I still remember the cucumbers and tomatoes , withjust a little salt on them . They tasted very good !
But please do n't ask me what I ate for dinner yesterday .
I had a pre - speech contest today .
Unfortunately I did n't make it to the final because I made a fluff .
I was also told by a teacher that I made a fluff because I did n't speak from my heart .
That was a blow to me .
I know this is kind of a small matter but it was very , very regrettable anyway ! !
Please give me your advice .
At this class , lots of people were American teachers .
After that , I draw a picture about trees .
At that , we sung a lot of Beatles ' songs .
It was delicious but , I was still hungry .
Then , I sung a song called `` Under the Sea . ``
I could n't sung very good because my voice was so high .
Today was really full of fun , because we did a lot of things .
And I 'm interested in Fuel Cell research and the Internet .
There are n't any stimulating things at the University .
Working or studying energy and environmental technologies including Fuel Cell research in graduate school .
Repairing a Computer
Recently , There were some problems with my computer ,
When I turned my computer on , the screen was blank
Finally , my computer started to work again .
I 'm going to take the TOEIC ( exam ) this weekend .
I missed it in January since I got the flu the day before the test .
Therefore I 'm glad to be able to take it this time .
I wonder if my English vocabulary has been improving during this period .
I had my hair cut today because summer is coming soon .
The length of my hair is pretty short now , compared to before .
I feel so good .
Today , I went to the ( / my ) office by car .
I ride on a train as usual .

I did n't want to walk for a long time .
I like driving ( my car ) !

I think I 'd better buy a new car .
But , I do n't have enough money : ( .

I went to various parts of Japan .

Today , my mom told me that in a high school in my hometown , there was a student suicide .
Swimming is difficult for me although I live inSoutheast China , a place rich in rivers and lakes .
During this summer vacation , I decided to learn it .
I have already had two swimming classes from which I have learned some basic swimming skills . With more and more practice , I have fallen in love with it . It can keep me fit . What 's more , it 's also a good way to relax .
Do you love swimming ? Can you share your swimming experience with me ?

Soon the snow turned into snow storm .
When I pushed the break pedal , the car did n't stopp .
At the time , the ABS worked and the car stopped

In front of the sign board , we met a angel .

A Day Spent Waiting
Today , I wasted a lot of time waiting .
I waited the entire morning for my company 's car to help me deliver a shelf to my customer and also waited for my customer to put the shelf in the supermarket the whole afternoon .
What a boring day this was !
but I need to wake up now , because the sun is already high . . . ? ?
and also its Sunday today , , I need to go to the Church maybe later , , and later too at 3 pm . .

These are serious problems .
In Hong Kong , the government focuses on the drug problem .
Also , Many social workers are concerned about the family and violence problems .
However , there are no programs to deal with young people 's sexual behaviour .
But why has this issue in recent years been even more serious ?
The researchers note that `` If women are exposed to abuse , domestic violence , and family strife , it has enduring effects . ``
Also there are many cases which teenagers give up their babies in the street or have an abortion .
The most important thing is , they do not think they are wrong .
She wrote a diary and posted her pregnancy photos on the Internet .
She was proud of her pregnancy .
We have three kinds of solutions to solve the teenage pregnancy problem .
The second one is non - government and social workers . The last one is consulting with other countries ' policies .
Firstly , government should invest more in sex education .
Also , teenagers feel embarrassed communicating with their teachers and parents .
Their peer group also affects them .
For example , their peer group may give them the wrong messages regarding & nbsp ; sex .
Teenagers may misunderstand issues regarding sex when they receive incorrect information from their & nbsp ; peer group .
They are curious about sex and want to try it .
Sex education reduces the rate of teenage pregnancy .
Teachers can take care of teenagers when teaching them safe sex .
Also , it can reduce their curiosity and let them learn the the correct values .
Moreover , mass media gives unsuitable messages to young people . For example , Mother at 14 ( television drama ) , My Guardian Characters ( children 's comic book ) , and Juno ( Film ) provide & nbsp ; negative messages .
They may think teenage pregnancy is a universal phenomenon and part of & nbsp ; Western culture , or that & nbsp ; it is not a problem and not special .
Also , it can be perceived as a trend to follow .
So , the Hong Kong government should set up the law so & nbsp ; as to supervise the mass media .
I do n't need to use English in daily life .
I do n't have a strong reason to study English ,
I 'd like to read many books from English countries in English .
Whatever , I 'd like to use English for my work .

I 'm going to California in this July .
I also want to make friends with other exchange students and the host family !

Thank You E - mail
I got a job offer this week .
Other head hunters are sending me other job offers now .
Therefore I want to send thank you e - mails to the other head hunters who worked for me .
I have accepted it .
I am deeply grateful to you for your cooperation / help / assistance .
Sincerely ,
Let 's go to lunch !
Hi ! I 'll go to lunch after this .
I 'm thinking about what to eat .
Chinese , Italian or Indian food .
I did not eat breakfast and am very hungry !
Right now I 'm watching the movie `` American Gigolo ( I do n't know how should I spell it ) ``
Richard Gere ( I do n't know again how should I spell it ) plays ( stars ) in the movie .
In the movie , he was very young and so fine , so cute !
The college student is busy ^ ^ ; ( or undergraduate student )
Do you think that the college class is difficult ?
I am majoring in electrical engineering .
But it 's tough to keep pace with myself .
I was trying to concentrate on studying for the exam , but the sound of cicadas
Besides , it was really hot today .
Therefore , I decided to go to the library and then I made a good progress .
I am now busy with the computer examination , which will take place this Saturday morning .
I scanned the book this afternoon , and found that it was boring and not relevant to daily life .
However , as a college school student , I have to accumulate the necessary certificates to get a good job .
Estonian sumo wrestler , Baruto Kaito 25 years old .
His big smiley face makes me happy !
It is a charming garden city with picturesque scenery and pleasant weather .
SHENZHEN was setup as the economic special zone in 1980 .
It has developed from a small frontier town to a modern city , whose comprehensive economic strength has led the large and middle cities in china .
High - tech industries are feature that have constituted the first increasing section in the economic development of shenzhen .
In addition , there are about ten historical and cultural relics from the new stone age to Ming and Qing dynasties as well as modern revolutionary sites in china .
The china folk culture villages are showcases of the different arts , customs and architectural styles . ' being from life and yet going upon to a higher plain than life itself , absorbing what is good and rejecting what is bad ' is the guideline for the construction of the park
It 's easiest to listen to English in music , especially the Beatles and The Carpenters .
( Some music is impossible to listen to though ) . It 's second easiest to listen to English on the radio .
I often listen to J - wave in my car ( a Honda Fit ) .
The radio personalities on the programme are very friendly and polite , which means we can easily listen without getting offended , but sometimes I do n't like their goody two shoes attitudes .
At first , I noticed his familiar face when I was going to buy underwear at UNIQULO , the largest apparel company in Japan , but I was n't confident that he was my old friend .
Because I have n't met him since my junior high school graduation .
I did not write dairies for almost a week because I was lazy . ( I am not going to say BUSY ) My previous English tutor told me to never use BUSY as the excuse to postpone something , because no matter how busy you are , millions people will be busier than you such as presidents , CEOs , celebrities and a lot of people .
I went to the Chinese medicine hospital last Thu , helped my Japanese friend to find a sweet room on Fri , set up the internet and went to a darts bar with him on Sat , played beach vollyball and fooled around with some new friends at a beautiful beach in the north Taiwan on Sunday .
How do I become abetter English speaker ?
It 's just a matter of ( keeping ) practice .
Today , I got a day off and went to see the circus with my family .
The circus has run every season in this area
from ( since ) when I was a child .
I have never seen itlive ( or `` a live performance `` ) because I could have seen ( see ) it on TV
Actually , the live circus was interesting ,
My daughter 's pleasure was the best for me from this show .
But if someone asks me to go again , I wo n't go even ( if ? ) I pay .
Recently I have been a bit lazy . . .
decent : His father wanted him to get a decent education , so his family moved from his country .
innocent : He tried to prove his innocence , but no one believed what he said .
sensitive : She said her skin is sensitive to every stimuli , so she does n't want to go on a hike .
serious : I thought she was joking , but when I looked at her face , it was quite serious so I realized she was telling the truth .
noble : I think every person needs something noble in their life .
brave : My friend said I 'm brave , but I could n't find any brave qualities in myself .
I wonder if the usage of `` serious `` above is correct . It is ! = )
Thank you for always writing comments .
I 'm happy and study them .
I think that it is difficult to always think in English .
Because I want to study abroad someday , I 'll do my best .
It is nice , because I can study and learn new words .
I enjoy life every day .
I started learning english . recently
English is very difficult to me , but I enjoy learning .
Two diaries in one day .
I always write a diary twice a day .
Because I write in Korean and in Lang - 8 .
Every day . ! ! !
well , sometimes I forget to write in korean .
Hehe - _ - ;
During spring break , I would go to bed around 3 a .
m and sleep till 1 p . m .
The new semester will start next week and some of my classes will begin at 11 a . m .
It 's a shame to let them pass me by because of oversleeping .
So I have been waking up at 8 a .
It 's not easy for me to wake up early and sometimes I feel an irrestitible urge to sleep during the day , but still I manage to get out of bed by at least 8 a .
I have an appointment to meet my boss at my new job tomorrow a bit late at night .
I will fight to keep myself awake tomorrow ! !
The package included an electronic dictionary that I borrowed from her a long time ago .
I had forgotten to return it , but she suddenly called me and asked for it to be returned .
So I found it in my desk and she sent it with some souvenirs .
I called my mom and let her know it was sent by my wife this morning .
After I finished my work , I met a friend who is member of the same English circle .
She has a lot of DVDs which at last count was over 200 !
I introduced her to Lang - 8 .
I said it was good for studying .
Then we went for a little drink and had a good time talking .
She said she wanted to begin studying an English radio program .
So we will study the same program and compare what we learnt every week .
It started raining just as I got home by bicycle .
Yesterday , I bought a great deal of ripened tomatoes .
I should or , actually , I have to study hard this week - end , but you know , there 's always some stuff that catches my attention more than studying .
What is Happiness ? Part 2
While I was listening to her story , I was looking at my dinner that had already became cold .
Both of us were n't eating .
She sometimes expressed her tears and sighed .
Actually , I listened to her since I could n't encourage her .
However , I listened to her story silently .
All I could do was to grip her hands .
To tell you to the truth , I really wanted to hug her , but I could n't because I did n't want to surprise her .
Hugging is n't a part of Japanese culture .
That 's life . : (
It is cheaper to play now compared with before .
Though the origins of golf are unclear , it seems that shepherds knocking stones into rabbit holes is an established theory .
If it had been kept that way , it would cost nothing , right ?
Anyway , I really want to see Tiger play golf .
It is raining hard today .
In Japan , there are a lot of typhoons in September .
I am worried about getting back home .
The train will probably have to stop .
My interpreter 's class was so tough for me last lesson .
The theme was about social participation in Japan .
One of my classmates made a presentation about how Japan is struggling and facing tough economic times as well as political issues .
For the past twenty years , specially middle - aged men in particular have had many abilities and privileges .
They could control all of Japan .
However they do n't have enough abilities and publicity now .
So , we need to get a second wind .
In the future more people who are women , non - residence and youth should participate in any social movements .
It should be better than now .
That theme felt abstract for me .
I thought she should have focused more on the concrete details .
We are , naturally , always looking for the best method , the fastest way , the easiest path to mastering English , Japanese , Spanish , whateverish . . .
On the other hand , good methods [ Assimil ? ] when used wrong can produce poor results .
In the end , what you should know , what you should [ at least you should . . . ] notice by yourself is that there is n't A SINGLE METHOD for language learning .
Each student has to find his own method , his own way of learning .
Of course , this is n't an easy thing to do .
I know some things work and some do n't , but to find out exactly how to do it is n't that easy .
All methods have good and bad points , so what you have to do is notice the good points and use them in your own way .
Of course I 'm being a bit theatrical , but I just want to show that there is n't one method that rules over all others .
If you work hard on it , you probably will not only find out which learning methods and strategies suit you better , but you also will start to notice some universal principles about language learning .
The average language learner , who usually follows just one methods ( like many English teachers here in Brazil who have taught English using the same method for more than 20 years ) , will probably not learn these principles and , therefore , become kind of limited when it comes to how to learn a language .
We had a very good time playing a chasing game in the water .
I 'm very happy to see that my daughter started to have more confidence in the water because she could n't put her face in the water before she went to swimming lessons .
She was even scared of getting a splash on her face when she had a shower .
Now she can do a headstand in the water !
As her school will have swimming lessons starting soon , hopefully she will have no problem in the water and can enjoy swimming with others .
I can tell the chlorine in the pool was very strong since a splash of the water hurt my eyes quite a bit .
In addition to that , I felt really tired after getting out of the water although I had n't swum much .
It is already December .
Did you enjoy every day so far ?
If you go , you will not regret it .
Study More English
I want to know more English words , and I look words up with a dictionary .
I do n't know many English words and grammar and idioms and culture , etc . , , , , , I have no choice but to study English every day .
That 's why I have to go to Canada . I want to go there ! ! !
So , I dooooooo n't give up ! ! !
I do n't lose myself !
But I 'm Japanese , so my thinking of things is in Japanese . x ( I want to think things in English .
Grammar is difficult for me . x ( I want to have confidence in my English .
I goofed off yesterday .
And then , I stopped at a supermarket near my house to buy something to eat .
When I came back home , I left the things I bought at the drug store and forgot about it !
I remembered 2 hrs later , so I rushed to the supermarket and asked the cashier where they were .
Fortunately , he kept them , and I found / took them .
Please explain the following sentences .
( It happened ) right before she lost control of her reactions / emotions .
How are you connected to this situation .
The big one found you attractive .
We know how troublesome / difficult it is to do .
But I have a sore throat .
I wanna try to sing some songs .
Therefore , whenever I sing a foreign song I 'm always stifled .
Plz teach me good singing skills .
In Japan there is a flu going around .
Actually , it 's all over the world , is n't it ?
I also got it the other day , in spite of having been immunized !
But now , my fever has gone down with Tamiflu , several different types of Chinese medicine , and with my parent 's good nursing .
It totaled out to 6000yen ( $ 73 ) in sales .
Book - Off is the largest franchise of used bookstores in Japan .
To bring 3 carton boxes of books , I rented a car at Kichijoji .
I 'm a member of a car sharing system ' Times plus ' and I can rent a car for short periods .
It 's a very good system for those who do n't want to own a car .
Hi , everyone .
I like travelling , taking photos and shopping . ( ^ - ^ )
I have been to Canada , Australia and Thailand .
I hope to go Europe , U .
, Egypt and Japan ( ha ha ) to see
world heritage sites .
I think it 's important to always value nature .
NO natures NO life ( ^ - ^ ) / /
I talked about studying abroad with the / my professor .
I ate out with a friend .
A short time ago , my friend changed into a cockroach .
I 'll write about the story that happened in my bathroom .
I washed oneself with my body sponge , like a panda as they do everyday .
Then , something happened .
Suddenly `` this fellow `` passed by me quickly !
It 's a cockroach ! `` I shouted , and pointed the shower head at it .
After a few minutes , I was able to regain my calm .
It stopped moving .
It was the sponge 's ( panda 's ) leg .
I somehow laughed .
I decided to operate on it ( decided to weave its leg . )
After that , it was back to normal .
Now , it watches me from the desk .
What a fearful story that was ! !
It is difficult for me to speak and write in English .
And let 's tell own language to each other ! !
My thinking has come to a standstill .
I have no ideas .
So , there is nothing and nothing again .
Where did my inspiration go ?
I traveled with my class 3 days ago .
Although we were tired everybody felt pleased .
We took many photos ; about 700 .
we went to an island , its name is Thung Nai and it is a new tourist spot .
People who live there are friendly , it has fresh air and many fruit trees .
After this journey I understand my friends better and love them so much .
I think they feel the same way .
Today in Yokohama it was rainy , though I had fulfilled my plan in my previous journal .
The heavy feeling of my body was relieved by indoor climbing exercise .
Afterwards , my palm skin peeled and I could hardly move my tired body .
But I 'll have a good night 's sleep .
I must fight the feeling of not wanting to go to my office .
I guess I 'll suffer muscle ache tomorrow morning .
I 've read The Scheme Team , the 5th book in the Chestnut Hill Series .
The Chestnut Hill Series is written by Lauren Brooke .
They are 7th grader students in a boarding school for girls called Chestnut Hill .
The school has good horse riding programs as well as educational programs .
They face some difficulties .
But in each case , they help each other to overcome these difficulties .
In this series , the relationship with horses is n't so much the main topic of the story , compared to the Heartland Series .
Still the heroines ' devotion to horses is prominent in the story .
The interviewers asked us [ 18 interviewees including me ] to come up with an idea of a new product and the marketing strategy to make it outstanding .
I was really surprised but not nervous because I take International Business Management at the university .
There had been two interviews before I got the internship program .
Moreover , one of the new employees who had just come to work only two weeks before told me to finish his work of a 19 page translation within 2 weeks .
And to compose 17 English vocabulary poems for a SAT course .
I was and still am infuriated with the way they treat an internship student .
I get only 100 Baht per day , which is about 3 dollars a day !
My son
It 's been two days since I registered at this site
What a great site !
Anyway , I have a one - year - old boy .
He ca n't talk at all yet , but he always says `` Oh ! `` .
Whenever he finds something ( a dog , a light , a button , etc . . . ) , he says `` Oh ! `` .
He discovers something every day like an inventor .
I woke up few minutes ago .
I have a meeting today , so there work that I have to do .
I 'm really late .
A Firework Display !
I went to a fireworkdisplay on August 7 .
It was held near the sea at my hometown .
About ten thousand of fireworks were set off .
I went there wearning a yukata with my friends .
Both of them were delicious !
After that , I watched the fireworks .
They were wonderful and I was excited ! !
Have you ever seen the movie `` This is it `` ?
In Japan , the movie got to No . 1 on a weekly movie chart .
A lot of my friends have seen `` This is it `` and all of them have been enthusiastic about Micheal Jackson .
I 've also been a Michael Jackson fanatic since I was a teenager , but I ca n't go see the movie because I have to take care of my two young children with my wife . . .
BTW , I can do the dances in Micheal Jackson 's music videos , like `` Thriller , `` `` Billie Jean , `` and `` Smooth Criminal `` .
I will teach the dance of `` Thriller `` to my friend who is a dance club member .
I made a GM , which appears in Japanese animation `` Mobile Suit Gundam . `` I like this robot .
It is also fun to paint differently from the original version .
Yesterday , I submitted my graduation thesis .
I thought that submitting it was the same as the certification of my graduation since my thesis was already checked by my professor .
But in fact , I understood that in March I have to take an oral examination .
I 'm a little disappointed with this .
I had planned how to spend my holiday . . .
The days I have to study will continue . .
JP are too nervous to survive !
and let them go abroad for one year or so ! !
I sympathize with that way of thinking ,
I participated ina training workshop for sports orthopedics .
Each doctor spoke about `` knee problems `` .
The content of the speeches interested me .
I was especially interested in the speech about `` movement of analysis `` .
maybe I caught a cold : (
I think that maybe I caught a cold .
Usually I 'm the one who always complains about the air - conditioner in my office .
I always feel hot and I always shout `` It 's too hot `` at my colleagues , but now I have to turn off the air - conditioner .
I sit near the window so it 's the hottest place in the room but now although the sky is full of sunshine and all the heat is coming through the window I do n't feel any warmer .
I have to take some medicine first before a real cold catches me ( ^ _ _ ^ )
This is my first time writing an article using English !
I 'm a university student in Japan !
I like baking sweets , going on trips , listening to music , and playing instruments .
I can play a guitar and a piano .
And I love Japanese culture so I am learning about the Japanese tea ceremony .
I want to work in a foreign country in the future : )
I 'm a student of the department of history . However , I must learn more than that . Such as international relations , English , and Japanese .
Everyday , I study those four aspects from 7 : 00 to 22 : 00 .
And I always have no time to do any others .
someone told me I must speak English very well .
I need friend and I need people to be content with me . However , people do n't like me . Atleast this is what I think .
who can help me or tell me what can I do ?
My Anxiety
He had secretly smoked with his friends .
His teacher came to our house .
He told me what had happened .
This is the first time that I have heard of their misbehavior .
I thought my son wanted to escape from being forced to study by me .
I reflected on myself a lot and said to him ,
`` You do not have to study so much , so you should stay home . ``
I have heard the sound of them walking on the roof .
One day I heard a voice in his room so I opened the door to his room .
Then , I saw two boys hiding behind the bunk bed .
I asserted to them about a few things .
I am sorry that you do not keep the promises you made with me about not smoking and studying harder .
What should I do ?
This is my first time to use this site .
So I would like to communicate with whoever wants to ( speak with me ) .
I tend to believe in ghosts because I was born in small town .
The population of my town was low .
My neighbor 's house was old so it was easily broken when a typhoon comes to our region .
Before I tried to sleep at night , I always went to the restroom where I can see their house .
I could n't do anything because I was a kid .
I called my mom : `` Hey , I found a cockroach so please kill them . ``
`` com ' on mom ! ``
`` hurry up ! ``
I often used something like that .
My high school years ( 4 )
They entertained me nearly through all of grade 2 .
Of course , I was worried about my behavior when I was found enjoying them .
They finally found out .
I was suspended to make a self - examination . ?
At the beginning , though , I found that I could not catch up with my lessons , for I had missed so many lessons .
Because of this , it took me four years to finish the three - year junior high school .
She likes the new hospital because the doctor explains to her well .
It 's at a very easy level .
I heard it 's good to read many books in a suitable level .
Now , the number of words I can read is 2666 words .
5th generation iPod nano
I bought a 5th generation iPod nano last December .
So it is not easy for me to use Apple products .
I can import music into my iPod nano but ca n't understand the way to import any pictures .
Finally , today , I found out how to import some pictures into it !
I am very happy about being able to do that .
I had a very busy day today . I had two classes , checked students ' notebooks and there was a business trip .
I was going to go to conversational English class , but the English teacher caught a cold yesterday , so today 's lesson was canceled .
I went to a Mexican restaurant , `` El Torito `` tonight and ate Enchilada , Salsa chips , Ceaser salad , and ice cream and drank a Margarita which was frozen with a salt fringe around the glass .
I like Margaritas very much , but its alcohol level is kind of high , so I 'm always getting sleepy after drinking .
There are many tv screens hanging on the wall and the tv channel is always sports channel `` ESPN . `` Today 's sport was baseball .
football season will start in August . . . . .
so now all that we can watch is baseball games and hockey games .
Today is Guy Fawkes Night ( or bonfire night ) in Oxford .
Although it is officially the fifth of November , the event is to be held Saturday night this year .
Last year my wife and I went to the bonfire held at South Park .
Although it was a cold night , the large park was full of people .
Guy Fawkes tried to blow up Parliament in order to kill King James I of England and VI of Scotland , but failed and was arrested on the fifth of November in 1605 .
The failed assassination attempt is now known as the gunpowder plot .
For some reason , the British have been celebrating this day with a bonfire and fireworks for more than 400 years .
I 'm not even sure that the British are in favour of or are against Guy Fawkes himself and his plot .
In my opinion , most of them may be taking advantage of his failed attempt as a reason / excuse to enjoy fireworks .
For me as a Japanese , fireworks on a cold autumn night are very unusual and is quite a surreal experience , since fireworks are icons of the hottest summer season in Japan , reminding me the humidity and hot air , girls wearing yukata ( by the way , girls with yukata look 30 % more attractive and prettier than usual ) , kakigori ( crushed ice with fruit - flavoured syrup ) , and so on .
When a British `` guy `` visits Japan and see fireworks festivals in summer , what would he think / how would he feel ?
Drowsiness
I stayed up all night last night , and so I am terribly sleepy today .
However , I do it anyway .
Because drowsiness harms study , it is necessary to take care .
In most schools in Japan there is vacation during summer .
But I must go to school tomorrow .
Our school starts vacation at the end of this week .
I am looking forward to it very much .
Packers v . s . Falcons
One of the division play - offs is `` Packers v . s . Falcons `` .
The Falcons have beaten the Packers this season .
This clip tells me that the next game will be too close to call .
This movie 's origin is the graphic novel `` WATCHMEN `` , written by Alan Moore , illustrated by Dave Gibbons .
I can say , `` WATCHMEN `` challenges the reader 's mind .
What is evil ?
What is justice ?
What is humanity ?
We can be allowed to sacrifice someone to save the world ?
I 've had no time to write on Lang - 8 .
I 'm writing on Lang - 8 for the first time in a month .
I went to Shiga prefecture last week , and stayed at Biwako Hotel beside a lake .
At night , I watched the harvest moon .
I completely forgot about a lot of work .
Then he begins climbing the stairs .
I study English almost every day .
But I 'm not good at English .
Therefore , I want to learn to read , write and speak English .
By the way , I have a Twitter account .
I went out to a Yakitori restaurant with my collegue after work last night .
It was so hot during the day , so I wanted to go to a restaurant in which air conditioning works .
When we stood in front of the door of that restaurant , we found the door was open .
I had a feeling that what I did n't hope for would now happen .
Due to the hot atmosphere I could drink much more beer .
I felt more comfortable as wind sometimes blew into the restaurant .
As you might know , the Yakitori is a popular Japanese food .
It is made from several bite - sized pieces of chicken meat , or chicken offal , skewered on a Bamboo skewer and barbecued .
It is served with salt or with `` Tare `` sauce , which is generally made up of mirin , sake , soy sauce and sugar .
Yesterday I went to a famous fortune teller .
She is in Harajuku Tokyo and is called `` Mother of Harajuku `` .
I always inquire about my job , my marriage and my health .
She said that I 'll meet my destined woman next spring ! !
I 'm looking forward to meeting her .
I just have a question :
How do you say TO and FROM in Japanese
Or when you give a gift ?
I write in my diary on Lang - 8 in English for the first time .
So , I try to write in my diary to learn how to use English .
I write in my diary every day as much as I can / as much as possible .
Today , I went to a restaurant to eat okonomiyaki with my friends .
I could eat as much as I wanted .
However , I ate too much and have a sore stomach .
I 'm studying the immune system now .
I will explain about my research in more detail someday .
I passed the qualification exam , `` Eiken , Pre - one grade `` a few months ago .
applicants , so I think that is why they 're going to hold this sample test .
In these months , I have not been a diligent student .
I 'm always busy these days !
These days I 'm always busy because school has started .
Since school started , I do n't have much time to do anything I want to do .
Unfortunately , the only thing that I have time for is studying , studying , and more studying .
We are all going crazy now .
This year my teachers are funny . Also , I have joined a modern drama club .
Drama club is funny and exciting .
My new life , is full of happiness and fun times .
But my life is also full of pressure .
So , I need to study hard now .
I bought some stocks last Oct .
Since then , I 've been really interested in economics .
The economics in Japan is easily affecteed by that of foreign countries ( especially US ) .
Of course not only Japan , many countries ' economics are affected by other countries ' economics .
Now , in my country , many people were fired , and what is worse , it 's difficult for anyone to find new job .
There 's alot of bad news like this now . . .
However , do n't you think the relationship of economics between one country and another is interesting ?
I think it 's still too early for me to talk about economics in English .
Since I 'd like to know about these places as much as possible , I am reading guide books and checking the internet every day .
I Have Become Aware
Recently , I 've become aware that it 's not easy to earn money .
We never earn money at the time of working .
Maybe there are some jobs that can get lots of money a day .
But I do n't think they are absolutely good jobs .
Have a nice day ! !
It is a nice weather today !
I like such a day .
I had only a class on management today . It was boring ,
It means that the final - exams are coming soon .
Maybe I gon na turn crazy . . . . .
But I am not in the mood to study . . . . I am so lazy . . . . . .
By the way I am about to leave for home
Today my college will hold an event ! I think it will be fun !
This event is held once a year .
I could meet a lot of friends ! I am very excited !
This story shall continue later . . . . . . . .
I cooked two hamburger dishes yesterday .
I was going to play tennis in the afternoon .
But what makes these two videos totally different ?
When the sun shines , I will hold your hand and together we will walk along the streets .
Today I 'd like to tell a story about a drunk who lost his keys .
It 's a famous joke , so you may have heard it
I think it is a simple story but it teaches us important lesson about our life .
One night , a man goes out to drink at a local bar .
After saying goodbye to his friends , he begins walking home , singing happily
As he is getting close to his apartment , he takes his keys out of his pocket but drops them on the ground in the dark .
Once he realizes his keys are missing , he wanders around a street lamp and begins looking for them
I had a trouble with my English .
Though I have been learning English for a long time .
I knew my problem was that I cound 't catch the meaning what people had said , and my pronunciation was too bad .
I wanted to be able to master English conversation , but I spent most of the time studying grammar and even I tried to read newspaper and novels .
All study are helpful , but some of them are not effective .
It is important for me to know what I want and focus on it .
Japanese comedians sometimes parody the foreigner 's way of speaking Japanese .
The way they do this is by omitting particles , incorrect accent and intonation and it seems that they can be categorised by nationalities .
I suppose this may be true from my experiences and acutally English children learn nursery rhymes by language acquisition .
Otherwise , if Japanese learners mimicked their rhythm , even if it was strange Japanese , they might obtain the skill to speak naturally .
Junzo Kawada is a researcher in cultural anthropology and he went to Africa to research a tribe whose language does not have letters .
He claimed that they use their imagination to convey to their drums .
When I listened to this story , I thought this is like typing to a keyboard .
Because there are rhythm patterns when you hit the keyboard .
It takes about a minute to go the station . ( by foot ? )
I 'm going to commute , by subway , to my office which is in Liu Jia Zui .
I have to transfer to `` line two `` at Jing An Si station .
It 's a big station and there are a lot of shops and restaurants around there .
I drink coffee everyday .
My favorite coffee is Coffee Mocha .
This is a chocolate flavored coffee .
Because it tastes very bitter .
What type of coffee do you like ?
Laptops make people lazy .
I hate to use the laptop because it makes me lazy .
I use the laptop on my bed , I surf the internet , and finally I watch dramas . . .
it makes me NOT STUDY , and NOT EXERCISE !
I worked until late tonight .
I 'm very tired and ( very ) sleepy .
What are the most popular English websites ?
Which of them are the majority of Englishmen / Americans visiting every day ?
The best would be those with interesting contents , news , or sites about science , computer science etc .
I want to improve my ability to write in English .
I finished my work a little earlier than usual and bought a birthday cake for her on the way back home .
Our oldest son had a headache during the daytime .
Today , I read a magazine about environment .
The magazine is NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC .
I was impressed by an article written about jet man .
He flew by jet engine , which made the man a bird .
so he was called Bird man .
I think that the human dream is to fly in the sky , and I envy him .
I ate KAKIAGE - UDON for lunch .
KAKIAGE is a Japanese deep - fried food , which includes some vegetables such as carrot , onion etc .
UDON is a kind of noodles ,
wheat noodles .
It 's a sunny day
It 's a sunny day today .
The sun is shining brightly .
It makes me happy .
Yesterday I was not happy .
I went to my graduate school by bus .
On the way back home it was raining even more .
I got on the bus .
After I sat down , I checked my wallet .
Oh my god !
I had a bill of five thousand yen , but I did n't have anychange .
The fare of the bus was 220 yen .
On most Japanease buses , you ca n't get change .
He said he did n't have any change .
I asked him what should I do .
He said I could go without paying the fare , but next time I get on the bus I you should tell the driver this story , and pay the fare then .
I thanked him , and got off the bus .
On the way home from the bus stop I got soaking wet .
Hi everyone , nice to meet you .
Because Gunma is not a famous like Tokyo , and Kiryu is in that prefecture 's countryside .
I had to pay for electricity and Internet .
In Tanzania , almost everything is an advance payment system while everything is a later payment in Korea .
Here , I use a prepaid electricity system called LUKU .
I have to buy voucher first if I want to use electricity .
( I 'm not sure whether voucha is an English word or not . ) ( voucher is correct )
in case of mobile phone and Internet and so on . . . . .
I could n't use internet during last weekend beause my internet valid period was over on last Friday .
Thus , I had to go to town today .
I bought some fruit and a bottle of wine on my way to town .
I also bought a wine glass to drink / for drinking wine .
I drank a glass of wine and I felt so good .
I may look like an alcoholic : - (
We have a good time there , because our house is bigger than our old house that we lived in a month ago .
It is not national a sport ,
but we can watch every match on NHK national TV broadcast .
In Japan , sumo matches are held 6 times per year .
The festivals on odd number months are held in tokyo ,
and even one 's are in other areas such as Osaka Naoya and Kyusyu .
last Sunday , the festival in Osaka began .
It is called `` Haru - basyo `` which means spring season .
Recently , we can see foreign sumo wrestlers , especially from mongolia .
If he wins the championship this season , he will be selected as `` Ozeki `` .
I had planned to go skiing with my family this weekend ,
but I canceled when we heard about this disaster .
It would have been the first time for my children to go skiing .
Recently I 've had insomnia .
I 've felt very tired .
What should I do ?
neck is stiff and back is sore too .
What is the difference between `` can `` and `` kin `` ?
Today 's Work
I have to make a document by Friday .
I finished making the document today .
Me and my staff visited one client and had a meeting with them .
In that meeting , there was a hard negotiation between us and the client .
We discussed about how to operate this deal .
Finally , we set the date of our next meeting and agreed on our next points to discuss .
Pollen is blowing everywhere .
It becomes warm and confortable to go outside .
Pollen gives me hayfever .
When I was looking up the word ' agitate ' in dictionary , I found an example which confused me .
A big mosquito has bitten me !
There 's a mosquito in my room .
It looks very big .
He already bit me a couple times when I was taking a nap .
I do n't want him to live all night long . . .
My friend who is Japanese can listen carefully thier sound and then he can tell if they are male or female .
I think that if they are male , they do n't want ( to bite me / my blood ) .
I ca n't do the same as my friend .
But I think the mosquito in my room is female .
Because it bit me in two places .
I am itchy now . . . .
On our project meeting , we talk about what each person trying next week .
Anyway , we have kind of a strange custom for christmas .
Eating KFC chicken is one of the example for our unique custom for christmas .
My cousin said my diaries always are so short , but I do n't know what I can write in the diary .
Mosquitoes like this weather .
They fly into the house when someone opens the door .
I am on a train on the way to my university .
Whenever I 'm on a train , I observe people in there , especially those who are on the opposite seat from where I 'm sitting .
About 10 people can sit down on the seat , but I can see 5 people at first sight .
Now , three girls are playing with their mobiles and two old guys are sleeping .
Ah , the train arrived at the station , so I have to change trains .
As I wrote on this diary on November 4th , one of our managers gave a lecture on cost management .
The measure to deal with the falling birthrate
DPJ 's main policy to combat the falling birthrate is by giving 26000yen per child per month to parents .
I think that it 's not enough and not a good policy .
I read an economist opinion in the paper that said `` Big companies should set up day - care centers for children . `` The same paper said that Itochu , a famous trading company , set up a day - care center .
According to the article , Mitsui Bussan and Sumitomo Shoji , which are also famous trading companies , already have their day - care centers .
I think & nbsp ; that companies having their own day - care center is very good idea , and a very good measure to address the falling birthrate .
Most of the fathers or mothers would go to day - care centers on their way to the office and they take more time for commuting .
But if their company has a day - care center they can go to their office with their children without time consuming detours .
If a day - care center is near their office , they can easily go there to watch their child 's life .
So I wish many more companies would set up their own day - care centers near their office and many people can easily have both a career and children .
I will start my diary .
Recently , It has been very hot ! !
then I tried to sleep again .
It was too tiring to do in the morning .
I 'm working at admission center of a university in Japan .
I do n't like office work , but my colleagues are very funny .
so I can keep on working there .
Our boss gives us ice cream sometimes .
but I have decided to go abroad or take part in working holiday next year .
that ` s it for today .
I have to study English more .
If you go and look at the moon , it appears to move with you .
And , if you 'll look at it carefully , you might notice that it has a human 's face : a nose , raised eyebrows , a lovely smile . . .
One dark night , Ira Dmitrieva was coming home , but the moon 's smile was n't lovely for her .
On the contrary , the moon seemed to tell her : `` You 'll see how you will be met at home .
`` It 's very late . ``
Ira looked at the ground and thought : `` If only my parents were sleeping ! ``
She wanted to blame someone , but she knew that she could n't .
Ira looked quickly at the windows of her flat on the fifth floor .
Much to Ira 's dismay , there was a light on inside .
`` What should I tell them ?
Ira remembered how her mom 's voice sounded when she was angry .
Ira was very scared .
I watched a movie called , `` Broken English `` alone yesterday .
I got a day off suddenly and I wondered what I would do .
Eventually , I watched it but it was really boring .
It was about a lady who falls in love with a French man .
I thought he could n't speak English fluently which was the reason of the title , but he could .
He only made one mistake , and it was mixing up angry and hungry .
He said he was hungry , but she realized that he was angry .
It was really funny because his English was really fluent .
I have finished two line drawing ( handmade sketches on paper ) , I am going to color it in class tomorrow , so teacher could correct me simultaneously .
she went to see a doctor in a big hospital .
And yesterday , she came back with the result .
The result of the blood test and CT scan were all normal .
Actually , she had terrible constipation . . . .
Because of my doubts I researched something about this topic on the internet and I discovered that for some people it 's not easy .
but I think this test would last five minutes !
The champions league 's 2nd leg of the quarter finals were held yesterday and today .
In the quarter finals , Raul , who belongs to Schalke , got the goals in the 1st leg and the 2nd leg , which gave me goose pumps .
I start ( started ) lang - 8 today .
I 've been thinking about why I want to study English .
And tonight I got a part of the answer .
I have a feeling that it is different from everybody else 's ( reason ) .
But everybody has a reason why they want to study second launguage .
I want to study hard so I can explain my answer .
I was a child when I first watched this movie .
It was amazing , the story line in particular .
In the last scene of this movie , Doc dropped an important cable from the roof of the school many times .
I almost destroyed the TV in anger .
I can imagine , after this movie released , many American kids played with skateboards on the road .
I think the best ways to learn Korean are the same as English .
The best way to practice listening is watching Korean dramas or movies .
I will give you one .
Read out loud even though you do n't understand the meanings .
Every day , read Korean books out loud , you will eventually master it .
If you do n't have a friend to talk to , you can talk to me through skype .
Maybe , you can speak in Korean to your family , even though they do n't understand it .
It is good practice .
I think this is the hardest one .
The best way is to write some things on this website and ask native Koreans to correct them .
I , actually , hated studying English when I was in high school .
My College 's Anniversary Celebrations
April 18th is a special day .
It 's just one day away , and the college will be bustling with noise and excitement , I think .
I will be busy receiving former students [ 1 ] on that day , because many of them are looking forwad to revisiting their old college . [ 2 ]
Some of them have achieved great success in society , so they want to see how their former university [ 1 ] has developed in recent years .
My college has had a splendid 50 - year history .
Since I entered it in 2007 , it has developed greatly .
Its full name is Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine .
Have you ever graduated from university ?
Tell me something about your college . [ 2 ]
Drank with my Co - workers .
Yesterday , I went to drink with my co - workers in an IZAKAYA .
I spent a few hours reading e - mails .
I could n't finish all of my work today , but I can take another vacation for this weekend .
I 'm looking forward to getting the vacation .
I need a certain amount of salary to support my family , however my current salary is not good .
So yesterday , I looked at some job hunting websites .
Do n't ask me `` Why did n't you wait to get married until you had a high paying job ? `` At that time I was very desperate to settle down in Singapore .
Needless to say , speaking a foreign language like a native speaker is almost impossible for everyone except native bilinguals .
But for me , `` business English `` sounds like . . . `` almost perfect English . `` As far as I can see , Such super Japanese workers do n't exist .
Are there many Japanese people who can speak English like native speakers somewhere in Singapore somewhere that I do n't know yet ?
What the heck is business English ?
Last night my friend told me about Lang - 8 , and I think it is very good for studying English . .
I wish to make friends with you guys . . .
Today is a beautiful and sunny Saturday !
I usually spend my weekends going shopping or doing exercises or just relaxing .
I always think that keeping an English diary is a good way to practice my English skills .
But , unfortunately , I somehow did n't do it .
Therefore , I chose to join Lang - 8 !
It has been 1 year since I came to the U . S .
But even though my English h [ / BLUE ] as not improved , one thing that I have felt is that I am not afraid of using English any more , even though I could not understand what people said .
In other words , I do not care about the people around me .
I do n't know if it is good or bad .
I am still eagerly wishing that I could use English like a native .
Second , I am going shopping .
I hope I will have a good weekend , and so will all of you !
At first , when I did n't understand the meanings of new words , I looked them up in the dictionary .
But , by doing that , I did n't read quickly .
( If the book belonged to me , I read it that way .
I understand the content up to now and will finish reading by Jun . 21 .
Thank you for reading .
Hello my name is `` Pobiron `` , I 'm a university student in Japan .
In the future I would like to use English in my work .
My friend told me about this web site .
And if you know a good place for my study abroad , please tell me : D
I will go to graduate school next year .
In Japan , most graduate students start looking for a job in their first year ( except for those who go for a doctorate ) .
I 'd like to experience working overseas before looking for a more permanent job .
So I 'll think about taking a year off to join an internship program in Europe .
I wrote that I often licked my lips before .
It 's called ' Burt 's Bees ' . It was bought as a souvenir from America .
My lips now feel enriched : )
I 've not been there for half a year .
It is generally accepted that our country called Japan has been influenced by many great people across the country .
I think one female singer is the latest great person who produces a powerful effect on Japan .
I would like to write about her impact in this essay .
For example , she often sings her own name in her songs .
Not only are her songs unique , but her fashion sense is as well .
For example , she dyes her hair into strange colours ; white , yellow and green .
Her costumes are also sexy and unusual .
Recently , she wore a black onion costume when she appeared on `` Room of the Tetsuko `` which is Japanese famous TV program , because Tetsuko 's hair style looks like an onion .
Furthermore , LADY GAGA gave Tetsuko candy that she took out of her spiral hair .
Many Japanese people were so surprised .
I went to a baseball game .
I am a Hanshin Tigers fan .
I saw someone waving Japanese flags on the bleachers .
Not a problem , but it does n't fit with a baseball game .
Normally they use Hanshin Tiger 's flags .
Then I could see they were a foreigner .
Then I understood .
That is what 's most important !
In Japanese , New year 's resolution is called `` HOUFU `` .
Most of their `` HOUFU `` is about their work .
At Japanese workplace 's parties , almost everyone talks about work .
I 'm tired of that topic .
hmm . English is easy , but people regard it as difficult .
Why do people think English is very difficult ?
Actually , English is very simple .
Who makes English difficult ?
English teachers !
They are saying that English is hard for you .
So you need help , such as a friend , teacher , and so on .
This is a lie .
When I 'm depressed , I feel everything will turn in a bad way .
I ca n't connect with my boyfriend , because he is at the party hooking up with some girls .
One of my friends have n't replied to my e - mail because she got in trouble or she does n't wanna talk with me .
I dreamed somebody in my family will die and wake up crying .
Actually nothings . bad has happened .
How can I wake up from this nightmare here ?
Today , I gave a presentation .
I spoke well and confidently .
I did n't get nervous at all .
However , I failed to illustrate the next subject .
I finished the presentation thanks to friends and our teacher .
I felt I needed to make lots of effort to improve my English .
Someday I want to give a good presentation like the other students .
After the lesson , I went to the library to return a DVD .
Then , I went to the agency to upgrade my driver 's license , but it turned out I was not able to upgrade it .
I need to submit a certification , but until I contact the Japanese embassy for it , I ca n't get a new license .
After that I went to a bank to get some information about how to open a bank account .
On the way home , I dropped by an appliance store in Southgate and bought a portable radio .
John , a kind clerk , recommended a good one .
He showed me one that works with solar power and also has a dynamo crank .
Of course I got that one .
After that I went to a bicycle shop and they only handle special types of bicycles .
So I went there for nothing .
Finishing the presentation was a big load off my mind .
Now I can get ready for my final examination tomorrow .
A question
I was watching the big bang theory and characters were using the phrase `` bite me `` and I was wondering what that means ?
By the way , this sheldon guy is very funny and the whole show is fantastic .
The road in front of my house has cherry trees along the street .
Only one tree blossom is visible .
I hope another cherry blossom will show early . We would be happy .
I look forward to it .
What would be a good choice for me ?
so I have to become better at speaking english ,
so I decided to go canada and already got a working holiday visa .
after 5 months I 'll go there .
I have n't decided anything .
the place I 'll go , how to use my working holiday visa well . . .
I got a working holiday visa so that I could learn English at a language school .
After that , I thought I 'd get a Marketing or Business certification , and use it to get an internship .
are too high .
I need money to live .
So far , there 's nothing that can get me a good internship .
What can I do with bad English ?
I would have to work as a dishwasher or something like that , gosh !
I do n't want to make the wrong choice .
I think it is my last chance in my life for my dream to come true .
I had really good time on New Year 's Eve and New Year 's Day .
However , I have to start my activities tomorrow .
I have a lot of job interviews this month .
It 'll be tough , but I 'll enjoy it .
How to be used to doing routine work .
I may be lazy , because I have never planned my schedule .
I 've always thought that making a schedule was boring .
But the situation has changed , recently I 'm thinking about my future .
I went to a soccer game today .
We played at a school .
The result was three to two .
The next game 's opponent was Senri Higiri .
The result was six to zero .
First , last Wednesday I took an exam at the university .
All day it was raining .
At lunch , a light rain induced me to buy a delicious dish ( empanadas ) .
I finished the exam really fast and then I went home to sleep .
I chose some subjects that will allow me to keep working while studying .
My career , engineering , really takes time to be completed , and it is really easy to lose years if you do not pass one subject in time .
I started to study this week , I feel confident I will have a nice semester .
A bit of good news is that a coworker lent me a book about kanji . . .
all written in Japanese .
Nowadays my current topic in Japanese is to end learning katakana . That is why I have to wait until I learn more vocabulary , verbs in particular .
It is raining in Tokyo again . . .
today I have a job interview
then I 'm gon na eat breakfast after taking a shower
What important lesson have you learned from a family member ? alternatively from you family
My parents taught me a lot of things .
And they said you have to take risks if you want to become succesful .
Also they said it is important to focus hard / well in order to contend / overcome with difficulties .
When I have to choose something , I always remember these lessons and decide which will really help me / make me stronger in the future in order not just choose the easy one .
Many kinds of drinks are all free , and are self - service .
My favorite comic is `` JOJO ' S BIZARRE ADVENTURE `` published serially in `` A boy Jump `` ( the most famous Japanese comic magazine ) .
I never finish reading all the chapters of `` JOJO ' S BIZARRE ADVENTURE `` . I always read it when I go to an internet cafe .
It was so fun that I forgot the time when I had to return home .
I have to do the laundry and take a bath .
I speak , of course , of free men who have a choice , not condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly limited .
For example , listening to music , watching movies , going shopping . . .
Because , when I do my favorite things , I can be more relaxed .
Also , I consult my family or friends .
This way , I will feel better .
We will go to the children ' shospital this morning .
Riku also pees and poos a lot !
My wife is drinkinglots ofDandelion coffee
The humid weather caused some mold in our house .
It looks better now and he is really satisfied with it .
If it comes to be food , what word can I use ?
This year ,
the new MacBook has been released , and the iPhone and iPad as well !
I have all of it , fortunately . ^ _ ^
I debuted as Mac user in 2010 .
Macs are much more fun than Windows for me .
Spring has come
My name is Natalie and I 'm from Kiev .
A lot of people have smiles on their faces .
Ladies have just begun to wear light coats and high heel boots .
There was something beautiful and alluring in the pale and ( slightly ) grey faces of the strangers .
The time when you promise yourself to start a new life .
Sorry , today ` s journal is so / very simple .
I will go to bed at once .
He just / only complimented me on my voice .
I used to write Chinese diaries but later I changed to writing in English and now I give up both of them because I want to you to help me with my English writing and also give myself the chance to practice my English typing speed .
I am not good at it so I become tried quickly .
This morning I did n't have classes so as usual I stayed in the self - study room and did some studying .
It is very interesting and I have almost finished it so I am eager to do it as soon as possible .
I usually run ten laps ; each lap is four hundred meters long .
If there is anything fun or special , I will definitely let you know because you are my sincere listeners .
I have recentlyfilled in the application form and curriculum vitae because they arenecessaryfor job hunting .
Use of aPC is not allowed .
Secondly , It itcannot be erased , even if I make a mistake in writing .
So if I make a mistake , I must write again from scratch on a new piece ofpaper .
I got the result of my TOEIC test today .
I scored 820 .
It 's the best score I 've ever received .
But I do n't think that the score reflects my current English skill .
Anyway my Lang - 8 friends helped me brush up my English !
I went shopping and bought a book .
I also ate ice cream .
There were sliced apples and walnuts in it .
Lots of articles written , If a man wants to ask you out , you should say NO at least twice , then say YES .
Especially for me , if you do n't say anything
So , please , just ask anyway .
The coach 's advice were to watch a ball carefully and hit the ball on center of racket .
He adviced again that it was good to practice swings a few minutes every day .
He also advised me that it was good to practice tossing the ball on the racket .
He belonged to a table tennis club and he went there two times a week .
He said that tennis and table tennis are the same .
He recommended me to start with table tennis .
You know , it is very difficult for Japanese to pronounce `` R `` and `` L `` correctly .
I know how to pronounce R and L
But , when it comes to `` plate `` , I pronounce it `` prate `` .
But , when I pronounce it very quickly , I pronounce it `` prate `` .
Today I have to give a presentation to incoming freshmen on my graduate school experience .
I am not nervous but I want to finish early because I have lots of work afterwards .
Regardless I want to do my best .
Are the Japanese liars ? ( in English )
For example , saying `` See you soon `` despite not seeing afterwards , saying `` You speak Japanese very well ! `` when hearing only a few words . . .
For we Japanese these are the unintentional expression or just the normal speaking that we want to communicate with other person naturally though it seems to be a lie at the other point of view .
I laughed at the MELONPAN which has no Melon ( ~ _ ~ ; )
( In Japan there 's a bread called MELONPAN ( melon - bread ) but there is no melon in it )
Everyone , do you think Japanese is liar according to the above cases ?
Why do I like sweets so much ?
I ate tiramisu and a piece of cheese cake today ! !
I like sweets better than dieting .
Yesterday night I attended a teacher - parent conference . At the conference most of the parents were talking about their
children 's academic performance . They think that if their children have low grades , they will lose face .
They only care about test scores , not the learning process .
In my opinion , test scores are just an indication of children 's previous learning .
Parents should care more about the children 's learning process and learning methods and help them overcome difficulties in their learning .
What is a healthy life ?
But now it has changed a lot .
I almost do n't read books anymore , and cancel meetings with the excuse that I had too much work to do .
Today a friend here on lang - 8 who comes from the USA corrected my entry , and he said that he was in a computer lab , and would reply to me next time , maybe even next week .
Tomorrow is another day , I live today , everything in my mind happened yesterday .
I can speak Cantonese well .
Tomorrow I will go to Auckland Zoo . . . .
I learned about this website from a book , which tells me how to improve my English using iPad .
I hope I can keep writing my diary in English here .
The Dodgers baseball team is coming to Taiwan .
I 'm so excited to see a baseball game in Taiwan ! !
The cause may be because of an improvement in my writing skills , but I am still not perfectly convinced .
am I feeling that speaking is the worst of my English skills at the moment , even though I used to feel that speaking was the best .
They sit around my table and they become my conversational partners that day .
I think my cheerful personality will cause a good result .
The other advantage is the existence of the conversational partners in front of me .
And also , speaking is a two - way and real - time communication , so we can confirm the meaning with each other .
In other words , there is no immediate way to know how much people will understand what I wrote .
In addition to the advantages and disadvantages between the types of communication , there is a limitation to my English level .
I really hate it when someone misunderstands me .
That 's why I did n't like writing somethings in English .
The whole Daiichi plant has six nuclear reactors .
All six reactors are shut down and three out of the six are especially dangerous .
This URL is the electric company 's press release written in English .
I hope this URL will help those people who ca n't read Japanese .
I am afraid of the future !
We thought these were fiction but they may be reality in the future !
Is that good ?
Or is that bad ?
Since I have become bored of American food , it was very good .
I 've never eaten such good Vietnamese food .
I ate too much , so I could n't eat dinner .
We really enjoyed lunch and chatting .
San Do told me if we love to eat good oriental food , we should go to a restaurant where are lots of oriental people .
I love American supermarkets because they 're very big and there is so much stuff .
I bought some bananas , one super big bottle of fruit juice , a pack of chocolate cookies , ten discounted DVDs ( each one was just 5 dollars . ) and a bottle of perfume .
I also would love to go to Wal - Mart in Florida again and buy some more DVDs .
My painting teacher , Sand Do is Vietnamese .
While taking his class , he told me how he mastered English .
He also watched a bunch of movies in English .
Watching movies is one of the best and most interesting ways .
Until I come back here next time , I would really like to improve my comprehension skills more ; I would like to become able to communicate with my American friends much more .
He ran and jumped around when he first came into his new home .
He 's a naughty boy , is n't he ?
I named him Pika .
I named him Pika , not because he is like a rabbit with short ears .
Actually , it 's because of pikakutar .
( Does anybody know what that is ? )
He has straight white fur and pretty eyes .
He is only three months .
Oh ! A young puppy really has a lot of curiosity about the big big world .
Just like a part of my body .
I will also treat him tenderly and with care .
( but I 'll still be angry with him and blame him when he does anything serious . )
I hope you can share your experiences with me : )
My parents came to Tanzania to meet me for one month .
At the first when I met them at the airport , I thought that one month would be a very long time to travel around .
Today is my first time here . I 'm very happy that there will be some friends to help me study English .
Today is the twenty - second .
In Tokyo of Japan , there are `` sample trees `` of cherry blossoms in the Yasukuni - jinja .
Someone declared cherry blossoms began blooming when they found some flowers came out ( of the sample trees ) .
There were cherry blossoms that bloomed yesterday .
But they considered it less than enough for declaring .
There are some cherry blossom trees in my neighborhood .
There are many famous locations to see cherry blossoms .
( For example , the Chidori - ga - fuchi in the Imperial Palace and the Ueno - park . )
actually I have n't cooked for a while .
I love to cook .
but I love more to cook for someone else ,
She does n't ever skip breakfast in the morning for my family .
when I was a student , I really do n't want to eat the breakfast she made every morning .
Now I can understand how hard she worked for my family .
Anyway !
I feel happy whenever thinking of the upcoming Lunar New Year 's Day with my family .
After the New Year , I will start a diet . . . . . . . .
Can I ?
Recently , I have been studying for 3 or 4 hours a day , but Reading and Listening were mainly the large part .
Speaking and writing were less , particularly , just before Toeic .
To be honest , studying to get a highscore was not an interesting moment for me .
I wish I could write a diary entry everyday .
lang - 8 . com is a nice website to improve my English abilities ! !
Now , I 'm on vacation .
What I did - and it was really nice - was go to a rock concert performed by local band .
Hope everyone is having fun n summer !
I have a question .
I 'm learning English now , but my English is very poor .
How can I improve my English ? Oh my god !
Writing a diary in English everyday is hard for me .
I ca n't ( manage to ) make enough time for it .
If we make a crease even once on the pattern , it wo n't go away .
The crease will never disappear .
Last weekend , it was a long day off because last Friday was Memorial Day for devoted people in war , such as deceased patriots , soldiers and officers of armed forces .
The national holiday plus the weekend , I had three days to do something .
On Friday , it was a cleaning day because my parents wanted the wooden floor to be cleaned up .
So for a half day we cleaned it up , my parents and I were exhausted .
I could n't do anything but relax .
Last Saturday , I felt down and wanted to go out for a walk so I went to Haeundae beach alone .
As you know , sometiems people do n't want to be together , just be alone .
When I arrived there , there were so many people who enjoyed with their family , lovers and friends .
I walked by myself along the beach and sat down on the sand to do some thinkingand watching the sea view .
And I joined the private conversation club for improving English skills .
Every Saturday it is held in Seomyeon .
Because it can be improve my English speech skills and it makes people come together as well .
To briefly let you know this club , for five hours people talk about several topics and make small talk .
There are no restrictions to join the club , just enroll on the website and then you can attend it every Saturday .
Once joining this club , I do n't go back home after finishing conversing .
Usually people go out to drink soju and beer lightly .
And do something else like play sports , such as playing pool , bowling and singing to karaoke .
As usual , we went to play pool after finishing conversation .
We agreed on payment for pool .
but I hooked up with her friend .
I do n't know why I did that .
I will write a diary of daily events and thoughts .
At first , my writing is awkward but , I should make progress every day .
I have loved reading cartoons since I was a child , especially Japanese cartoons .
Though Chinese cartoons have improved a lot , I still love the style of Japanese cartoons .
The cartoon called `` Rurouni Kenshin `` is an early and special memory of mine .
I do n't know how to express my feeling about this complex issue .
The cartoon called `` Rurouni Kenshin Memories `` is very good , it 's worth watching .
I answered ' Yes , I understand .
Is this correct ?
or should I have answered ' Yes , I do .
when should I answer ' Yes , I do .
I was so happy , but I needed to cook by myself . I tried to do my best , so I bought many dumplings , because they are easy to cook . I ate them for two days . I played basketball with my friend in the afternoon for four hours . I had a good weekend .
`` Terrorism `` comes from the wordterror
Yes , I 'm afraid of abombing in the U .
S . - especially in Times Squarebecause my dad livesnearby .
I think it 's moreimportant , though , to realize that we tend to worry too much about therisks next to us , and tend to ignore those that seem to be far away .
For example , Swine flu has killed over / around17000 people in theU .
And it will continue to kill this many people , more or less , every year .
Can we be making too much of this issue right now ?
Stockingfood , water , andmasks in cases , checking CDC everyday ?
Another example - car accidents kill about 40000 people every year , butwho gives up driving ?
Yes , we can control risk and our minds .
However , once we trap fears of small localattacks in our minds , `` terror `` can easily over - control our minds .
That makes us dumb and we ca n't correctlyanswer these kinds of questions - `` Which is more serious ? `` and `` Which can kill more ? ``
However , if we have theright information , it will help us to overtake the effects of fear .
The financial crisis makes iteasy for usto lose our temper , so that 's the reason I wanted to share this with you .
I feel nervous a little bit . . .
The book my brother gave me motivated me to learn English .
I had n't understood how to study English .
It wrote about the reasons Japanese are weak with English and the method Japanese use to study it efficiency .
My opinion about studying English was not completely wrong : p
It is whether I 've tried it or not .
I look forward to bringing about great changes in my brain on this studying abroad .
Today is a traditional festival in China . I want go home early , but I have a salon class at 6 o ' clock . I 'm so sad !
/ Photographs ( Photography ? )
In particular , I would like to speak English fluently .
I can show you some beautiful Kanji and basic Japanese .
Why do n't we do a language exchange ?
If you are interested in my profile , please contact me on here or on Skype ( ID : crystaldew530 ) .
I think using foreign languages makes me discover new things about myself .
Actually , this is my profile for my top page .
I 'm afraid this essay may sound strange .
If it 's alright with you , would you correct these sentences ?
I love music . / I love the music .
It 's a quarter after one I 'm all alone and I need you now .
The stress of study has caused enteritis starting the day before yesterday .
I feel a little bit of pain in my stomach and have a slight fever .
I 'm sorry if I made you lose your appetite .
I just wanted to use some expressions I learned yesterday because of my situation .
The difference of the smoking rates between males and females in Japan is much wider than that in other countries surveyed .
It seems to me , therefore , the difference of the rates will disappear if more and more women begin to work outside the home .
Yesterday , I browsed a Lang - 8 diary that was written by Ms .
She wrote about a TV - drama called IRIS .
The drama 's production cost was 1 . 5 billion yen , and Mr .
Lee Byung - Hun starred in it .
The drama will be broadcasted in Japan tonight .
I would like to watch it .
My pc has lasted almost a month since I got it back ( a month ago it was dead , T _ T ) . Everymorning when I get up , the first thing I do is to turn the pc on and think what I am going to do .
when all of these are done , I 'm confused again and have totally no idea what I am going to do .
yeah , actually there are lots of stuff I need to finish , but I just ca n't focus my mind on them . I do n't want to read or do something like paperwork .
I do n't even know why I am staying here .
My friends told me , `` You must come back . Do n't be like this . You are going to graduate soon . You must wake up , prepare for it . `` But I just ca n't .
what can I do ?
It was fun and it was good experience .
Now I wanna go to Seattle to watch the baseball game .
The first time ~
Wow !
This is my first time to write something here .
I hope this will be fun .
I would like to meet someone new , and make some friendships here . .
Cool ~
It 's 8 : 19 AM in Colombia ^ ^
I like snowy days very much .
I like to see the snow flowers dancing in the air and slowing down to the ground .
I stretched my palm to wait for the snow dancing to it and put it in my mouth ; of course I would put it in together with a prune , tasting the favors of salt , sour and sweet .
And then you could see white snow everywhere , clean and bright .
I still could remember the first time I enjoyed the snow .
When my classmates and I decided to sacrifice our sleeping all night to climb to the top of Seven - Star Mountain , we put on all the heavy clothing we had .
When we went out to our apartment , there were crowds parading on the road .
We joined to the crowds and laughted ourselves crazy .
It was a really nice time and we enjoyed it very much .
I got a little satisfiedwith speaking English .
Yesterday our business partner came to Japan .
Surely we were able toconverse in English .
Since nowadays I study writing English on this page and I can speak better than before .
I suppose that writing English is amost the same as speaking .
I got a little satisfiedwith that .
I 'm studying English via web lesson with the Phillippino teacher .
They are very kind .
The web lesson is useful and fun for me .
For countable words , use `` many `` .
For uncountable words , use `` much `` .
I think these are countable words .
Also , what should I say to answer ?
I do n't want to repeat one more year .
Hi , my name is Yu .
I have done self - study until now .
Mostly , I studied in the train when I commuted to my office .
But I realised that it will be difficult to master conversation and writing that way .
Recently , the MTR had a short film competition .
Using `` 103 `` as a topic for the films .
No matter what , whetheryou are young or old ,
Trying to do something that is special to make your life happier is the mostimportant thing .
just a way to explain / express thatwe are the best of our own .
A Busy Life !
I feel that many things must finish ; for example : my homework , my program , and so on .
We have some course left but I do n't want to go to class because other things seem more important and my course is not interesting .
Although I always go to class , I read my book and do n't listen to what my teacher 's saying .
Recently , some classmates had colds so they did n't go to class .
I used to run , but I have not had enough time to do it lately .
Fortunately , I have a good body so I can do many things ; however , I feel too tired at the moment .
It 's a busy life but it is happy !
I drink a lot of water and buy 1 . 5 liter bottled Volvic every day on my way to the office .
They 've been so good to me even though they 've had some tough times recently .
I cried when I hugged his mother goodbye .
It was very delicious .
I am writing to ask you about the plan to build a shopping center near the park .
I found out about the plan today by reading a newspaper article about an interview in which you were explaining the plan .
I am also worried about what the effects on the environment of this area will be , such as traffic and noise pollution .
I would like to know the details of the plan .
Unless you do so and I agree the idea , I will not welcome the shopping center .
I would be very grateful if you replied me within ten days .
The climate in japan is usually very humid , but in this season , it 's even worse !
I wanna go somewhere where the weather is clearer .
I started writing a diaryo n lang - 8 , but the number of corrected times is only one . . .
Is there any trick to getting corrected by someone well ?
It would have been better if I had gotten a a premium membership . . .
My uncle is 39 years old .
I thought that that could happen only to other people ( ? ? )
And we went to the wedding place .
The wedding started at 11 .
After the wedding we took pictures .
Next , the traditional Korean wedding started .
Hello , everybody ! !
I took part in a performance which was made to welcome the freshmen .
The performance I danced in was about the `` 5 . 12 `` violent earthquake . It was about a teacher who saved her student at the last second , and the girl found the teacher in Heaven where they danced together , pushing the performance to its climax .
The play is a testimonial to the strong affection between the teacher and the little girl .
This picture is from the last scene .
I loved the dance !
It was my honor to participate in the performance , and I made friends with all of hte actors including the little girl , the teacher , and the other angels .
He is a famous Japanese baseball player and is currently a member of the Seattle Mariners .
When it comes to past admirable famous people , I think of Mother Teresa .
She dedicated herself to helping people who were poor or sick .
Her whole life can definitely teach them the significance of helping other people .
It is necessary for me to reply to emails in English .
But I know that my English is bad .
I 'm very stressed .
At work on the middle of the holidays .
I 'm at work now even though it 's the middle of the chusuk holidays .
My higher officer have been worried about any damage to the building and his men .
It 's very quiet and peaceful today except for the cloudy sky .
There seems to be no damage to our company .
Despite the fact , I have to be here because I was told that .
I originally planed to visit my relatives today . They live in Seoul , which is near my place .
I miss them . I wish I could have visited them today .
The only thing I can do is call them and say hello .
Whoever read this entry , might also be at work .
You however might spend your Wednesdays off of work .
That would be the difference between you and ( ? ) me .
I turned the radio on , and am listening to AFKN , a channel for the US army in Yongsan .
It 's in in English , so I do n't understand much , but it 's broadcasting a lot of good popsongs .
I totally enjoy that !
Have a nice day !
Recently , I have done some lessons using a computer .
I kept using the computer for a while this morning .
So my eyes are very tired .
It 's sunny today , I washed clothes . I hung out the clothes and a mattress .
Tomorrow , I will work because I have to finish a task that I have n't finished yet .
Today , I have supplement lectures .
Naturally today is a holiday .
I 'm a university student .
I 'm in my junior year of college .
I 'm bad at speaking foreign languages , but I like traveling abroad and I 'm interested in international communication .
I stayed in England for a month .
And I have visited Hawaii and South Korea .
I want to go on a trip !
( I wish I could write a good self introduction in English . )
I 'd like to try to dye my hair from brown to bronze ( I was born with black hair ) , apart from whether it suits me or not ^ ^
I wish bronze hair would suit me lol
One is that dying hair damages my hair , another is that bronze hair does n't suit me .
Although I like my natural hair color , black , I want to attempt to dye my hair .
I did n't write any English words for quite a long time since I left here .
But recently , I entered a law firm and started my career as a lawyer .
It is not easy for me to handle the partner 's assignment well .
For example , I draft some legal research titled `` Mining Investment in the Philippines `` .
I am interested in BBC TV series .
Is it a good idea to attend a subtitling group ?
So Dorayaki has Rabbit designs .
My eldest son ate a lot of Dorayaki like DORAEMON .
And I also like death such types of music as metal , grindcore and goregrind .
My dairy was lost due to the server being down after I clicked the `` submit `` button .
I have no way but re - write it , and it is now 11 : 30 PM which is late for me . . .
I finally finished the payroll calculation for August on time .
Oh , I forgot to introduce that I work in the human resource department , and have been since I graduated from college .
Currently there are more than 350 employees staffed in our facility , and for me , it takes at least 2 days to complete payroll calculation prior to submission each month .
There is an online HR system that was launched last year to facilitate the payroll process , improve accuracy and save time on mass data processing by updating basic personnel information , including but not limited to staff movement and salary adjustment .
I am going to save the above in Microsoft Word before posting .
Today , I went to the library to study English .
On the way to it , high school students were playing baseball in the stadium .
I watched it for a while because they seemed to enjoy it .
Thanks mom !
The radiation level in Tokyo is as usual according to measurement on the19th .
But Japanese government requested not to go ( ? ) forward .
I can only pray .
Rolling blackouts force us to stop work .
Today , I met the new staff member in our office .
Her face is so small !
It 's about one - third the size of mine . . .
I had a lunch with her and some other colleagues from our department to welcome her .
She has to get used to her new job as soon as possible ,
so I will have to help her .
Tomorrow , I will make a speech in morning meeting .
Now , I will go prepare for it . . .
My Grandfather 's House
The day before yesterday , I went to my grandfather 's house to stay with my friends .
My ( grand ? ) father 's home is in the suburb of Kang Won Do .
And sometimes my cell phone does n't work because there are so many mountains nearby .
Although it is a little inconvenient , there is clean air , water , and very beautiful scenery .
We had a good time .
But the next day , we could n't go home , because there was too much rain and the roads to Seoul were blocked .
Fortunately , we could go home once the rain stopped .
If the weather is good , I would like to go there again .
I really like the song `` Sing Sing `` the best .
Emmanuelle Seigner , a French actress , is the lead vocalist of the band .
The reason why I bought this CD was only her voice .
I saw a movie titled `` The Diving Bell and the Butterfly `` last week . The movie features their song `` Do n't Kiss Me Goodbye `` .
Today , the 146th TOEIC took place and I took it .
I marked all the answers , but I do n't know what score I will get .
For preparation , I practiced the exam and read grammar books , instead of writing journals .
I 'm not sure if I can get gain more accuracy for my grammar and my vocabulary through the exercise .
But I clearly understand that I need to improve my reading speed of English .
When I asked my English teacher questions about the test , he answered so fast , so quickly .
It was a bit strange for me , because these books were written in Japanese and they were reading Japanese more than English .
So , how will they be sucessful if they read Japanese ?
But newspapers in English have a much richer source of vocabulary .
Therefore , the TOEIC is just a turning point .
I want to improve this skill as much as I can !
I 'm tired now , so I 'll comment on my past journals .
Thank you for correcting my journals .
There are a lot of cherry blossoms
which symbolize spring time in Japan .
and I hope I 'll be able to write better English .
I hope to teach Japanese too .
Chatting is difficult for people more than what they think .
A book in which tips about chatting is written is very much sold in Japan .
I rarely go to Vancouver because it takes 4 hours from my town .
So I 'm always busy shopping when I stay there .
I definitely get a lot of Japanese books at `` Book Off `` .
I usually buy novels and I like all kinds of them For example , I like mystery , adventure , S .
Searching for books is really exciting . xD
I always enjoy looking for them .
I am living in Tokyo , Japan .
But I do n't watch Japanese dramas or anime .
Similarly , I am not familiar with J Rock .
Talking about music , I 'm more familiar with European and American music .
Because my diary got a lot of comments !
It is difficult to study English composition myself / alone .
So Lang - 8 is great ! ! ! ! Or `` useful ``
I will do my best to study English ! !
I write this diary in English for the first time .
I have been studying English since the elementary school .
However , it is I was not good at it .
I think that I worked really hard .
I went to the hair salon for a hair cut yesterday .
I had 3 photos of Ringo Sina , and so I made a request to the beauty artist .
`` Can you cut my hair to look like her ? `` .
He looked at her photos many times , and then he was cutting my hair .
His salon is small , but he has a good technique .
And when my hair cut was finished , I looked at my hair in the mirror .
My heart and my hair felt lighter .
About 90 people were killed .
Why did he attack innocent people ?
I do n't know what he was thinking .
Can people own a gun in Norway ?
If there were no guns , there would n't be any terrorist attacks .
I think guns are unnecessary .
In Japan , obesity is a big issue for adults .
Of course , It 's a big issue for me .
Usually I go to the gym to keep in good shape ,
but my weight still stays the same .
My friend told me to run , do sit - ups and abdominal exercises
So I just now started doing them .
I 've been exercising that way for three days .
By next summer , I ' d like to show off my firm muscles .
I tried to challenge many times .
My job is to mak games and web site .
Therefore , I like Japanese - manga and video games .
I like to listen to music and go for a walk too .
I will play a video game with xbox today .
And , I am thinking to go for a walk .
I want to write everyday , but sometimes I do n't know what to write . Other times , when I start to write , I do n't know how to say something and I do n't finish it .
I think I need to study more and learn more vocabulary .
I usually watch films and series in English with subtitles .
Now I am watching Lost , and I think I could understand most of it without subs .
I am tired , so I am going to have dinner and watch one Lost episode before I go to bed .
I have one question though , what is it the difference between a `` town `` and a `` city `` ?
I have been a little busy and I have not written nor corrected much lately .
I 've just started using Lang - 8 . I want to study English and French .
I 'm looking forward to experiencing Lang - 8 !
See You Next Year !
My Floridian friend returned to his country .
I really really miss him .
When I looked at the things that he had used in my house , I remembered him .
There are too many memories in my house .
When I saw his green sandals that he left in my house , I cried and thought about him .
It 's hard on me also .
Thanks Zac for the 2 months we had together .
I would love to tell him : Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart .
I like sharing my life with them .
Now they chat with me online on QQ .
I hope I make more friends on Lang - 8 .
Some persons have gone to other section and someone has come to my former section .
I am the one of the persons who has gone .
However people who are still in the section are talking about me and send me e - mails .
I thank my former colleagues .
I was and am supported by a lot of people .
I want to make an animation using very few dialogues .
I want to make an animation using very few dialogues , because I want to make world - class productions .
I know it 's difficult to do , but I will keep trying it .
I read an article in a newspaper about the Japanese economy two days ago .
As you already know , Japan became the super aging society , and old people who will retire a few years later are very desperate to protect their positions in their own companies .
For old people , young job applicants and workers are just nuisance , because If young workers enter a company , the company may fire old workers who have been taking good pay for a long time .
Older workers are afraid of it .
So sometimes old workers bully young workers until new workers qui .
Old people always dare to give us useless lectures , like `` Contemporary young people do n't make efforts at all `` and `` They want to get only high standard jobs , there are many jobs they can do , even though payments are not good , why are their ideal so high ? `` . Maybe they have never read job advertisements at all .
They do n't have dicks and bowls . > > balls ?
Thank you for your advice on my PC .
I have n't investigated it closely yet .
It has ended up on the back - burner .
It might be the same as when some people postpone going to the hospital when they do n't feel well because of busyness .
In my previous entry , I asked about [ the difference between ] `` to persuade `` and `` to convince . ``
Thanks to all of your explanations , I understood the difference well .
So we need to win our boss over another way .
I will take an English lesson at Turry 's coffee shop today .
It is the second time .
I do n't use any text book or dictionary .
We talk about anyth topics .
I found the teacher on a website called `` my sensei .
My teacher is a 28 year old woman .
She is nice to me .
But , it costs 4800 per hour .
Wow , I have to draw money from bank ! ! ! !
I got ta go !
Ego and Other People
I said to him , `` Can I help you ? `` or `` What are you looking for ? ``
At the welcome party , he told me that he was surprised that I gave him a hand .
I am not sure that I completely understood what he told me , but I would like to summarize what he said .
They value autonomy .
They do not give a hand to another person without being asked .
They think that he does not need help if he does n't say anything .
These are common ways of thinking in Japan .
I tried to help him in the Japanese way .
This was culture shock for me .
It has been a while already since I became uncertain of orchestra conducting , but today I learned something .
Maybe it will be a breakthrough .
A tangled thread in my head may be unraveled .
I found myself feeling excited in the train back to Tokyo .
Whether I can get hold of it or not depends on how I spend everyday .
When I woke up , I felt extremely good .
I think it 's because I went to bed early .
We went there to help my parents ' work .
Though it was a little bit hard work , we enjoyed helping them out .
I guess I can sleep tight tonight and feel much better tomorrow .
Yesterday , I donated my blood , hoping it could save someone 's life , for the first time in the year 2011 .
The Japanese Constitution allows anyone whose age is over 16 to donate200cc of blood .
I will give her a surprise at Christmas .
Last night our teacher talked about the Dream of Red Mansion with us .
This novel was one of the most famous novels written by Cao XueQin who lived in Qin Dynasty .
This novel now has several versions .
However , I think that the first version is the most popular .
Recently , another director made another version .
This one is like a nightmare .
The make up and music was very horrible like a ghost film .
The actors and actresses are very young so they do n't know how to perform this tv show .
The dialogue is almost repeated exactly from the novel .
There are many voice overs through out the tv show .
I need to prepare for an exam related to my work which I 'm going to take next week .
I also want to make more time for learning English , but I ca n't manage to do both of them .
I wish I could be a little better at multi - tasking .
I graduated from driving school last week .
I want to get my license soon !
I 'm interested in japanese and korean culture .
I love anime and manga .
I think Japan should focus more on relations with other nations for several reasons .
Secondly , among Asian nations , Japan is the only advanced nation , so Japan should show other nations how to deal with international relations with European nations and the United States .
Japanese people are hard - working and our politicians and diplomats have had good relations with the United Stated and European nations .
One was that Japan should focus more on relations with other Asian nations because Japan should take a role as a leading nation among Asian countries .
The other reason was that Japan knows a lot about relations with European nations and America , so we should use the advantage to communicate and have a good relationship with other nations .
My desk in my office is usually much neater than most of my colleagues ' desks .
However a lot of ( hardcopy ) documents have been piling up on my desk and the drawer is / has become full of them recently .
I decided to take some time to check whether the documents were really necessary for me or not .
To my surprise , the result was that I could reduce the pile to one fifth its original amount .
If you have some trouble in your work [ at your job ] , I recommend that you clean your desk .
I do not know how to memorize English .
. Firstly , I want to learn basic conversational English .
How should I start studying ?
I went to view cherry blossoms with my wife last Sunday .
We bought some coffee and cake .
We enjoyed eating cake and drinking coffee under the Cherry Blossoms beside the river side .
Everyone enjoyed cooking BBQ and playing light sports .
I had a relaxing time .
came to the branch
Today it is a holiday and the weather 's nice .
If I had plans , I think I would go to somewhere , but . . . . . ! !
I did n't have plans today . so , I woke up at 11 : 00 . then I ate lunch , watched a DVD and played ukulele .
If it 's a nice day tomorrow , I will go ( out ) somewhere !
What a bother !
That remains me , I have to finish my homework by the day after tomorrow .
Could you please teach me the reason in detail .
I found that I 've been writing my journal in English for around 70 days .
I want to express my ideas or my feelings in English more and more .
Before writing a journal , I did n't pay attention to nouns .
Though there are two kinds of nouns ( one is a countable noun , the other is an uncountable noun ) in English , we do n't have such ideas in Japanese .
I especially do n't understand abstract nouns .
On the other hand , I tend to think how I express Japanese phrases in English every day .
For example , while I talk with my friend , I think of how I can express this feeling in English .
Then , when I talk with my English teacher , I often replied with two or three words before , but I tend to be able to reply with complete sentences which I made , even though my completesentences are wrong in most cases .
However , if I keep practicing these things , I will be able to master English someday .
Therefore , I think keeping a diary is one of the best ways indeed .
I have been jogging for an hour almost every night for three months .
Though McDougall recommended running using low - cushion shoes in this book , I think there is a risk for beginners to hurt their foot .
Actually , I hurt my feet using Vibram FiveFingers shoes .
So , although I do n't know if I can run the whole distance , I decided to try a full marathon in April and an ultramarathon in June .
The tree - planting ceremony was held near where I live .
It was a very big ceremony there ,
because the Emperor and Empress came to plant trees by themselves .
There are many roads that had been repaired , re - paved or newly made around and towards the park where the ceremony was held , to prepare for the ceremony .
The Emperor and Empress planted seeds and various kinds of tree saplings , including pollen - less cedars .
It was pity that it rained all the time during the ceremony , but many other attractions were there , like some dances , reading some essays , etc .
We wish the trees will grow up healthily , and that we will keep the mountains and nature beautiful .
This is my first diary .
I got together with my friends to have an OKONOMIYAKI party today .
Okonomiyaki , which looks like a pancake , is a kind of local food in Japan .
We enjoyed eating them and talking .
In addition , we watched JUDO in the olympics .
It was pity that the Japanese player could n't win a first prize .
Each country 's national debt breeds distrust of the world economy after the crisis in Greece .
After Lehman 's fall , the global depression has necessitated fiscal action , so it seems natural that the debts are growing large .
In addition , Japan keeps current - account surplus , so Japan might be considered to be relatively stable .
Without good prospect for rapid improvement of each country 's current account , the crisis / threat ? of default seems to get more serious , and I think the crucial period is yet to come .
I logged into this site Lang - 8 for the first time .
Because my English tutor gave me this URL .
I will try to write my diary in English starting from today . . . !
`` You will go to a far place You do n't know where it is nor how far .
You can take five animals there .
But you ca n't take all the animals all the way .
You have to leave an animal on the way .
When you go a short distance , you 'll have to leave an animal again .
Which animal will you leave 1st ?
What about the 2nd , 3rd , 4th ?
What about the last one ?
Have you decided ?
The `` far place `` is your life 's journey .
Each animal has a meaning as follows .
Which animal did you leave 1st ?
Which animal was last ?
Please think about your decisions and your reasons .
# This is the test I heard today .
I hope you can get understand , even though my English is poor . . .
I have come here recently and consequently do not know many English words .
The dentist attached metal fittings to my teeth .
He said my teeth will ache a few hours later , and I ca n't eat breakfast the next morning because of the pain .
What is a saddest thing for me is that I will not be able to eat rice cakes .
I had stand it for two years already !
I 'm sleepy this morning .
It 's raining . The weather reports are calling for a `` Guerrilla downpour `` .
We had a dinner after that .
I enjoyed it but my body hurts now .
I was shocked by how many things I have to know .
I have ( get ) the feeling ( that ) I 'll either pass or fai this exam by a very slim margin .
If I can find time to complain about how difficult this is , surely I can find the time to study just one more page .
It 's such a busy day .
I rarely have time to write anything .
Respect for senior citizens day
Today is a national holiday , `` respect for senior citizens `` day .
Before legal changes , this day was on the 15th of September .
Now , we have a three - day weekend .
We call this day `` Happy Monday `` .
My summer vacation has finished . . . .
no wait , my summer vacation finishes today .
now summer is gone , the next season is fall .
What do you think of when you hear the season of fall ?
I recall good food and books ^ ^ *
I love eating delicious food and reading interesting books !
I think about sport . . . .
I dislike sports , because I am not very good at them .
It is good taste . It taste good .
But , I am feeling just a little . sleepy
These days , I often read sports news on the internet .
The newspaper is called dailymail .
There are few Japanese soccer players on the England soccer team .
I spent the day studying English so I needed to move my body .
Having finished reading aloud while training , I took a walk .
The goal for Walking in Japan is 9200 steps for men and 8300 steps for women .
I do n't know how many steps I took today
but my grandmother takes about 2000 steps in 20 minute walks
I think I took not less than 6000 steps .
Adding 3200 steps can make me reach that goal .
I 'll dosome walking every day from today on
Here , is today 's diary .
The plate is to prevent overheating during the summer .
I am really grateful to them .
I was planning to study English after work , but a friend asked me for my help , which took an hour .
After that , I just talked with some friends , another waste of time , oops !
I learned the expression , `` in vain `` from the radio . lol , hmm , I noticed ( or / see ) many people like using it .
I told a friend to come here to learn English . She is hungarian . I met her last year at red universe ( ff0000 . com ) , which is a flash website where people can talk ( to eachother ) .
It is a very funny place , and I have met many friends there , wish you guys would like it .
But I lost my job . I had worked as an assistant to a cameraman . The boss had planned to rent a basement of about 1000 square meters .
When he was about to pay for the rent , the landlord took it back .
So , I became the excess person , and left .
I went back shanghai .
I have a steady job at present .
The day has just gone like water .
A friend told me she wants to go abroad to study .
She does n't like an unchanging everyday existence .
I want to do that too , alright now I have two plans .
I downloaded some white brich songs .
I love this kind of weather
These days the weather has become cooler than before .
The reason is because it 's cold in the North ( so we , people who live in the South , can feel the cold from there - I do n't know how to write this sentence ) and it 's also the end of November , so it 's nearly Christmas .
If I did n't have to go to work I 'm sure I would be sitting in a coffee shop , drinking my favourite coffee and chatting with my friends now .
I want to go back to the times when I was still a student and I could stay in bed longer when it was cold or could go out with my friends on a beautiful day like this .
I miss those days .
Because it 's cold I have to wear a thin coat when I go out ( I usually just wear it when it 's hot ) , ah I should buy a new coat .
Time to relax ! = ) I just arrived home . . .
I must do my English homework , because I will go to my English teacher on Friday . I am going to go for a walk with my friends now . Everybody good night !
Hello !
I 'm studying for an entrance exam that 's on next Friday .
After I enter college , I want to study English more .
Please correct my writing .
Parents should n't show their bad habits or behaviors in front of their children .
This is because children tend to quickly imitate what occurs in front of them .
If a parent littered , their child would simply think that it is n't wrong , and he or she would rapidly imitate this bad behavior .
This is bad .
Furthermore , once children fall into a bad habit , it is difficult for them to change .
Today I went to driving school , because . . . .
driving school , because I want a driving licence .
Today I did the practical skill test and passed .
I want a driving licence as soon as possible .
Today I changed display to show photos of my girl friend 's and my mom saw it .
She was just surprised because my girl friend is prettier than she expected .
Well indeed I thought I 'm just as good - looking as she is . . . , just decided to let it go .
By the way , starting yesterday , I 'm doing what I can for her here .
My ideas are to write a diary here and to send voice mail to her by email .
In fact , I 'm not sure how long I can continue this since I 'm very lazy person and easily get tired but I 'll try .
I bought a skirt , a T - shirt , and a knit .
I wanted to buy a backpac and shoes .
But I could n't find one which I loved .
Today was so nice day !
An 8 . 9 magnitude earthquake hit Japan followed by a tsunami .
I just saw a lot of Facebook friends who keep sharing the video of that Japan tsunami .
Hope they will be fine and safe .
Caution for neighbouring countries .
The tsunami might reach you .
I went to my home town
But my friend from Aichi came to Fukuoka .
I guided them around Fukuoka and now have sent them home .
July is terrible to the Chinese .
There are a lot of ghosts .
People will worship ghosts . ( Really ? )
But the lunar calendar in July is important to Buddhism .
I 'm both happy and worried .
I 'm happy because I ( ? ) have a lot of food .
I am worried . . .
because I am afraid of ghosts .
Hi , I went shopping at Shibuya .
I bought some clothes and shoes .
In May , I will go to China for school travel .
We plan to communicate with people there in English .
I will do my best !
Hi , it 's very nice here today .
I took a walk with my dog around the area .
This is picture of us walking together .
He is a traditional Japanese dog , a Shiba - inu .
Shiba is the most popular breed of dog in Japan , and I hear it 's getting popular in the US and in other countries as well .
But the most common color for Shiba is brown , so my dog 's color ca n't be seen clearly . . .
I 'll talk about him in detail next time .
Preparing to study abroad
A big change in my life is coming soon .
Tomorrow , I will go Canada to study for 8 months .
I must select what I leave at home .
If possible , please give me any advice because I ca n't decide how to select due to insufficient info ( rmation ) .
I `` m beat , because I have been caught up in some problems at work recently .
On days like this , I should read some funny comics or something before going to bed , and think about those problems tomorrow .
I 'll probably be able to work it all out somehow .
The chlorophyll of my heart . . .
It means that is a precious person for me .
In case of plants , the chlorophyll is very important for the plants ' growth .
In a nutshell , the chlorophyll is absolutely needed by plants .
I want to find a woman who is like the chlorophyll .
She will make me so happy , and I will also make her happy .
Whoever that person maybe , to have the existence such like the chlorophyll . . .
Of course , I do not know that person yet .
Anyway I 'm going to bed ! ! !
My name is Lov .
I still ca n't write English very well , so if you have some free time , please teach me my mistakes in my diary .
' Inundate ' is to be attacked by water ( or flooded ) .
Just ten years ago in 1998 , we were amidst the years called later `` Lost Ten Years `` .
In the summer of the year , prime minister Keizo Obuchi , who had just been inaugurated , performed in front of a fruit and vegetable store .
I think many remember that .
The chain reaction of falling stock prices ravaged the world market again , even though we thought it was over .
The prices in the Tokyo market experienced the second highest rate of decline in the wake of the plunge in New York ( stock market ) .
According to estimates of a private research institute , the value of individual shares and investment trust funds had gone down by about 100 trillion yen between the end of June last year and the end of September this year .
This is unforgivable to the people who have invested their savings for their post - retirement years .
According to stock traders , the plunge in New York market last week is because of the anxiety about the U . S .
financial system , but the one this week is because of the clearer tendency of the recession .
If the actual economy in the US
is really aggravated , it is very dire for Japan , which depends mainly on exports .
Though there was a brief recovery from `` Lost Ten Years `` , it is said that economy in Japan is also in a stage of recession .
I hear government and the parties in power have begun to study instituting additional economic policies .
People want effective policies not lip service .
I think true autumn has come at last .
When I read this book , I thought that my vocabulary of English is low level .
I repeatedly consulted an English - Japanese dictionary .
This book 's pictures are very pretty .
I enjoyed reading this book , but I thought that I want to study English very hard .
Once you use a Mac you can not go back to Windows PCs , because a Mac is useful , smart and so cool .
Touch pads on Mac laptops recognize the number of fingers on it .
If you have an iPhone I strongly recommend you to buy a Mac .
This was because an event was held there .
My first journal on Lang - 8 .
But there is no time to use my English in daily life .
So , on Lang - 8 , I want to communicate with native English speakers and improve my English skills ! !
I can teach you my native language , Japanese , too !
I hope I have time to meet all kinds of people here on Lang - 8 .
According to my experience , the rainy season might end before the middle of July . . .
I hope it will end before the 3 day week - ends !
What will I be doing during the holidays ?
I 'll have to think about it : )
Now , I 'm eating spaghetti for dinner .
I cooked it myself .
First , I boiled the noodles for six minutes .
Then , I mixed the noodles with tuna .
Finally , I poured soy source over the noodles and dusted it with a piece of dried bonito .
`` Japanese noodles `` are finished !
It 's very delicious .
As I commented on my diary from March 27 , a magazine reporter and a photographer came to our gym and got a story .
Finally , I bought the magazine today !
Please check out my Japanese blog if you have an interest in either Kendo , music or Japanese life .
Today we went to city hall ( the Industial Cultural Center ) for the environmental ecology nomination event .
We are an enviromentally conscious family !
I could not believe that I received the nomination .
Today was very exciting and enjoyable .
I 'm a soft spoken person , and sometimes people ca n't hear me , especially in noisy places .
There are tips and advice for people who have the same problem . ( It sounds okay without adding anything . You could also say : `` people who have the same problem I do . `` )
Smoke a pack of cigarettes everyday , yell all the time . . . .
Yesterday , I went to a Noraebang ( a room for singing in S .
Korea , a little different from karaoke in Japan ) to feel better .
These days , I have been a bit depressed .
My English does n't seem to get better , especially in speaking , and I also felt bad when my favorite english teacher kept saying ' I ca n't hear you . ' last class .
When I sang songs there , I realized that my voice is not quiet ( basically / naturally ) , just I usually talk quiet .
I will try to speak louder as much as possible .
I may feel like I 'm yelling , but I also noticed that it is not when I recorded and heard my voice .
I hope you enjoy good food and have fun on Thanksgiving Day !
In my spare time , I often rent some comedies , not only the new ones , but also the old classic movies .
Especially during those times when I encounter a sad or unhappy thing , I would like to watch a comedy .
And then I would forget those annoyances , and become happy .
We watch comedy not just for fun , but also to get some life philosophy .
There is much we can learn from him - - not only from his movies , but also from the person himself .
I have been working for exactly one year now .
Since I started working , I have discovered a few disadvantages / weaknesses in myself .
I made some mistakes during the process of work and felt unhappy about it at the time .
Actually , I care about so many things regarding my work .
I do n't know why I care so much .
I did n't know I had these kinds of weaknesses when I was a student .
By the way , it 's very different between the part time and the full time job , so I do n't have any presumptions at work anymore .
Any opportunities for working are good , so try and see which one might be suitable for you .
It was raining , so I went to the nearest station in my car , after I took my son to kindergarten .
( Usually , I go there with my bike to exercise . )
I had expected there would be only me in this lesson , but another trainer was there .
She went there from another city where this lesson was held before .
according to her , It took about 40 minutes with a limited express train .
Before the begin of the lesson , we chatted some .
We spoke about our life .
She entered at the high school in Australia , she graduated and then entered at the college there .
After she came back in Japan , she worked in a hotel .
Once I used to work in the hotel 's staff . )
about the lesson , it was challenging , but rewarding , like the last time .
; D We have to learn the teaching methods in a short time and do a lots of homeworks every time .
There are 24 hours in a day . . . .
Well , I should n't neglect my routine of English study , so I can refresh my English skills .
I went to the Beijing Museum of Natural History today and it was very exciting .
Apparently , it is popular with kids , but I think it is also a good place for adults to learn more about Mother Nature .
Scientists found that in the last fifty years of twentieth century , hundreds of thousands of species had become extinct on earth .
As a result , when scientists studied the six mass extinctions of organisms in natural history , they found surprisingly that the earth is experiencing the seventh mass extinction of organisms right now .
Features of The Seventh Mass Extinction of Organisms
The past six mass extinctions all happened over thousands or millions of years ago , whereas the current rate of species extinction , according to calculations , is much greater compared to before .
The extinction of modern organisms is due to human 's activities .
Humans are the only species that can cause the mass extinctions of other species in the history of life .
People 's economic activities like the over - exploiting of forests and excess reclamation lead to the changing of environment of other species .
Pollution from human activities endanger the survival of wildlife .
Because of the population explosion , people are competing with animals for resources , which also results in their extinction .
Starting yesterday , I am now in the test weeks , so I have to study for a test I will take at school .
So I am too busy to update my diary . . .
We had a meeting with our big client in their office today .
It was my first time there .
They have a big building in Yotuya of Tokyo and they own all of the floors .
I 've been working for more than 10 hours today !
but I keep on studying English !
I 've decided to stay awake for as long as possible .
I washed my sister 's car .
It was very dirty because no one has driven the car for at least one month .
It is now clean .
If I could have dinner with any famous person , I would choose Dr .
He is a Japanese doctor , photographer and a professional of international cooperation .
After he gained experience in a medical NGO in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan , he set up the NPO `` Earth the Spaceship `` .
He acted in a positive manner to increase the number of people who became interested in global cooperation .
I 've read all of his books ? and I felt he showed me concepts that helped guide my life .
So , I want to talk with him about global dynamics , human life and so on at a drinking spot over a light meal .
atashi wa nihongo no benkyou wo gambarimasu .
Route guidance
Well , go straight until you reach the first signal and turn left , then you will find a subway entrance .
Then go to Ueno station with Hibiya line and change train to Ginza line there .
Finally , go to Toranomon station and walk towards a big hospital called toranomon hospital .
I 'm sorry I 'm not so familiar with this place .
Could you ask another person when you get close ?
I 'll try to face and solve the problem , Note : Capital I
He will quit his job at our office at the end of March .
He is leaving for another job .
He and I have been at the same group for about five years , since 2005 .
He was our group leader .
Therefore , I was shocked and felt somewhat betrayed when I heard the news of his change of job .
But it is also true that I respect him a lot as a good engineer and I like him as a good elder friend .
Anyway , we will miss him .
Although I work hard everyday just like the main character ,
I wonder if I 'm gaining experience for my future .
In the end , she was promoted and got a nice boyfriend in the movie .
I know that real life does n't go as great as a movie .
However , I think of my life and I do my best .
or maybe I write all posts correctly ? ) ) I dont think so ) )
I wanna meet foreigners and make friends .
And learn new languages between us all .
My First Diary ! !
Now I am studying English sicnce I go to America next month .
I 'm very excited but
I 'm worried if I can speak English .
So I am studying English now .
My friend told me about this site .
Well , I go to America with my friend and we will stay for one month .
I went there once when I was in high school .
At that time , I was 17 years old .
My friend and I stayed with our host family and we had a very good time .
I appreciated my host family since I had very good time . I came to like America more .
This time , I want to go to visit my host family and tell about my life after that .
Anyway I use this site about for month to improve my English .
I am glad if anyone corrects my diary .
It told me that I can use this website to practise my writing .
I have n't written in my dairy for a long time .
Since I had a cold I did n't get up early .
I 've been waking up at 6 in the morning recently .
Today I helped someone to get their property back .
It was on a table where people eat foods .
Someone forgot that bank book .
Because I saw the company name inside that book .
I went to the bank and returned the book .
I am happy that I could help people today .
Today , I went to the Job Search Centre with the necessary documents .
I woke so early and it was even before my alarm clock rang ( went off ) .
Recently I always woke in the middle of the night .
Since it was too early , I laid down again .
The Centre is about ten - minute 's walk from the nearest station .
There were some people waiting for their turn , so I picked up a reception sheet and waited for my turn .
After the reception ( consultation ? ) I got an introduction card for my application for a new job .
It is the job of a receptionist at a hotel in Asakusa which is far from my apartment .
I will receive a call on whether they plan to have an interview with me .
They will make the decision if they are going to employ ( hire ) me .
I am old and only had a few good jobs in my career .
So it is difficult to get a new job but I must not lose hope .
I want to improve my English writing .
I 'm a student in the beijing .
but I want to learn about english . english is very good .
because I will go study abroad .
so , I hope that everyone will help me with my english .
I 've studied English for so long that I can listen and understand what native speakers say .
But I have to admit , I ca n't speak well enough .
I want to reach the level where I can make a good presentation in front of an audience .
Sometimes I become desperate and feel that nobody can achieve that level unless you lived in other countries when you were young .
But that idea is wrong .
I came to that conclusion when I saw a presentation by a president of a company .
He graduated from an American business school .
But he had n't been to the US before business school .
He did an excellent presentation about his expertise and his business .
He answered all the questions with a sense of humor .
Now I believe that I can be a good English speaker someday if I keep studying .
Chopsticks are a famous Asian traditional tool for eating .
The are made of wood .
Should not ( spear the food ? ) .
I 've lived in Japan since I was born , but it is difficult for me to pick up food as small as a soybean .
I think it is necessary that I should practice more .
This news program uses easier English than `` abc NEWS `` .
Do you know about it ?
These must have reflected themselves in her feelings .
I 'm going to go to the Tokyo for the All Japan JHS chorus competition , so I will leave my house early in the morning .
I will arrive noon and go to the NHK concert hall .
After All Japan JHS chorus competition , I want to have fun with my friends .
The question I often want to ask a foreigner
What causes a person to leave his hometown and go to a place where even the language is different ?
Many answers would probably be to learn a new language .
But it must take a lot of courage .
If your friend is going to a new country , what advice will you give to him or her ? like experience or somethng else
I just became a member of this site .
I am a totally newbie , like a baby deer trying to get up on his feet
so spank me up ( ? ) to become a good English writer .
Please correct them if they are very wrong , or if there is a better way to say it .
I hope I get used to this sooner . . .
but is this correct ?
Here 's another question .
Christmas is over
Now Christmas is over and I feel relief .
I got married to a Canadian guy .
Anyway Christmas is over . . .
As you know , there have been many earthquakes in Japan .
In the Tohoku region , people have been suffering from disease , and shortage of food and water , because of the tsunami and the earthquake .
However , I live in Kanagawa perfecture , which is far from Tohoku region .
Therefore , I can support people in the region only by donation and saving power .
I feel I 'm powerless .
So , I think they are also suffering .
I tried to get in touch with them over and over , but I couldn ` t .
I 'm very worried about my relatives .
As I ca n't get in touch with them , all I have to do is to pray that they are alive and healthy .
We entered the big graveyard and the pitch - dark tunnel one pair at a time on a dare .
We walked the sandy beach on the way .
I like the sea at night .
The moon and stars that night were very beautiful .
The moon was bright , so we were n't in the dark .
So the test of courage did n't scare me .
Because I just registered on Lang - 8 .
I think this is a really nice web - site for learning languages .
I wanted to find out more about this before .
by the way , will someone really correct my diary ?
Today , a famous Japanese actress was placed on the wanted list .
Her name is `` Noripi `` . She is 38 years old .
Two days ago , another famous actor , `` Oshio manabu `` , was ( also ) arrested as a suspect .
A lot of people feel sad about that , but others ( or : but other people ) feel amused .
Who will catch her . . .
I carry it with me all the time .
I look up a lot of words when I 'm on duty or studying every day .
It always helps me and it 's a necessity for me .
Oh , it 's a big problem .
I suppose , I used it too much , or it has just reached the end of its life .
Have you ever heard of it ?
It is very famous in Japan .
I play basketball , so I can empathise with characters .
You can enjoy it even without a knowledge of basketball .
[ Taiwan was a ] ffected by the outer band of Typhoon `` Parma `` , Taiwan had a lot of rain over the weekend .
It has been raining for 3 days in a row .
Instead of a drizzle , it 's torrential rain .
The sound of the rain hitting the eaves woke me up in the middle of the night several times .
And the most important fact is that my clothes have not dried yet .
I have to submit a plan for my thesis by the end of May .
But I 'm still wondering what theme I should choose .
I started using this because I want to improve my English .
First , I want to introduce myself .
I 'm a university student majoring in English and American literature , so I 'm interested in learning about other countries .
My dream is to visit many countries and to talk with many people there .
My favorite musicisians are NEWS , Tegomass , Demi Lovato , and so on .
My favorite movies are Harry Potter , Twilight , and so on .
I love movies so I belong to the movie - making club .
I am a student from Colombia and I 'm trying to learn English with this page , can someone help me
Beauty and the Beast - Chapter One
Once , there was rich merchant in a big town .
The two elder daughters were ugly and greedy ,
but the youngest daughter was different .
Everything about her was beautiful .
But , Beauty was still thankful for everything .
They family had to work .
So , he went to the port ,
but soon learned the last ship was robbed by pirates .
5 / 11 / 2010 .
I got the job and started to work after the interview .
I work with an art designer in an office .
He is an easy going person .
It is busy , and I have to learn many things .
I also have to practice the design software `` Illustrator `` more . + Adobe Illustrator ? +
I work from 10 : 00am to 5 : 00pm , then I go to school after work .
I feel very tired , and I ca n't concentrate on my book .
Next week we will start to prepare for the mid - term exam .
And I also wish to have more time to practice `` salsa `` dancing .
I hope everything will go smoothly in the future .
Today , I watched a movie , `` October Sky . ``
The movie 's main character is a boy called Homer .
The boy was born and raised in a coal - mining town .
He has a dream , to be a rocket scientist , and in the end he does .
The boy 's biggestobstacleis his father .
But Homer chose his own life , not his father 's .
It 's an interesting movie .
A few days ago , I watched `` Forrest Gump `` , which I had borrowed from a rental shop .
I wo n't describe the details of this film , because if you have never watched it I want you to watch it .
I have been taking a voice training lesson since 2009 .
I belong to the Marketing division at work , so I often make a presentation
to promote the sales of our products .
In Japan , most people tend to like a high pitched voice , but I did n't have that .
For an attractive presentation , I thought it was important to be able to make a speech with a clear voice .
That is why I started to take training .
Now , many different audiences praise my presentations .
I was totally put out when I got out of my last lab class on Friday .
When my class was over , I was chatting on Facebook with my friend and suddenly one of the my classmates came to me and started shouting and crying .
I searched BBC news and it was unbelievable . Oh God , what you have done ?
Then I realized that God has always cursed people .
If he did n't want the living beings then why did he create all of us to see this type of event . I am totally angry with God .
I know some people do bad things , but some are helpful to others .
Where is God ? I do n't believe he is very kind to the creatures he created .
Oh , God , I humbly request that you please stop these fearful , dreadful things . Do n't cruse your son if you are really a God .
No father will ever want his son to be troubled . Then why are you so unkind ?
If we make a little mistake , give us a little punishment . But the people of japan are so kind and laborious , you ca n't explain .
I felt that I gained ground vitality when I exercised to strengthen the abdominal muscles .
Just my feeling .
I wonder if my body will be straight .
I think there are many mistakes in grammar , I would appreciate it if you could point out my mistake .
I 'm completely broke since I arrived in Japan .
I should n't have gone traveling in Australia with my friend if I want to save some money but of course I could n't do that .
It 's our first and possibly last time to travel there .
I do n't know what will happen in the future [ ? ] , so I chose to use the money .
It was the right decision .
Our trip was such an exciting , special time for us .
I used to work in a hotel in Osaka before I went to Australia .
I want to use English in my job .
I 'll do my best , please cross your fingers for me ; )
If children get more outdoor play and contact many bacteria , they might avoid allergic disease .
Furthermore , there are several reports that some foods containing bacteria work well with our body .
For example , yogurt containing lactic acid bacteria is believed to make us healthy and prevent disease , because these bacteria strengthen the immune system .
However , it is still unclear how much the probiotics affect the immune system and prevent the disease .
Our environments including our body already have many bacteria and we are exposed to them all time .
The most of data demonstating the benefits to our body are clamed by companies producing fermented foods .
There are research conflicts and we need much more fair studies .
First Diary

I hope Japan rebuilds after the earthquake as soon as possible .
sea otters
In an aquarium , they do n't have to be worried about being carried away .
However , they may not feel at ease unless they catch something in their sleep .
Sea otters that live in aquariums sometimes sleep hand in hand .
My wife said that the baby inside her had a lot of hiccups yesterday .
It lasted for about one minute .
She said maybe he was trying to practice breathing before birth .
How often do you hiccup ?
Today 's dinner .
I cooked fried chicken and salada this evening .
Fried chicken is called `` Karaage `` in Japanese .
Its the most popular food and young people love it .
I never heard people say `` I dislike Karaage `` .
We can buy it at the convenience shop , supermarket , restaurant and so on .
Of course , I love it .
Yesterday , I was on Skype with my school friends .
There is n't any class .
I enjoyed that time .
I will work hard to study English
Have you ever seen your clock when it shows `` 12 : 12 `` ?
People say that seeing these kind of numbers ( double numbers ) will bring you good luck !
I do n't know if this is true or false because I see that kind of numbers all the time ! !
I feel very cold .
I dropped by a bookstore after work today .
I wanted to get a fashion magazine but I remembered that I forgot my purse .
I 'll go there again tomorrow .
And I stayed a month on a homestay .
So I was very comfortable , and I enjoyed my stay / my trip / etc . .
I came back to Korea and wanted to call them .
. . . because I lost their e - mail address .
But I 'm having a little trouble .
I want be sure to call them before ( more / too much ) time passes .
My friend got married ! !
My friend got married last May .
That friend is the same age as me ( 22 years old ) , so I was a little surprised .

Thank you for your prompt reply .
ETS is the most efficient institution I have ever seen .
I deeply appreciate that you taken the time to consider my problem .
But Ihave one more question about the process of changing my name .
My situation is that I did n't know ( that ) I had made a mistake on my name until the staff of the test center told me , which was just before the test began .
So my question is the following :
`` Is the test center obligated to report to ETS if they discover an inconsistency between the registered name and the name on the student 's passport ? ``
I ask this question because I have some friends who had also made a similar mistake on their name , however , the staff of the test center helped them report it to ETS .
Eventually , all of them had their names corrected successfully !
( Okay , let 's get / ) Going back to my question .
If your answer is `` YES `` , then I could seek damages from the test center where I took the test .
( Because of / ) Due to their negligence , I had spent USD160 and got nothing !
My TOEFL score is invalid becaus they did n't have my name corrected !
If your answer is `` NO `` , then I will have doubts on the reliability of ETS .
In other words , anyone could have replaced me to take the test .
The staff at the test center knew that there was a mistake on my name , but they still let me to take the test .
I am just a poor student who wants to study abroad .
I only earn USD350 per month , and the test cost me almost half my salary .
All I want is fair treatment .
I know it was my own mistake to begin with .
But there are others who have made the same mistakes and then had their names / mistakes corrected .
They and I have the same problem but we end up with different consequences .
Thank you again for your prompt reply .
It is really appreciated .
Yours sincerely ,
In the middle of the night I woken up by a terrible sound .

I often have had nightmares since we broke up .
Therefore , I am tired at work .
How long will this condition continue ?
Yesterday and the day before , I played in a band .
The song I played was `` HEAVEN `` ( Janne da arc ) , `` God knows `` and `` Empty color days `` .
After I read an article titled `` Are you happy with life ? `` in a newsgroup .
I asked myself .
I do n't really know whether I am happy or not .
Sometimes , I would like more pretty clothes even though I have have so many clothes already .
My mother always scolds me , `` Why do you buy so many clothes , but never wear them `` Heehee , I do n't know why I just want to buy them at that moment .
After I go home , I feel I have bought the wrong things and feel unsatisfied .
On the other hand , when my friends are annoyed with me , I will feel angry for a few days .
But , after a week , I will feel nothing at all .
So , every little thing can make me happy , and every little thing can make me depressed .
I do n't know how to answer this question .
Today I went to a restaurant with my family .
It was the last chance we had to rest this summer .
My father said , `` Let 's eat a delicious lunch ! ``
We could eat anything for a thousand yen but my father had 4 meal tickets , so we could eat for free ! : D
There was a lot of delicious food !
For example , French cuisine , Chinese food , Japanese food and dessert ! !
I heartily ate my fill but my family ate more .
My father and brother ate three times as much as I did !
It 's raining today .
so I spoke slowly .
I will study harder in English pronunciation tomorrow .
Developed countries often give financial aid to poor / developing countries , but this alone does not solve poverty . Developed countries should also give other types of help to poor countries instead of / in addition to financial aid .
Currently , it is not uncommon for rich countries offer financial aid to the poor countries , for the sake of helping them shake off ( overcome ) poverty .
But the effort seems to not be effective enough , and as a result many impoverished countries still suffer from poverty and other problems .
Therefore , in what form of aid should be offered to the poor countries has been a topic of discussion .
Some people are convinced that wealthy countries should offer aid in alternative forms such as education or technology instead of strictly financial support .
There is no doubt that one country can not develop to be a strong one while it is always relying on other countries ' help .
It is through the development of education and technology that one country can really push another country to become a wealthy one .
When a country is so poor that it can not develop its own education and technology by itself , the assistance from rich countries can make a great impact .
India is a country which used to be so poor that it could not afford the huge domestic cost , but it became more powerful than ever before due to the development of computer technology , which it benefitted from the technology aids received from developed countries .
Many poor countries rely on direct financial support to relieve pressures of poverty , which they can use in different ways to alleviate the poverty , such as buying foods to combat hunger , or buying military equipment for the stability of the country .
In some cases , the citizens of such countries will continue to suffer from hunger and hardship if financial aid is withdrawn .
The main issue should be how the poor countries make good use of these aids in order to improve the well - being of their citizens .
I just learnt a new phrase , `` to the core . `` So I would like to try and make some example sentences .

It 's really hot and humid now in Tokyo , and I could not endure this heat and humidity with my hair which was pretty long for guys .
Also I did n't go for a haircut for long time , so my hair was quite a bit longer than usual .
Well , it 'll be easier to overcome this summer heat ( or weather ) with this hair : )

Bad news
To an ordinary Chinese famer , cancer might the last illness he wants to deal with .
What he earns from hard work can only cover his daily necessities .
They never ask for anything more in their lives .
A few weeks ago , he was diagonsed with having liver cancer .
Going to Shanghai and getting an operation can save him .
This will cost at least 150000 yuan .
Where will he get the money ?
We relatives ca n't lend him a hand , since we are all poor .
Even though China is stronger than before , polarization of rich and poor is deeper .

These are some of her works .
I started working out since June so it 's been almost five months .
When I first thought of about registering at the gym , I hesitated .
Since I considered myself not so consistent , I was afraid that it might end up as a waste of money .
I wanted if that could happen to me , too .
And I gained 4kg a month later .
I guess that is because of my bad eating habits
Mostly I eat snacks and foods with high calories .
I went to eat a hamburger by bike .
That 's all . It was good !

I will go to England , and I hope that I will learn a little .
Thank you for reading or correcting it .
Fourth Day
We had a different teacher again today .
Actually in the past three days , we have had three different teachers . One for each day .
What our class did today is ; we had a discussion about marriage in the morning class and then a vocabulary quiz .
For the afternoon class , we talked about personalities and then we watched a movie .
I have to wait until Monday .
I have no afternoon class tomorrow , so I 'm going to go Downtown for some shopping and get something for Lama , my host mother 's grandchild , for his birthday .
He 's very funny , and a real good guy .
He taught me a lot of slang words & phrases so far .
He 's going to back to Phineas where he works and he will have his wedding out there !
I wish him a safe trip and a happy wedding .
I 'm reading `` A Christmas Carol , `` and I 'm wondering about whether there are any differences between the English used 100 years ago and the English used now .
I can recognize the difference between Japanese used 100 years ago and now easily .
How about in English ?
Is this any ( kind of ) allergy ?
My son is playing a game on Wii this morning .
I want my children 's English to keep improving .
My son tried a Skype English Lesson , but he did n't like it .
This is my first letter . I live in Russia and study in school .
Some days ago our English teacher told us about an exchange program in the USA for one year .
This information appears reall interesting to me because I want visit the USA to learn English !
Yesterday I found some information about this program on the internet .
And I read that all students must have had some English studies before . ( challenges )
First , applicants must pass the school 's program tests .
If a participant passes the tests , he or she must came here again after a week and write an essay for the second test .
Then , when commissions decides that the applicant did well , , you must write for more tests .
What do you think ? Can I pass the challenges ? ? ? = )

Because so many restaurants ( had ) put up `` VALENTINE ' S DINNER `` ads !
Valentine 's Day !
It was assigned by my teacher and I am going to present it next thursday .
After finishing it , I soon fell asleep .
Suddenly , I felt my bed shaking and the whole building too !
I was too frightened to jump out of my bed at that time because I had just come out of a dream .
I thought about what I should do if the next big shake comes , like what stuff to bring with me and calling my sleeping mother .
Fortunately , after a while it seemed like no more earthquakes would come , and I soon fell asleep again .
In fact the situation has been quite frequent in Taiwan , because the country is located at an active seismic belt .
It 's not the first time for me , though .
I still felt scared , especially because the terrible one in China had just happened .
It took so many people 's lives , made thousands of people homeless , and crushed China 's economy .
I really can do nothing against nature .
Maybe all we can do is accept it and be stronger .
We should not blame nature or anything else .
It 's not the revenge of the earth .
It 's not a bad omen for the 2008 Olympics , either .
It is just a natural event that humans have to get accustomed to .
I really pity the victims of that earthquake .
I hope they can get through the disaster soon .
I went to Tokyo during winter vacation .
I went to go see my father , I felt very crowded . I also wen toYushima temple . After various prayers I began to feel the important cultural heritage .
I use Auto cad .
This is a CAD using world .
Auto cad has Short cut key ( s ? ) .
Shortcut keys are very convenient .
Does anyone use Autocad ?
What is the difference between `` would n't `` and `` did n't `` in the sentence of my text ?
This time , my question is about the difference of meaning between two phrases .
The other is `` I [ did n't ] know the differnce . ``
So , you said to me `` You wore my shoes home by mistake . ``
I said to you `` I would n't have known the difference ``
And how do the two phrases change the meaning ?
Could you teach me the difference between the two phrases ?
I think you will say `` What happened `` ?
Yesterday , I sensed that my computer could n't input sounds from line - in .
( That is very bad . If nothing is done about it , I ca n't compose soundtracks . )
I thought it was a driver issue and reinstalled the sound drivers .
But , that was wrong and now I 'm trying to reinstall the OS .
I installed the driver . . .
. . but , my computer still ca n't record anything . . .
That action was wrong , too . . .
I just do n't wanna be alone .
Damn it . . .
I was snowbording .
It was fun .
But my muscles are tired because of my age .
I am older than before .
I have an ad interview .
Because I had such a great interview last night .
Today I 'm in a bad mood because it is raining .
I ca n't go outside .
It is a comic ( manga ) about basketball .
Have you heard of it ?
Meanwhile they say global warming is getting worse and that the earth is getting warmer and warmer .
Our history is less than . 000002 percent of the earth 's history .
They say human beings are damaging the earth , which I think is maybe true .
During a two nights ' stay , we skiied 2 hours in the morning and in the afternoon too .
The first time , the snow was powdery , but later it became artificial .
We enjoyed the educational school trip .
I 'd like to work in Zama camp .

But I ca n't speak English very well .
A friend of mine said that English was easy .
I understood that it was a withdrawal symptom of quitting smoking when I investigated the cause .
But , I have to keep myself from smoking !
Today I want to talk about one more of my hobbies .
I became interested in it whenI was infirst year ( I 've just finished the third year now ) .
I don ` t know whether you know about this game .
This game was created in Belarus by Mr .
The basic idea of game consists of the performance of various tasks for districts for a while .
The winner of the game is the player or the command that is the first to finish all of the levels .
Thus the quantity of tasks , sequence of their performance , time for performance of one task are not regulated by rules and are established by the authors under their discretion .
The game takes place at night .
And all night your friends and you travel about the city , solve riddles , search for codes and treasures in the most improbable places .
It can be both in the uncompleted building and in the garages .
It usually takes ( me ) some time to write down my ideas and thoughts .
Grad students are required to have some academic skills .
Reading and writing are the most important , and maybe discussion skills as well .
Anyway , I 'll try to write something on here as much / often as possible , at least keep doing it for a while .
Now I 'm thinking about what I am going to write . .
What is the different nuance ?
I had a productive day ( when ? ) and it was humid yesterday .
By the way , I have n't prepared forthe New York trip yet , first I want to buy a rather large sized suitcase .
I am anticipating a big one , one , which could make you feel so powerless when surrounded by it , and feel the beauty of nature and the impulse to cry .
All you could see would be white , white , white .
I must say I just experienced those feelings when I was , like 9 , walking in my primary school campus with my mom , with my hand in hers .
I can still remember the warmth of her hand .
Fukushima is famous for its hot springs and it is n't far away from my house .
There are many hotels , which have hot spring public baths , around the station there .
It 's an open - air bath and was really nice and we relaxed .
I wonder . Could it be from the hot springs . . . ?
I am a contract engineer .
I am always in the office for my work , but not today as I first had to go to work site with an
electrical engineer .
Our work is to build Metro .
I like my job , I think it 's interesting .
I traveled around three countries from 26th April to 4th March .
I went to Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia .
I 'm going to write an entry in my journal about my trip tomorrow .
Today I 'm writing about my greatest impression .
It was a last day on my trip
and I had I chartered a tuktuk to go sightseeing .
I went to the Land Mine Museum ,
which is a small museum .
It is privately owned by Aki Ra , who was child soldier for the Khymer Rogue .
Now he wants to remove all of the land mines in Cambodia .
A lot of land mines that were removed by Aki Ra are on display in the museum .
Many civilians were slaughtered by the Khymer Rouge .
There are so many victims ' bones and skulls in the memorial tower .
I talked with the tuktuk driver about a lot of things .
He told me about the Khymer Rouge , Pol Pot and so on .
He spoke English fluently and Japanese a little .
We spoke in a mixture of English and Japanese .
I wondered why he had n't become a tour guide .
He said `` If you want a good job , you need a lot of money in Cambodia .
Honestly , Cambodia is a corrupted society . ``
I wonder about my life .
At the same time , I also felt vain since I do n't think that I am quite as brilliant .
So , I decided I would be bright , just like that floral arrangement .
It is Thursday from steamy Japan
How is everyone going to spend their summer vacation ?
What would you want to do if you could take the entire summer off work ?

We have plans go to Seattle from July 7th for 4 days ( Actually 3 nights stay ) , so we decided go back to Japan on July 13th .
Left - Handed
I 'm left - handed ( person ) .
Many years ago , in Japan , left - handed people were rare .
There is a reason for this .
Many parents thought that lefties would lead inconvenient lives because most tools are made for right - handed persons for example .
They forced their children to use their right hands .
In fact , I had trouble cutting things with scissors , and my parents made me use my right hand .
Happily ( ? ) I have been writing and using tools with my left hand .
However , recently many teachers in Japan have pointed out that the number of left - handed children is increasing .
We had a hand - rolled sushi - party .
You can choose your own ingredients and put them and rice on layer of seaweed and roll it by yourself .
But I heard that many Europeans and Americans do n't like seaweed .
My Korean friend gave me the recipe and I made it and served it that day .
I 'm happy today
My broken leg is getting better and better so I can move around with it , which feels good .
Also , the Chinese stock maket came back from rock bottom today , so my stock is up
3 points . It 's a lucky day today , apart from the hot weather .
I ate a spicy hot pot on Sunday noon , but because of chewing not easily so I just eat duck blood and bean curd .
It is partly because I wanna pass the University I want to , and partly because I just love English .
Though , Unfortunately , I ca n't speak English anymore because of the lack of practicing speaking English , I 'll try to .
I wish to diet ! ! ! !
Do you think about diets ?

I have a lot of these parties , mabye five or six .
Therefore , in your organization , I can contribute to the improvement of expatriation programme by demonstrating what issues Japanese expatriates and their families have faced and identifying how they can be satisfied with their lives in the UK .
This experience will help me smoothly work with international colleagues and clients in your global organizational environment .
At six o ' clock , my Dad woke me up and we went walking , to get some exercise , near the park .
When we came back and stood in front of our home , the neighbor 's uncle opened his door and said hello to us .
It was very scary !
It was a disgusting thing for me because I am a severe clean freak so I ca n't endure the touch of any animal .
Many people consider it a perfect romance and that it can touch their souls .
The movie makes them satisfied about love but I do n't think so .
It is so sad and makes me unhappy .
everyone ,
But still I 'm not very good in speaking and listening .
I will try to keep my dairy here and hope you will give me comments .

The Greek debt crisis has caused massive damage throughout the Eurozone financial system and there is a strong possibility of a sharp downturn ( across the board ) .
Accordingly , there is a strong possibility of cutting the policy rate starting in November .
These last few day have been a little hard time for me .
I think the reason why I got upset is
I never thought it would become a problem for me .
Others may have this problem , but definitely not me .
At least this time I know I faced my emotions honestly .
Silver week starts tomorrow .
I have five days off .
I usually get up late on holidays , but I 'm going to get up early this time .

so that we do n't need to wait in line .
If you come to Japan , you should eat at MIDORI sushi .
My school festival 's name is ' Mok - ryeon - je ' .
Cuz my school festival is known for many interesting programs .
I am in a female high school , but I can meet male students during the school festival . ( Yippee ! )
Many bands from other male schools and B - BOY teams will come to our festival .
It is the first event in the festival .
Since this festival will be the only festival in our high school life , ( Sadly , when we 're seniors in High School , we ca n't even attend the school festival . )
many girls participate in this one .
Would you come to my school festival ?
I went to Myeong - Dong with my boyfriend yesterday .
We ate delicious foodand went window shopping .
I wanted to buy it , but I was put off by the price at first .
When we left the pub , I regretted not buying the sweater , so I returned to the store to buy it .
However , the store was already closed , so I simply had to go home .
Despite going to watch Avatar on Monday ,
Today I told my friend that `` Avatar is a great movie ! `` , so she said she wanted to go soon ! !
I did n't think that I would watch the movie twice .
but I would n't want to go a third time .
Yesterday , I attended a lecture called the `` International Contribution Leader Training Program `` .
The program started in May 2008 .
And the program ended yesterday .
I changed because of this program .
But I want to say only one thing , thank you very much ! !
About an advice .
Do you follow an advice when you asked for it ?
Most of the people I know tend not to .
I do n't judge them - everyone knows that it 's easy to give an advice to others .
Sometimes they just tell me : `` Sorry , but you do n't quite understand my situation `` or `` Thank you for your opinion , but it still seems too complicated for me , I need to think about it some more before I make any decision `` .
But sometimes it turns just ridiculous .
My friend tells me : `` I need your advice `` and at the moment I feel all important and responsible of the statement .
- I was going somewhere with somebody .
But then I let them down , and now they are against me .
I analyze and try to find the best words to explain my point of view .
I think about my friend 's and friend of her 's feelings and do my best to be unbiased .
I explain to her and when I finish I feel like my piece of advise is n't a bad one .
And I know what it means : I 'd rather just pretend that nothing happened .
Well , but I 'm glad that her problem was not that serious as she told me .
People always need some support , but they never need anyone to tell them what to do !
That is my opinion about an advice ^ _ ^
The hanabi season is September and August .
In Japan , HANABI are divided into High - into - the air fireworks and Toy fireworks .
An old HANABI Festival is `` Sumidagawa . ``
I am going to go to a Hanabi festival in August .
With whom have you been to see fireworks ?
or , Who are you going to see fireworks with this year ?
It 's about two weeks more before I will go home .
I 'm going to be with my family and my girlfriend .
I can imagine how happy I 'll be .
I will sing Karaoke , ride my bike around the town , and eat a lot of delicious things .
In the morning , I will sit on the bank of the Huong river and have some coffee .
Time , please pass quickly ! !
A little while ago , I had a nibble of an apple .
If I was asked `` what is your favorite food ? `` , I 'd answear `` apples are the best `` .
Technically , my favorite food is not exactly apples because there are many other delicious foods which satisfy my palate .
In Japan , there is one saying that / which goes , `` Apples in the morning are golden apples ``
From a nutritional point of view , they contain a lot of fibers .
It means that eating them facilitates the diffusion of solid excrements .
My favorite book is called `` The cat with a million lives ``
Please read the story below .
There once was a cat who lived for a million years .
He died a million times and he lived a million times .
He was a splendid tabby cat .
Millions of people loved the cat .
When the cat died , they all cried .
One time , the cat was taken by the King .
He hated the King .
Kings like war and are always waging war .
And then , the King put the cat into a luxurious cage for war .
First time : )
Hello ~ : ]

I like to play soft ball .
I belong to the softball team in my school .
Today , our team had a practice game .
I was a little tense , but I had four hits in two games .
Last night , I tried to organize programs I do not use .
The maintenance will take longer than originally thought .
We are going to shutdown the server for 2 hours to maintenance the server .
The down time is as follows :
Thank you very much ,
I ca n't help feeling absurd . . .
I heard Phonics are popular for native children learning English pronunciation .
I want to speak English as well as a native .
When I watch a foreign movie , I often hear the word [ you know ? ] .
There are various situations it 's used in , so I am at a loss .
But I want to use a new phrase , so please teach me how to use this phrase .
My hobby is taking pictures and using photoshop to retouch them .
I can make a picture blue or brighter with photoshop .
Hello !
Hello .
I 'm not good at English , so I am writing an entry on `` Lang - 8 `` .
I will try to write sentences in English .
What the Hell ?
How could such good web sites be banned ?
They have no right to determine which sites we access .
Without these treasured sources , I can hardly enjoy any videos about magic .
I can not believe it .
I can only use proxies to get on these web sites .
It 's terrible !
These days I often read Japanese literature because they are in my new electoronic dictionary .
I like to read books written by Dazai Osamu .
I could n't study English and I did n't write English sentences .
I felt that it was necessary for me to continue studying English .
I had good time , it was a nice wedding .
I stayed overnight and I went to Nagoya castle which is famous in Nagoya .
It is especially famous for the gold shachihoko on the Nagoya castle .
We ate ice - cream that tasted like miso . It was hot that day .
It was an interesting taste .
I looked beautiful around Nagoya station .
The electric wires were buried underground .
I was very tired but I had a good time .
We slept in the Shinkansen ( superexpress ) .
I want the same dress as in this picture .
I played the game of Shogi , that Japanese traditional game .
Shogi is similar to chess .
The number of players is two , and they play alternatively ( in turn ) .
has been got from the enemy .
the number of playing patterns might be infinity .
Yesterday I caught this phrase in Obama 's speech made at the G20 in Central London .
For me , participal constructions sound very OR quite formal , hitherto I 've only seen them in written English or heard them in someone 's speech . .
OR or does it sound inappropriate for everyday use ?
pity that I do n't have a mate to share the / those beautiful scenes with .
What crazy weather !
The weather cast said , it will snow again in March .
global warming is becoming very serious .
Pohang does n't usually snow as much as it did this year .
It 's hard to keep a garden clean particularly in summer ,
when plants grow thick .
If you do n't remove the weeds from your garden for one week during summer , it 'll soon appear like a jungle .
And then , watering them also become a problem because of the shortage of water .
In addition , we also have to get rid of worms .
We all rose our goblets happily except one classmate .
I asked the waitress if there was any grape fruit juice .
There is a desk , a bed and so on .
I think my room is a little messy , so I need to clean it ( . ) .
What do you do in your room ?
I do many things in my room like studying , surfing the Internet , sleeping , reading books and so on .
I like this room the better than the other rooms in my house .
He himself of the need to study .
All sorts of people gathered in the club .
For example there were : American , Chinese , Korean , Arabian , Hispanic and Japanese .
The range of age was wide , betwwen 20 and 60 .
I went to Karaoke with the member ( A colleague ? ) .
But I could not choose the song everybody would know and come alive to .
Go to dentist
Today , Jason had an appointment with the dentist .
Last time when we had come to clinic , he never stopped crying , so we had had to go back home without treatment .
After sniffing up the opiate , he became like drunkard .
He just looked sort of drained , and then , he continued to smile and kiss me , and spoke mixed words .
I should have recorded his weird behavior : D
Today I joined Lang - 8 .
So , I think that I want to be able to speak English better !
After that , I joined here .
I will introduce myself .
Anyone who likes japan animation , leave me a message or comment , please !
My first name consists of 2 Chinese characters . .
My parents gave me this name because they want me to grow up kind and have a hope forever .
I went to my college for the first time today .
I felt the stress .
But , I made friends with other students .
I 'm now learning accounting in English beause of business .
I must memorize many words of accounting , such as
I bought the textbooks that are for accounting subjects from an American university .
I graduated from a Japanese university .
I must study as a freshman .
It is very refreshing for me to study as a student , and I am reminded of my youth : )
Same as former British Prime Minsiter Margaret Thatcher ( spelling ? ) , so I 'm also an iron lady ! !
So many people are learning English and looking for a teacher to correct their language , but there are not so many native English speakers here . . .
It 's fun for me to correct sentences for Japanese learners . Perhaps I could concentrate on correcting their Japanese for a while and wait for more English speakers to join Lang - 8 ! ?
try using Lang - 8
I 'm working as a systems engineer at a Japanese IT company in Tokyo .
So now I 'm struggling to catch up with this great transition .

My favorite artists are AAA , KARA , Girls generation , Avril Ramona Lavigne , , , , .

My favourite writers are Dan Broun and Jane Austen .
Dan Brown is the author of the bestsellers `` The Da Vinci Code `` and `` Angels & Demons `` .
Also I like `` Pride and Prejudice `` by Jane Austen .
When I was a student , I suffered from acne .
I 've never used an American - made acne product so it was difficult to heal from acne .
Japanese acne products do n't include benzoyl peroxide .
When I used an American - made acne product , that included benzoyl peroxide , my acne healed up .
Lately , my few friends have said to me that they want to use American - made acne products .
I used proactiv but it is a little expesive than others .
Could you recommend some acne products to me ?

I hope I will make it to my 200th entry within the next year .
Why did I choose to work as an au pair ?
On the 15th of July last year I came to London with the idea of working as a waitress , cleaner or something like that , so I rented a room in a shared house in an eastern suburb of London and started to look for a job .
One week later , I still did n't have sheets in my bed cause my landlady had n't brought them yet .
for 4 people .
And , on top of that , the shower head only worked if you put it at no more than 10 centimetres from the bottom of the bath .
But at the very least I like to have a shower standing up !
So , I checked all the possibilities : au pair , hotel waiting staff , trying another shared house , . . .
I thought about the pros and cons of every type of job and finally decided to make an au pair profile in a specialty website and look for a family .
And that 's the reason for why I ended up working as an au pair .
( The next chapter will be about how I looked for a family )
I 'm bored , so I 'll write something here ^ ^ .
Currently , I have to stay at home because I 'm ill ; _ _ ; I have the chickenpox !
Next month I should be moving out from my little city < finally ! > .
The big city is waiting .
And make new friends , yeah !
Do you know Giada De Laurentiis , who is a cooking adviser ?
She is not well known in Japan .
I like cooking , especially Italian food .
When I went to Hawaii I watched a TV show called `` Food network `` .
Those dishes seemed delicious .
Today I listened to a song called Tsunami .
Tsunami is sung by the Japanese rock band Southern All Stars .
I watched a video on youtube about it .
Tsunami is a disaster like an earthquake .
Japan was recently by a big one .
Well , some wonder why they 've named the song `` Tsunami . ``
Is n't there a better alternative ?
It makes me happy even in this situation .
But know , it 's only possible mor me to go for a senior college degree in SP .
I have no idea what architecture courses are in senior colleges in Singapore .
I love to watch Japanese dramas
Recently , I 've watched Strawberry on The Short Cake , Romeo and Juliet
I hope who had come across my journal could post me a link to watch
By the way , last night I had come across Torrents and
If I 'm not mistaken , we could download movies that way
People with information about them please message me
I went swimming this morning .
I have decided to do sports once or twice a week .
Keeping this promise is building my confidence .
September starts from today .
In America , September is the first month of the fiscal ( school ) year , is n't it ?
( In Japan , April is the first month not September ) .
My objective for September is to be able to speak and write English more .
I want to live in America after graduating from school : )
I talked about what I have learned about English on the Internet .
I heard that there are 3 websites for studying English .
fm so that I could memorize a lot of English words for the TOEIC .
In the meantime , I wanted to talk in English using the words that I had retained from smart .
Now I write a daily journal everyday in English .
I 'm reading the original .
The transfer is scheduled from December 28th to 29th and we will launch the new office on February 1st .
Tonight the Internet 's speed is very slow , so I found some downloadable videos to watch .
And I just found that The big bang thoery is so funny , no matter how many times I have watched , I always laughed .
But the newest episode will come on April 1st , it is too long to wait to watch it . It 's really terrible .
It is bad for the stomach . If you want to lose weight , you should keep exercising .
It has low calories and high protein .
So some athletes who build up their muscles and body often eat it .
How to make Sasami fry :
cut chicken into bite sizes

I think I need to learn English . . .
the word in ( a ) . . .
actually it 's `` something `` in the blank , but grammatically it is better to be `` anything `` , which we Japanese are always careful about .
Recently , I 'm working very hard at part time jobs to earn money .
For example , I worked at the bread shop from 6 : 00am to 4 : 00pm except between 10 : 30am to 11 : 30am as that is my break . After that , I worked at the chinese restaurant from 6 : 30pm to 10 : 00pm .
Today , I worked at bread shop from 6 : 00am to 14 : 00 except for my 1 hour break , and from 5 : 30pm , I 'm going to go to the chinese restaurant to work .
One of the stereotype of Japanese is `` hard working `` , and I think I 'm just the stereotypical Japanese now . : - (
In Mar 26 , I was planing to go to Pensacola to see my older sister , But this trip was my the worst and unforgot trip .
First I need to go to Seattle - Tacoma International Airport and go to Houston to transfer the airplane , and the touble was coming : When the first flight was ready to fly , the attendant has told us that this plane was detected a `` unpredict `` problem on this plane and then they started to explain the question which the passanger asked .
About 2 hours after , they said that the Contiental Airline could help us that change the another airplane so that we can go on trip right away .
Then I have to back to the Terminal and went to the another boarding gate in order to I can go to Pensacola as quickly as possible .
Sharn 's first trouble ended .
In 8 : 30 I arrived in the Houston international Airport , when I prepared to go to another borading gate , the flight number and destination was changed , I ask the fornt desk of Contiental Airline and they told me that this flight was cancelled because the bad weather on the north part of the America and So I have to stay in a hotel on one night in Huston .
However , when I took a phone call to the hotel to ask the room , the staff told me that there was no more space in this hotel , So I have to go to Contiental Airline service center to told them to change the hotel because this hotel was full , then they help me to contacted another hotel which has a room for rent to me .
Finally I arrived the hotel to took a nap and prepare the flight next day .
At 5 : 30 on mar 27 , I caught the Shuttle Bus between the hotel and the airport . At 7 : 20 I boarded the plane that was destined for Pensacola and 2 hours later I arrived safely .
In conclusion , this is my first time to travel abroad on U .
My daughter 's front upper tooth has become loose these days .
While we were waiting for the tooth coming out , I found some of the tooth had turned violet during dinner yesterday .
The middle of the back had turned red .
I was worried about it and called the dentist this morning .
The dentist told me that it 's no problem , even if a loose baby tooth turns violet or red , but he 's not sure if it 's fine unless he looks at it .
Then I made an appointment for her .
It 's quarter to six today .
Yesterday , I ran a marathon , 42 . 195km .
It was too hot to run a long distance , or even to do any other exercise outdoors .
I poured water over my head several times , too .
I ran in the shade as much as possible to minimize the exposure to direct sunlight .
It was very tough , but I did it .
I 'm looking forward to seeing it .
Today , I drew a picture for my friend 's band .
The picture , a man standing by the sea as the sun shines down on him , will be printed on T - shirts .
I only know the band from the web .
I 've never meet them in person .
But , next month I 'm going to see them for the first time .
I hope they will like these T - shirts .
I started to walk everyday .
I want run instead , but it 's too hard for me .
This park is pretty big , with many flower gardens in it .
Now , the rape blossoms and a certain kind of cherry blossoms are at their
But my foot and back hurt .
Oh my god , tomorrow is Monday again and we have to hand in our weekend homework , but there are so much homework to do .
I hate repeatedly rewriting the English sentences that I wrote incorrectly .
It does n't have any effect on my English learning !
What I need to do is just correct it once and remember them so that I wo n't make the same mistakes again .
Oh I really do n't know what the teachers are thinking .
Maybe you mean ' Wish me luck . . . '
I attended a Christmas party at church last Saturday that was held for working people .
They had many simple games .
There were 4 people and 3 chairs .
One of the girls , who is my friend , pulled out the chair another girl was trying to sit on and she fell on her backside !
It was unbelievable for me because I 've done the same thing when I was a child and my teacher scolded me so much .
Some people say it 's an international school , and it might be . . , but in fact it 's a lot more than that .
It 's a non - profit organization that brings students from around the globe together . Students are selected based on merit through a total or partial scholarship program , so the ability to pay is n't taken into account at all .
I want one of those scholarships so bad , it 's my dream to get to know more of the world , to get to know a lot of cultures , and to be able to speak foreign languages fluently .
And being able to learn all of that from people with such different backgrounds is what makes UWC so special to me , it 's the perfect place for everything that I want to do .
I just ca n't imagine the way it would impact my life , such a wonderful experience .
My brother has often made me sad since he finished his army service .
He began to smoke and play games day and night in a cybercafe .
Because this , my little sister and I had to often go and find him in the cybercafe .
His phone was always off and he did 't go to home to sleep at night .
I remebered waiting for him , resulting in me weeping all night .
My parents hoped that he would go to China together with them and that maybe thay can change his temper and bad habits .
But he insists on staying in Taiwan and on keeping his bad behavior , making us feel pain and helpless .
Today my father on a rare visit , came to Taiwan . I was very happy .
And then my brother said that he had a test . ( I do n't trust him , he had to be going to cybercafe . )
So we waited for him until 6 o ' clock , and when he did n't still come home and my father lost his temper .
( If it 's 10 : 00 o ' clock and he still has n't come home , we decide to lock the door . )
At 8 : 00 , when my brother came home , we were preparing to shout at him .
Suddently he said , `` I have decided to go to China with father , because I ca n't hold onto myself `` .
We were so surprised and began to smile .
It 's so surprising that I ca n't believe it !
I always really worry about him .
Althought I do n't know him going to China is a good thing , that he want to change himself makes me feel happy .
It 's one of Japan 's Holidays today .
By the way , I like mountains much more .
( as holidays of course ) .
Do you know that Japan ( being describled as a workaholic country ) has 15 holidays , the most out of all developed countries ?
Of course , I did n't know .
I ( have ) a little free time , so I ( have restarted ) using Lang - 8 ! !
A lot of things have happened this month .
I ca n't describe ( everything ) , ( comma ) but our family is very good now .
Our ( relatives ) do n't live in the Tohoku area , ( comma ) but my husband 's friend 's house was ( destroyed ) by big tsunamis .
We are always ( worrying ) about his family .
I had a slight fever .
Work will likely be hard / tough tomorrow .
It was very hot there , and I got sunburn on my left arm .
Athens is full of people and dilapidated ancient monuments .
The trip to Athens did n't relax me .
Result of 17th September work
Today , I thought [ about something ] very deeply .
What should an artist be like , what should a bussinesman be like .
When I make a mistake , there is a brand impact .
I received a letter from a young girl from the U .
I am interested in you , I will like if you email me back at my ( favourbarkani @ yahoo .
uk ) because I will like to scan my photo so you will understand me well .
Hawaii Vol . 2
Today , I will write about my trip again .
There was a vivid magenta Bougainvillea near the Kailua beach park .
I ordered a delicious fruit salad .
This beach is very famous for the sea turtles that come to sunbathe there .
At that time , there were no sea turtles on the beach , instead there was a Hawaiian monk seal .
He was big and was just sleeping on the beach .
I think that all bus systems in the world hastheir advantages and disadvantages .
I have lots of homework .
So I 'm going to go to the library to do it . . . . .
Instead of not doing it , I got great memories ! !
Today , I went to a dentist .
because I had a toothache last night -
it is very painful , I do n't want to go to the dentist .
but I have to go tomorrow again for my teethridge .
I do n't know why I have a cavity dakneunde , I brush my teeth daily .
The baby has arrived !
The year 2011 has started with the arrival of a new baby in my family .
His older brother , Pax , likes to take care of him .
It 's lovely to see the older trying to hold the little one and to hear what he says to the baby .
People say that the older one often gets jealous of the newcomer and acts nasty , or behaves like a baby .
But I can see now that Pax sometimes pretends to be a small baby - he sometimes wants to feed / nurse from my breast and he crawls .
I look forward to seeing how they their relationship as brothers develops .
I hope they can be the best of friends with each other .
I 'm starting to learn English
I 'm a university student .
( looks like a fencing ) I started it as an elementary student .
So I 've been playing Kendo for a long time .
Last year I went to Toulouse , France for one month .
That was a very good place ! !
It was very funny , because the first time I tried to speak French I could n't communicate with people well .
So after few days , I started always using English .
I 'm interested in the cultures of various countries .
I want to talk with people from different countries .
The Project Manager should have a set of skills or techniques , including the abilities to raise the sharp questions , detect the unknown assumptions , and solve the conflicts between people , etc .
Also including many skills in modern management as well .
The major responsibility of the Project Manager is to identify different risks that affect the success of the Project , which should be measured by formal or informal ways throughout the whole project .
Risk always generates from the uncertainty of the project .
A successful project manager often takes the risk of paying to much attention to the matter .
I agree with such a opinion as a qualified project manager comes not only from studying , but more from practicing . .
I will go on a school trip to Hokkaido from September 15th to the 18th .
I have never been to Hokkaido so I 'm looking forward to going .
In fact , I hardly know anything about them .
So I ca n't do n't teach you anything .
But I will tell you about it when I return from my school trip .
I first read the Japanese version when I was 6 or 7 years old .
This is the second book in the series `` My Father 's Dragon `` as you know .
The English is easy but it makes me clearly imagine each scene .
The rhythm of the sentences make it easy to read .
This story begins with a scene in which a dragon was saved and flew away from an island where ferocious animals had locked him up .
9 - year old Elmer saved the dragon .
Then they were on their way home .
First they came across Tangerina Island with many tangerines .
After suffering a storm , they flew down to a little green island .
There they met some canaries whose king was sick from curiosity .
This is the end of the first part .
I will write about the final part tomorrow .
Because , I ( study ) with my friend K , about optimistic training for special education ( educated ) children .
I wanted to study this long time ago .
So , I felt ( feel ) that today is a day which my dreams comes true !
So , I felt satisfied
it turned sunny
Tomorrow Im gon na take the SSAT .
wish me luck luck & plz cross ur fingers ( everyone on Lang - 8 ) for me !
Currently , I often watch English movies in order to practice English .
My favorite movies are as follows :
- Back to the Future
- Kiki 's Delivery Service
- The Holiday
I like SF , romance , and action ( movies ) .
The movies I like have a gentle , fine feel .
Or also please let me know a wonderful movie in difficult English .
Every time he came to our house before , he brought us something nice and exotic from China - however , he had ran out of souvenirs that he had brought from home that particular night .
So he handed to each of my daughters a plastic cage in which a little creature was making rattling noises on the pebbles .
I loved animals but I had never fancied reptiles that much .
So as to be polite , I suprisingly told our guest a white lie - commenting that the turtles he brought were absolutely aadorable .
Years passed , and they grew as time flew by .
I once brought them to a vet when they got sick . They suffered symptoms like having no appetite and swollen eyes . The treatment was two shots and it cost me 200 dollars .
Now , I love them so much !
It 's so funny in an ironical way that love seems to appear out of nowhere .
It 's pure emotion towards these turtles .
My daughter has named the turtles Mai - chan and Chibi - chan , but I 'm actually secretly calling them Julia and Robert .
I 'm very excited for finding this site .
I 'm learning English and want to improve it .
I did n't know there was a useful website like this .
programming is very difficult
today , I start to study programming .
but I did n't understand php ( ? ) .
it is very difficult .
I 'm writing a diary entry in English for the first time .
It 's travel to a foreign country with my father .
When I was a child , I promised my father that I would become able to speak English and to take him to a foreign country .
So , I will study English and take him to a foreign country .
On monday morning if you have breakfast in an Italian bar you 'll hear comments about the results of Sunday 's football matches .
In the Italian championship there are 20 teams ( in Premier League ) ; the teams with the best players are : Juventus , Inter , Milan and Rome .
Every Sunday the teams begin playing at 3 o ' clock p . m . , the match lasts 90 minutes .
Soon after the games end , sports programs air on tv till 7 p .
There are link - ups with sports journalist in each stadium , interviews with the coaches or players and images of several goals , corner kicks , free kicks , penalty kicks , expulsions , warnings and failed goals .
After prime time , other sports programs start again for those who did n't stay at home in the afternoon watching the television .
On Monday morning after `` a day `` television commentaries there are also those of the fans !
Why did I pick that ?
Actually I do not remember why I chose the phrase .
I would be able to call myself a `` nomad . ``
Because I have been unable to stay in one place for more than 3 months .
Because of that experience , I could do jobs with various skills .
I do not know how long my schedule to stay here is .
Although many people living in this accommodation are getting worried
I can experience diverse lifestyles with this time in Australia .
At least , I will exactly predict that I think I 'll get good experience in Australia
if I return to South Korea .
Did you hear the news that an American guy won a $ 232 million jackpot ?
I ca n't even imagine such an amount !
He 's a really lucky guy !
I wish I were him .
But I worry a little that this much money will drive him crazy or ruin his life .
The mass media reports on him excessively .
I know this is just to get viewers ' attention , me included .
I think they should reflect on their sensation - seeking nature .
I hope the people surrounding him leave him alone a little .
when I draw a deep breath I feel better .
but I feel lonley .
I broke up with my boyfriend few weeks ago .
I ca n't even see him because he lives in another country .
and also , I broke off relationship with a friend .
she was my best friend .
but she made me feel bad , I do n't wanna get in touch with her anymore .
It 's really a hard time for me .
however I feel relief .
I 'm trying to get a job .
I 'm gon na make money and then I 'll go to travel alone .
china , tibet , nepal , India , and Thailand !
I failed to get a job few times , but It 's Ok .
I keep trying .
I hope I make new good friends ! !
I have a toothache today .
I 'm wondering whether I should go to a dental clinic or not .
This is my favorite subject , and it is so interesting !
The picture you can see in my profile the package of a jigsaw puzzle .
I thought I could finish it in a week or so ,
but it 's very very difficult ! ! ! ! ! !
Most of the pieces are red , so all the pieces look alike .
For your information , I have n't finished it yet .
My hobbies are skiing and judo .
I have skied since I became a junior high school student .
But the cost is incredible high ! !
On the other hand , judo is a reasonable sport .
I have a black belt .
But recently , the day does n't exist for me because I stay awake all night long and then slept until the moon
is shining right above my head .
it is kind of weird that no matter how hard I try , it 's getting worse and
It 's already eight in the morning and no need to say , I my eyes are still open even
though it is breakfast time !
I will creep into my bed in a few minute .
Why did I choose today education as a subject ?
Maybe because as a father whose child is finishing kindergarten I 'm concerned about what my daugther is going to be taught in the following years .
And because I realize , now that it has become my problem , that nowadays education in schools needs to face several challenges to be useful for children and for society .
Of course I 'm not an expert , and without doubt I 'll be inaccurate and subjetive , but I 'm going to talk about how I percieve the situation .
First of all I think we must face the fact that the problems are not going to be solved by changing the curriculum if we do n't help teachers to adapt themselves to it .
We 're going to take a tent , a sleeping bag , and so on with us so that we can sleep in the tent on the mountain .
It 's my first time staying in a tent on a mountain , so it sounds really exciting .
It has an obelisk at its peak .
I hope that I can carry all that heavy stuff and still enjoy climbing .
I love traveling and I had never traveled by myself before . I felt it was time 4 me to slip away to get some fresh air outside in April .
I surely know that it is irresponsible to disappear without saying goodbye to dad & mom .
what 's more , I definitely knew that I would hurt them , scare them and make them worry about me .
but , at that moment , I just wanted to take my ticket , searching some places to calm down and release stress .
Lijiang , a place where I could temporarily forget the pressure , slow down the pace and enjoy myself lounging around and taking pics freely and comfortably .
the old town really gave me a shot 2 purify and broaden my mind .
I made friends with strangers and now I still keep in touch with them .
sometimes I 'd luv 2 review them , reminding me of those faces , the smell of sunshine and my footprints during the trip .
I 've been learning English in school for three years .
Three years ago I was learning German , which I studied for six years !
And I was the best in the class , but now I 've forgotten everything . I wanna learn Finnish too , but it 's very difficult .
I 'm interested in other cultures , especially Japan ( and others Asian countries too ) , so if you 're Japanese , Singaporean , Korean , or other Asian , just write to me .
And I go to the Badinh square to see the national flag rise .
But many people go there earlier to exercise .
After the dysacousia whistle , the national anthem is sung strongly
Everybody has a decent and dignified stand and remain silent through the song .
when the flag is on the top of the flag tower is the right time to finish the anthem .
I 'm really excited right now ! ! !
Actually my boyfriend can correct my essays but I do n't want to ask him . . . because it 's a little bit embarrassing .
So I 'm using this site to improve my English skills .
I think I 'll write a blog entry from time to time .
And I 'm going to post a TOEFL writing essay as well : )
I am embarrased to say that I am not good at English but love to learn it .
Besides that if you want to learn Japanese , I would happy to help you ,
Well , let me cut my redundant introduction here and make some comments on latest news which drew my attention .
According to Japanese TV news , some 46000 people return to Japan after spending their golden week holiday in a foreign country .
Due to threat of swine flu , many people including nurses and airport staff check travelers .
I saw one of those travelers returning from mexico complained of the hassle at the airport .
but he should n't have gone if he did n't want to complain .
Remember that goverment warned against all non - essential travel in advance and there are some people working on this case now instead of spending vacation .
Changing My Mind
We finally decided on when we 're going to move .
We will move to another place on three consecutiveholidays : the 21st , 22nd & nbsp ; and 23rd of November .
Therefore , I must pack all thestuff in my house alone in twenty days .
It sounds really tough and hard & nbsp ; for me . . . . . .
I guess that my daughter will sometimes will help me but I do n't expect it .
In addition , if someone helps me , I will get confused about the contents of theboxes which I do n't pack by myself .
Therefore , I want to pack them alone .
I 'm sure that I must pack over 200 boxes .
Oh my gosh ! ! ! !
As we prepare to move , I will throw away all unnecessary things .
I know that there are a bunch of boxes which I have n't opened yet which I will after I moved here .
While I 've lived here , I bought a lot of things .
I regret the money I wasted to buy unnecessary things .
Are you a person who can throw away unnecessary things ?
In my case I 'm stingy and I ca n't boldlythrow things & nbsp ; away .
And I 've kept a lot of cardboard boxes which have not been opened yet
I will throw away all those boxes this time .
I want to change my mind and be a better house manager .
My home is very old . It was constructed more than thirty five years ago .
However , I like my home because it is very attractive !
One of the reasons is because of how kind the residents are .
Sometimes they scold him , but it is always tenderly because of his innocence .
So I feel that many residents watch out for my son , and I 'm really thankful .
However I have to move in a few weeks !
The new home is not so far from here and it has a more modern decor .
However , I have a confidence that I will miss my present sweet old home in the nearly future .
I moved into Burwood , located in the western suburb of Sydney .
There are many Chinese in the city .
I have been to some other suburbs such as Silverwater , and Strathfield . I do have not have any information about them .
However , it was more peaceful .
I entered here as short - term stay . It is similar to being a backpacker , so I had to buy my own food .
Luckily , it was near to Woolworth from my accommodation , so it was easy to buy food .
As a result , I became acity person .
When I lived in South Korea , I lived in the countryside .
It would take long time to adapt myself to this new life .
I feel good now because the atmosphere is silent
I drank too much and now I have a headache .
But I had such a great night because I enjoyed eating Italian food and drinking .
I expected to be hammered .
I 've never had a headache while drinking .
I 'm kind of shocked because I believe myself to be a poor drinker .
I 'm absolutely indiscriminate when it comes to music and I can listen to everything from pop to classical music .
I just laughand tease her that she is like a man .
I went with her , but just to hang out in Moscow ( I only like Metallica with the symphony orchestra and some ballads as well ) .
This spring she is going to go to Helsinki , Finland to see Iron Maiden and she ca n't wait !
My first diary entry in English
My occupation is a designer who makes a promotional movie in a certain game company .
I like reading ( foreign novels in particular ) , collecting figurines and surfing the internet .
I 'll write about those things in the diary .
First time coming here
There was a typhoon last night .
But today , is very funny .
I could see Mt .
It has a lot of snow , and it look very beautiful .
I mean I decided to use the paid study hall that my younger brother goes to .
At first , I could n't access the internet . by wireless LAN at the study hall .
But I have been able to access it the internet since I had complained to a janitor . of the study hall about that .
Here it is quiet and comfortable for studying and working .
I can put aside every temptations and break away from the crowd whenever I am here .
I am now able to understand that why my brother goes there everyday .
By the way , I think the janitor of the study hall have has nothing to do all the time .
I envy him , I want to run a study hall one day .
Which one is correct ?
which sentence is correct ?
I woke up early in the morning today .
A cool wind / breeze was blowing through the window .
Has autumn come ?
I was born in autumn , so I like this season .
It exists for autumn .
When I asked a question about the origin of the idiom `` cold turkey `` ,
So he googled it , and then answered the question .
If more English teachers had their classes online ,
it would become easier for English learners to take them .
I think it is a simple idea ,
My plan is : When I post a new entry on my blog in Chinese .
Then I will also post a new entry on Lang - 8 in English ,
Both of them will have the same content .
Last Friday , there was an Athletic Festival at my oldest daughter 's elementary school .
She enjoyed it and showed me an excellent scene in her foot - race .
She was always in the last position out of the three members .
Both boys and girls in groups of three participated in the relay race .
She said that she was always last .
Her mother told her never to give up !
In this race , she did n't get first place , but she still felt that she had won .
She gave us her best smile at the end of the day .
On Saturday , I went to a workshop about herbs .
Actually a close friend is Yoga teacher .
She is interested in all aspects of healthy living , including macrobiotic food .
, herbs , Ayurveda and so on .
Influenced by her , I have become interested in my own body and mind too .
The workshop 's teacher came to my friend 's studio from the next prefecture !
She came to here by car , bringing lots of herbs and some tools .
She is like a sunflower and has a very natural attitude and positive power .
I liked her immediately .
Today is over , I will tell you about the details of the workshop in my next journal .
Yesterday I played football ( soccer ) with my friends .
We played from 10 : 00am to 12 : 00pm .
But it was an awfully hot day in Okayama Japan yesterday .
One of my friends felt uncomfortable , and he vomited .
We baked in the blazing sun .
My skin is still burning .
Every time when I see Jim Parsons or even hear his name , I ca n't help but burst into laughter .
He is a very popular comedian and plays the role of Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory .
I like watching his show for two reasons .
The first reason is seeing his funny facial expressions , his movements , it is a really relaxing .
Whatever the mood you are in he can make you laugh .
Just like uncle McDonald who is just trying to make you happy .
The second is that all his lines are well written , not just something you forget after the show .
He puts his deep thoughts into a humorous way of expression , so you can always find something new and refreshing , you remember his magic smile on the TV .
This is why Jim Parsons always makes me laugh .
I just came back home now , I 'm tired today . . .
I had an English class early in the morning , and then I had a part time job as a Teaching Assistant .
It was a sunny morning but suddenly it began to rain when I was TA ( it 's an outdoor class ) , we got wet because of the rain . . .
After that , I did my research for my master 's thesis until . . . . . .
That 's all the things I did today . . .
Trip to see the cherry blossoms .
We made a gipbap for a lunch picnic .
Anyway , since morning , the weather was already very dark and chilly .
Then , we wondered whether buds will come into flower .
Unfortunately , it did not .
To see full blooms of cherry blossoms in Seoul , we may have to wait until this weekend .
Finally , I know that the level of my English skills are the worst .
But I 'm happy because I got to know Lang - 8 and so many teachers ( = my new friends )
I will think of English as fun and not studying . .
Sometimes I 'm so busy with work ,
but I will try to keep practicing .
Thank you for all of your help again . .
I noticed a rule that she seems to have about hugging ; when I 'm hugging her baby sister , Haru - chan , she never asks me to hug .
Lang - 8 is very busy today .
They tried to find the inspiration for their work from their familiar surroundings .
For example , Cluade Monet was the painter most attracted by the change of light and colour .
He drew the same scenes in differing lighting .
But Renoir and Degas had a slightly different preference when choosing subjects .
They enjoyed painting the people of the world .
He especially drew his friends and families a lot .
my ( or the ) Last entrance exam was not so cool
I took an English exam last Sunday .
Last time I took the exam was about one and a half years ago .
By taking same exam again , I found out that my English reading skills have gone down . . .
It seems I lost the sense of reading English .
I had the chance to speak English with my friends .
But I never actually read any books or wrote sentences in English .
So it is understandable why my English went down . . .
In order to take back my English skills ,
I 'm going to read the book called `` Eat pray love `` in English
Thanks for your help : )
I like to go see movies .
I watched a movie at a movie theater in Roppongi Hills .
go watch a movie this year
I tend to too concentrate on listening to English
I did n't know my English was improving after watching a movie , but I hope I will be able listen to more of their English if I go see a movie .
The 2010 World Cup will be held in South Africa .
and there are only two months left .
My favorite sport is soccer and I 'm always excited about the World Cup .
The 2002 Korea & Japan World Cupwas a historical event for Korea .

So I will support Korea even if I do n't get any sleep .
English School
I went to the English school in Shibuya .
It 's been two months since I started to go there .
The wether has been cold recently .
She has been teaching English for10 years
I wish I could speak English very well .
I am used to going to a grocery store to buy food and drinks .
I found a red package of chocolate there .
I 'm learning English .
Did you ever think how much you could save if you have unique knowledge about the airlines which other people do not have ?
Quite by chance , I came across on the Internet ( on humans ) , an airline employee who knows how to simply pay less . . .
It was a great surprise to me that such knowledge existed !
I decided to check it out and bought his guides .
I must tell you that I 'm still in shock . Airlines are giving great discounts to the ordinary passengers , but not to me !
This guide is a real cost saver and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money on their flights .
Anyways , I 'm here again !
It 's a place that welcomes people from around the world , and of couse , local people as well .
People who travel in Taiwan can enjoy their holidays , and enjoy some good time with local people , sharing their traveling experience or cultural differences .
It 's a shame to become a victim , especially when people do n't deem that you are hurt . . .
We ca n't blame them because if they betray our trust even we are hurt .
for those parts that have been taken ?
Hi . Good morning everyone !
Please send me a message on skype !

The most important things is that it can take pictures clearly .
I had a meeting at school today .
There was a small beautiful church next to the school .
This paper will be the last , unless it is returned to be rewritten or if I have some misunderstanding about the credits I need .
I hope these things wo n't happen .
After the cold rainy morning , it is clear and warm now .
We either have a winter day or an early summer day , but not a spring day .
It 's nice to meet you .

Please pay attention to Eugene Park 's unbelievably miserable situation .
Once , he was one of the most promising violinists in the world .
But now , he has lost his spirit and remarkable talent .
He even looks like a junkie .
There is only one violin machine who can not play the violin passionately or happily anymore .
Three of the major Korean newpapers and some portal sites are trying to cover it up .
Many witnesses have already testified about his weird behavior .
He does n't have to be treated like that .
So , please help free him .
Just a little attention could save him !
Nowadays , I enjoyplaying a car racing video game ( GT5 / PS3 ) .
I like AMG high speed driving lessons the most .
At first , I could n't drive with my heart .
To put it in other words , `` Do n't break the flow `` .

We would like to express our appreciation for your cooperation for promoting activities of Fusen ( balloon ) Volleyball this time .
Additionally , we would like to ask you to please support us in the future .
We would like to present you these things below for your cooperation in promoting Fusen ( balloon ) Volleyball activities .
We received the above things .
Every summer , a Friench student stays in Shiki , where I live .
Last year my family was a host family for a student that stayed for two weeks .
We had really good time with him , so I wanted to invite him back this year , but my mother said no because she knew she would be busy this summer .
I was sorry that we would n't be hosting a student , so I wanted to help in some way and I asked if I could help .
I expected some work , but she said the number of students was smaller than usual this year , so they did n't need help .
That was a disappointment for me because I had been eager to meet and talk with the new students .
I was by myself because no other guests were in the restaurant .
After I edited my first
diary , I was glad to get help from friends who come from other countries .
There were deaths , which is sad .
Recently earthquakes have caused damages worldwide .
It all makes me think that the end of our age is / may be near .
The most devastating earthquake was in 1985 ( 8 . 1 Richter ) , with about 10000 casualties .
The Government hid information because they did n't want people to realize the magnitude of the event .
The Government also did it because they were to blame for most of the deaths caused by the bad planning of buildings .
This year , I have witnessed three or four tremors - I ca n't rememeber how many , my head is full .
They were of high magnitude , between 5 . 5 and 7 in the Richter Scale .
I am worried that there will probably be a big earthquake in Mexico which will destroy the city ( Mexico City ) .
The city is built over a lake system , so the buildings wo n't be able to withstand the pressure .
Up until what age do people restart their lives ?
I saw a question on a Japanese website .
`` Up until what age do people restart their lives ? ``
For instance , if you realized your occupation was not suitable for you , what would you do ?
If you are young , it 's probably not so difficult to go back to school and try to become whatever you want .
I found many answers that reckoned it was around the age 30 .
I was so sad to see this answer .
30 is still kind of young .
I guess it may vary depending on the country the respondent lived in .
What do you think , can an old man restart their life filled with hope ?
If so , what age is the limit ?
Since I already have a driver 's license in Japan , I felt applying for driver 's license here should n't be so difficult .
Even so , regardless of driver 's license status overseas , everyone needs to take a paper test and a behind - the - wheel test again , so I took a test at the DMV .
At first , I went to the nearest DMV , but they turned down my application for driver 's license test , since my visa status was still in an extension phase .
Apart from that , since I also heard some bad rumors related to that DMV , I went tothe second nearest one from my apartment .
In the second one , they accepted my application .
I thought , maybe I should have come here in the first place .
Because some rules are different from Japan , such as , it 's legal to turn right on a red light here , so I studied and prepared well for both of tests .
He was strong bald guy with sunglasses and never changed his facial expression or smiled .
He reminded me of the Terminator - I hoped he would have said `` No problem `` .
When I was there , I was very surprised at many special products . I ca n't believe they can make it . I think they spent much time and money to make these hard work .
I am a designer , too . At the beginning , I ca n't do those products . But I will make more effort , I believe I can do it in the future .
I was very tired today , because I began working in the office after a 9 - day holiday .
For the whole holiday , I sat up too late and got up too late .
So I must readjust to my old schedule .
By the way , in Japan , old people like to work without any specific reason .
It 's rainy today .
I ate instant noodles because I did n't want to go out to buy lunch .
I can buy some food from them .
But it 's convenient especially during rainy days .
So it became rusty . Furthermore it 's leaking water .
And I rubbed off the rust with sand paper .
I and four Spanish girls went to Hyde park for a picnic .
One Spanish girl is leaving for London next week so I made Sushi for her .
She said she liked my Sushi .
We had some stuffs , drank too much and smoke .
We enjoyed today .
My listening range is wildfrom pop , rap , rock , to Jazz and classic .
Thanks to the internet .
Due to the abundant kinds , I will introduce them in the
First of all , we will talk about Taiwan 's pop music
Here I will list the famous singers in Taiwan for you
First one is Jay chou , I will say Jay is the pop king in Asia now .
He almost composes each song by himself in his albums and writes music for a bunch of Asia 's singers .
His music always gets good praise and great selling records .
the second one is Jolin , Most of her music style is close to the fast dance music .
That one brings people joy and good spirit genre .
What is the best , almost her published albums will create a new dance style and lead to the fashion among the young people .
I will introduce the rest of the artists next time .
I did n't know about this band until about 1 month ago .
My girlfriend recommended that I listen this band 's songs , and then I came to be into them .
Their sound , voices and lyrics are so good .
Here are two songs from that album .
Golden Week
Students , and others as well , are very happy because they have a lot of free time for play and going around to the places they wanted to go .
Even though many were happy there are also those who were not , and that was me .
My field of work does n't have these privileges .
teachers ' day
Korea has many special days in May .
Today is teachers ' day .
it falls on May 15th .
students nomally buy [ CROSS OUT ] conations [ / CROSS OUTcarnations and gifts and
visit their teachers .
I also visited my math professor and philosophy professor .
They both welcomed me ,
Please listen to my introduction ! !
My name is Yuki .
I 'm nineteen years old . ( 19 )
I 'm a second year college student .
I have been a member of soft tennis club for six years .
Of course , I like soft tennis the most .
But , I like vollyball , basketball and so on .
I often see Japanese movies .
I do n't watch foreign movies at all .
My dream is to work in travel company .
First of all , I want to study about Japanese tourist attractions .
Thank you for reading .
I have n't felt well since yesterday .
So I stayed in bed all day .
I think I 've caught a cold .
I have been very busy lately .
I have a Korean friend .
He speaks Japanese very well .
I think he is very cute ^ ^
But he is younger than me . . .
And I thought Korean men did n't chat .
I am interested in Korean .
Oh , I have a runny nose . . .
I cooked stir - fried vegetables with chicken today .
I grilled the / some chicken and seasoned it with sweet sake .
Then , I stir - fried it with some vegetables .
I am very happy when I can cook well .
Let me introduce myself . .
Hello . my name is Masha I am 18 years old .
I 'm busy because I have to finish several reports and a midterm report for my thesis .
Plus , I have exams . . .
I 'm practically dying . . .
But after these busy days are over , I have two months of Spring vacation ! !
I will work at school , but most of the time I will be free .
I am planning to travel , shop , read whatever book I want , watch movies , and see my friends .
By chance I was born as a Japanese woman . . .
people can go abroad or communicate on the internet more easily than ever .
However , as everyone knows , there still are so many people who are in extreme poverty . . .
In other words , only a small percentage of people can own personal computers and communicate with people all over the world .
And actually , this fact is quite strange for me . . .
The difference between rich and poor is based mostly just on which country they were born in !
I was born as a Japanese , but if I had been born in a poor nation , my life would have changed completely .
But I know there is no `` if `` in human life , we ca n't do anything but live our own lives . . .
As someone said , `` Do n't think too much about things that ca n't be changed . ``
Oh I just ca n't help but fall in love with this fantastic world .
I live on a small island country and it seems not too many people share my enthusiasm about star trek stuff .
The latest Star Trek movie is about captain Kirk and Spock .
But it 's totally worth it . . . . .
The city I live in has a warm climate .
But these days the weather is getting cold rapidly .
Many people prefer being warm rather than cold and I consider myself the most resolute one among them .
In these cold days , I just want to stay at home : home and dry , is there anything better than that ?
Unfortunately , I caught a cold last night .
Headache , nose clogged and cough , I hate them ! ! ! !
Maybe I will be healed after a sweaty dream . ( recover )
Today , I went swimming and ate ice cream after work .
I swam too hard / too much so I was exhausted .
It 's quite funny .
This menko card ' Harm of Building ' is assumed to have been printed in the 1930 's .
I can distinguish the printed era by the quality of the paper , printing and themes .
First , it 's very difficut to find menko cards printed in multi - color in the 1920 's or earlier .
Second , this could n't be in early 1940 's because themes that have nothing to do with the military could n't be allowed during WWII .
This could n't be in the later 1940 's because the quality of the paper and printing of this menko card is too good for that era .
Third , are there possibilities that it was printed in the 1950 's or later ?
Buildings were not an icon at that time .
Boys love something special in all of the times .
So , I conluded this menko ' Harm of Building ' was printed in the 1930 's .
In these days , kids ca n't have these kind of ' dystopia ' toys .
That 's the reason why I love menko !
It was a rainy day .
We shared an umbrella .
We had launch at a famous restaurant .
This restaurant is famous for `` handmade knife - cut noodles `` which contain short - necked clams and a variety of vegetables .
It exhibited a lot of relics and information about seoul history .
Around evening time , we went to the ' Shinchon ' .
' Shinchon ' is known as the `` street of youth `` .
There are many youthful people .
We were one of them .
We had dinner .
We ate food made from flour .
After we were full we took a walk .
I am in Los Angeles .
Now , it is 7 : 37 am .
Good morning everybody !
Now , there are many cars on the freeway of Los Angeles .
I will go to San Francisco today .
The athletic meeting at my son 's kidergarten is going to be held next week .
He did n't take part in the event because of the influenza disease last year .
Today , I met a foreign guest , he always go to shopping at morning !
So I very inquisitive to ask to him , are you a student ?
He said he is n't .
He came here for Learning boxing .
That 's so cool ! ! boxing ! !
It does not means I dislike them , I 'm just not interested in the contents they talk about .
Hence , I feel bored , when I hang out with them .
I enjoyed the time when I was in the English conversation club .
It not only improves my speaking , but also helps me absorbs some culture about the United States .
All of them require a great deal of time .
Long time no see .
I did n't post any journal last semester .
My summer holiday will end next Monday , so I need to go back to school .
( I was very disappointed that my last diary had no comments .
Therefore for the time being , I would like to keep my practice to an english diary . )
Today , I would like to talk about my anger to my manager in work place .
I work for an export and import company , and I have been working in an office for 3 years .
And he has been working there around 13years .
Our company used to have members of 9 people , but now we consist of only 3 members
I was noticing my manager 's stupidity and he gives me a lecture and says that I ca n't be such a stupid person when I am a senior in the future .
And I thought we could n't see his ability before due since it had been covered up to other people .
He likes to shift his work responsibility to someone else .
He ca n't decide anything and he always needs to make the way of his escape from any situation .
He always pretends that I know everything .
He used to speak negatively even when we were talking about jokes .
I am not great but his attitude is disgustting to work with . I just need to talk to ease the stress .
Someone told me that it will help to have good english speaking skills when you fight someone .
Congratulations on Your Graduation !
I changed my clothes to attend the ( more specific ) ceremony .
On my way to school , the rain changed into driving snow .
All graduates entered the high school assembly hall and they sat down in their seats .
The most impressive thing was that girl 's graduate 's message to all students .
The graduate 's parents were listening to her story with tears in their eyes .
She said she had belonged to a volleyball club .
Finally , they could take part in the volleyball games and they experienced victories and defeats .
I believe it 's experience was a great treasure and she 'll never forget her wonderful memory for the rest of her life .
My daughter also had great treasures and memories .
Start Lang - 8
Nice to meet you !
I 'm going to study in a language school in U , S , A .
Please teach me !
An India visa
Today I applied to the consulate for a visa for India .
I have been in Changchun for several days .
I saw a brown adult snake which had died beside a big banana field .
Dad told me it was not poisonous because its head was n't triangle - shaped .
That reminded me when of when I was a kid . . .
It has been a long time since I first saw a snake .
I still remember when I was a elementary student , I saw a dead Umbrella snake [ Bungarus multicinctus , ( Blyth ) ] .
That 's the first time I was so close to a poisonous snake , although it had already died .
My dad also told me lots of his experiences with snakes .
When he was a kid , he used to catch snakes regularly .
If the snake was poisonous , he would hit until it was dead and play with it for fun .
Or he might catch a non - poisonous snake , kill it and eat it .
He said he brought a non - poisonous snake to school , the snake is really big . He was caught by his teacher , which resulted in him being severely beaten by his teacher .
I asked him why he did that ,
and he said , when he was a kid he was never afraid , and did everything for fun .
But , he is a man now , and he would never do those things again .
I guess that 's because I learned one thing from this experience :
When people grow up , they gradually forget their instincts , or they become afraid of trying new things .
Rainy Season .
Rainy season has finished yesterday in Japan .
I often used moter cycle , but therain has prevent me to ride .
My English skills are poor , so whoever contacts me if you could please help me with my English , that 'd be great ! ( ^ _ ^ ) /
One of my favorite animes is `` Detroit Metal City ``
Detroit Metal City ( DMC ) is story about a musician , Negishi .
But after all , he 's singing in death metal band , Detroit Metal City .
He always complains about his band and he is always trying to quit it , but he is the perfect death metal singer on stage .
DMC also has wild fans .
Usually he is a really kind and naive guy , but when he is in DMC , he is evil .
This gap makes this anime funny .
It 's Friday night now in Japan !
I wanted to go out for drink somewhere , but I am still in my house .
I will watch `` 2012 `` on DVD for now .
This diary is being written for the first time .
I think that I will become accustomed to English on this site because it is not good at English either .
I will work hard so that the translation machine is not used as much as possible .
Please check if these sentences are correct .
She is a little short .
So her friends call her ' baby ~ ! '
She has big eyes , dark color hair and a skinny body .
I waited for her outside of her class so
we could met after her class was over .
We talked to each other while sitting on a bench near her class .
After a little while , we went to her dormitory .
I could make more friends because many of her friends were there also .
After we got to her room I helped her study Korean .
But it is hard to explain her questions because I ca n't speak English very well .
Besides her question were so difficult to explain in English .
Then , we went to the basement .
Surprisingly , there was a billiard table , some computers , sofas , a TV and some exercise machines .
The more time we spent together , the closer we became .
We made a plan to go to Han - River next Tueseday .
Snow and cherry blossoms
We had a little snow early this morning .
There were a few cherry blossoms still on the trees .
My husband wanted to take some pictures of the snow and cherry blossoms together .
Those pictures would have been very beautiful .
But the Yahoo internet service prevented him from realizing this goal .
The service was n't working when he went to use his PC .
So , he had to restore it immediately .
Unfortunately , the snow melted before he finished .
I seldom buy Japanese pop music CDs .
The Autumn Tomorrow . . .
I like the autumn season .
But I like summer more . . .
I want 90 more days of the sun . . .
I 'd love to play piano and trumpet , but I 've had no time to play them recently .
I want to improve my English .
Becasue I want to communicate with a lot of foreigners .
Communication among the different cultures and countries is interesting .
So , we can get more ideas , information , knowledge , and so on .
From now on , I hope I will improve with you .
I 'm not a history buff , so I did n't know about the black September or those terrorisms .
In addition , I have no idea about Jews or such kind of racism either .
I wish I would have had more knowledge , and it made me be interested in those issues .
In the Middle East and east Europe , these ethnic problems are still there , are n't they ?
I must do a lot of homeworks and reports !
Watching TV or DVDs ,
However , what I must do will make me very happy in the future .
If I can do it , I can feel a sense of accomplishment .
Most people want to avoid things they have to do ,
If I can finish it , I can have a better time to do what I do n't have to do ( I wanna do ) than not finishing it .
I will thought of procedure for my action profoundly !
Today is Wednesday ; New Year drawing near . This year , New Year and Valentine 's Day are on the same day .
My colleague will travel by plane tonight : how happy ! I also want to travel , but I do n't speak English and I have no money . Oh god , why are there so many languages in the world ? Why do n't we all use the same language ?
I also like Beijing Guo ' an and Darko Matic .
I have four soccer scarves : Beijing Guo ' an FC , Manchester United , Birmingham FC and Beijing Baxi FC .
But I lost my Manchester United scarves in Tianjin ! ! ! ! !
The characters ' personality is from ( depends on ) their nationality and customs .
The people from strong countries are usually a man or powerful woman .
Like in WW1 , England was the enemy of every country .
The enmity from opium problems with China ; the detachment with America ; always fighting with France since the beginning . . .
It 's very interesting and it makes you understand the history and geography of the world , plus a lot of other different things in different countries .
I love APH ! And Taiwan has a cute girl .
If you have seen this comic , you can talk with me about it .
but I can not speak a foreign language very well .
If I can speak English , Korean and Chinese , I will have a lot of friends .
Until last weekend , one of the previous tenants had lived with me , but my friend moved into the house last Sunday ! !
Actually , she has to go back to Japan at the end of August , but I want to hang out with her a lot until then .
Last weekend was busy .
I needed to go shopping , do landry , and visit my friend .
I think it was better than what I 'd had in Japan !
She gave me some advice .
If I really In order to do what I want , I should study much harder than now .
Maybe it is very hard to accomplish it .
However , she said I might be able to do it , so I should trust in myself and just do everything I can ! ! !
Are you familiar with Karaoke ?
Karaoke is the place whereby we can sing a song .
But karaoke has some meanings .
It 's too difficult for me to explain here .
In Karaoke there are many small box - type partitioned rooms .
We can sing in the room .
I like to sing with my friends .
However , I 'm not good at singing .
Many Japanese people like it .
Irrespective of age , from young to old , a lot of people go to Karaoke .
There are many Karaoke shops in my city .
Karaoke machines will grade the song for a person sang .
I want to sing very well .
Do you like to sing ?
Is there any Karaoke shop in your country ?
One of my aims of studying English is to have a good grasp of English poetic expressions .
By the way , I like Tanikawa Shuntaro in Japanese poetry .
( I know there already is a good translation but I will make a translation myself . )
I 've been learning hula for ten months , although I 've never been to Hawaii .
When I attended the first lesson , I found it was very tough . . .
Because I had to stay in a half - crouching position most of the time .
Anyway , I 've been addicted to it ever since and I 've been practicing very hard for the success of the rollout because it will be held on August 312008 .
However , while I was sitting up late , I ate too much ( again ) .
( I ate two cups of rice and two pieces of toast with chocolates .
And I drank a cafe au lait . ) And I ate too much for lunch today . . .
I went to a ramen shop with my friend , who is 2 years older than me .
And , in Japan , older friends often pay for both meals .
The noodles ( alone ) weighed 350g .
It was pretty yummy anyway .
So my stomach has been killed a couple of times the past 2 days .
Perhaps you are looking for talented Japanese architects with over three years experience in architecture school .
I am pursuing urban renewal techniques and landscape architectures , and I have a keen interest in algorithmic design .
My intention and experience provided me with a broad and unique vision for the new architectural field in China .
I graduated from Tokyo University of the Arts with Bachelor degree in architecture and I am pursuing a Master degree now .
I possess a strong skill of visual expression .
In 2007 , I had the opportunity to work full - time in the office of Professor Akira Kuryu ( Chiba University . ) for one year .
This experience provided me with valuable skills of the general building design processes .
Additionally , in the Jun Aoki office , I operated Rhinoceros and was involved in different projects such as assembling natural collages , and operating 3D fundamental forms on CAD software .
I have both technical knowledge and a good foundation of skills to quickly adapt to new technologies .
For instance , since I was familiar with the usage of machinery , I taught my colleagues how to use it .
From these work experiences , I realized fundamental skills and good teamwork are important factors in the success of architecture projects , which helped me a lot for the next job in this field .
I have strong communication skills to collaborate with teams and I am also confident in my skills .
My ability to deliberate solutions for problems has allowed me to consistently achieve goals .
For instance , at the Professor Kuryu 's office , when we designed the public hall , we worked with the government to find out the opinion of local residents .
I analysed these opinions and integrated them in my proposal of the final report .
This was agreed upon by all members and we could accomplish this project by following my proposal .
I am certain that my experiences and abilities , which are listed in my web page , would contribute to your projects .
This weekend , I will go to Niigata for the FUJI ROCK FESTIVAL 2010 .
I asked my friend today if it is possible I will get a good mark on my English speaking examination . I actually like to speak in English very much .
However , she was very serious when she told to me I will never get one of the best marks , because I make so many mistakes during English conversations .
Then I had to ask for myself whether it is a good thing to be honest at all , because her honest answer hurt me so much .
I know that lying is not a good thing . However , sometimes we need to tell a ' white lie ' , which is meant to comfort somebody else .
Being honest is very difficult as well , but she felt confident to tell me , because she has real concern for my well - being .
I am very grateful that she responded honestly . Now I can view my problem more objectively .
I am writing a diary for the first time .
I have been studying English because I want to speak with many different people .
My friends told me this site is good : )
There are several reasons why reading books is good .
There are alot of information we can get from books .
For example , science , literature , global , language , and so on .
In addition , you can broaden your perspective .
The more you read books , the more your communication skills can improve . .
I do n't have a reason for doing so . . .
Do you have a facebook account ?
In fact , I got my facebook account a while ago .
I think I 'm gon na update my facebook page .
( Today , I uploaded Mt .
If you are interested in it , I will let you access and accept your friend request : )
and I easily catch colds .
What I was surprised about is that the directors of the drama are gay even though it 's main characters are all women acting as housewives .
I thought it was made by female directors , but anyway it 's awesome .
considering the stories and mood of desperate housewives , the drama is fit to women .
I 'd like to use better expressions and correct words .
Today , I wanna talk about studying foreign languages .
Students in public schools have studied English since 7th grade in Japan .
( But my Korean is not good , I ' mstill a beginner level . )
Most Japanese colleges let their students study any foreign language except English .
We have to take other language classes . )
I wanted to study Korean at my college . But unfortunately , my college does n't offer Korean classes , so I took French .
Actually , I do n't like to study French because I 'm not very interested in France to begin with . I took it against my will because I had to choose one my college offered .
I 'm not fluent in any languages , but I 'm interested in other languages
Have you ever had this feeling too ? ( sounds more natural )
My mom said it 's not good for me , and she suggested that I should study other languages before I master one .
I indeed agree with my mom , but how do I deal with my desires ?
What do you think about this issue ?
If you are okay with it , please answer my questions .
Probably , most Japanese students are taught that sometimes `` were `` is used for the subjunctive mood .
If I were rich , I could buy whatever I wanted .
However my teacher told me that most Americans do n't use it .
I think that all languages are changeable every minute but I 'm confused .
Do you use `` were `` for the subjunctive mood ?
I hate examinations .
When I was a child , I was very good at it .
But I can not do it now .
After school , children practice it every day .
They are very good .
I should give myself more strength .
Hello , I 'm a new member on lang 8 .
I want to study English so I want to make friends with everyone .
Today I went to the eye clinic for a check up
Yesterday , I had an operation because of my shortsighted eyes .
My quality of vision has increased from 0 . 1 to 2 . 0 - it 's incredible !
The view from the train was very clear , just like photograph taken by a digital camera .
I was surprised by the recent improvements in medical technology .
Goodbye my glasses , thanks for all these years .
I wanted to watch a fun fantasy like `` Harry Potter `` yesterday but instead I watched a dark fantasy with a heavy theme .
The movie I watched today was really good .
It had a lot of elements like adventure , thrills , cute creatures , and so on .
I thought the twins were played by two persons .
They were completely different characters .
I would like to introduce myself .
I watched some movies .
Today was a holiday .
So , I went to the movie theater to watch some movies .
I watched two movies ; because , today is first day that we can watch movies for only 1000 yen .
We usually have to pay about 2000 yen .
I watched the Japanese movies `` My Darling is a Foreigner ' ' and `` Nodame cantarbire . ' ' Those movies were funny and impressive .
`` Nodame cantabire ' ' is one of my favorite movies .
It 's theme is music
and setting is in Paris .
I recommend it .
I think all of you have already heard of the Brazilian Carnival .
This highly anticipated holiday , celebrated for four days in February , invites people throughout the nation to celebrate according to their local culture .
They are organized artistic groups that prepare performances to be presented in great parades . At the parades Brazilians , as well as , tourists delight in the mesmerizing dance and music .
Whatever you choose , Carnival is a time to recharge your batteries in order to face the year ahead .
Is it possible to understand other people 's pain ?
I think we can imagine other people 's pain because of our past experiences .
For example , we know that it 's painful when a ball hits to my body quickly .
Because we learn that by experiencing that .
So when a ball hits other people 's body , I can imagine that it is painful .
But I can only imagine that .
A ball did n't hit my body .
A ball hitting other people 's body is not my experience .
So I ca n't understand .
How do you answer this question ?
The garbage was collected this morning .
I feel hopeless ! ! ! !
It 's been a week now , no one , no one , is willing to correct my essay , I 'm so sad .
When I got to my class building , one of my best friends in America was crying .
I asked what 's wrong with her , and then she told me that she just got a text from her mom saying that her grandma passed away .
I did n't know what was I supposed to say to her .
I did n't come up with any words that could make her feel better .
After the class was over , I got a call from my Japanese friend .
Her boy friend who she started dating only 3 days ago dumped her .
Probably saying nothing and listening to her talk was the best way to make her feel better .
It is sometimes really hard for me to think of what I should say when my friends are having a hard time .
Then I also looked up ' middling ' and could n't really see a difference between the two definitions
I was laughed class mate . My classmate laughed at me
But I decided to act rather than keep confusing myself .
Today I went shopping with my mother and brother .
My mother had come back after some months . She works in another city and visits us once every two or three months .
It is winter here , and my brother did n't take his coat because that morning it was sunny .
He should have taken his coat .
It 's took place one day during my childhood .
When I was a student in middle school , Though I had seen my friend 's father once in the bus , but I could n't recognize him .
So I did n't bow to him .
A few days later my friend who is a daughter of the man that I saw in the bus asked me why I did n't bow to her father ?
I was wondering I said `` I 've never seen your father `` .
`` My father said he saw you in the bus on that day . `` she replied
I wish for your attention ~
She sent me a text to say that she would be late .
Since I have to make some progress in my English writing skills .
Yesterday , I bought a new jacket online .
It was quite cheap .
So , I worried about the quality until it was delivered this morning .
It 's cloudy in Sapporo , it seems it will begin to rain .
It 's somehow nostalgic .
When someone says to you `` Nice to see you again , `` what do you reply ?
I am a university student .
My age is 19 .
I want to speak English , because my dream is to work in a foreign country .
Please help me with my English .
Give me your advice .
My biggest problem with college is that I get exhausted because I have a lot of things to do .
With this kind of life style , my fatigue accumulates day by day .
In conclusion , I will take a rest during my summer vacation , and recover my vigor .
I usually use excel at work ,
but my excel level is very poor too . . .
I have tried to write about sports , my family , and movies .
I have no idea what to write about these topics .
However , I have to submit it in this evening .
I think what I write about ( the topics ) is not good . My lecturer said it was rubbish .
What should I do to write well ?
I 'm a boy , I 'm 21 , and I 'm from China .
I want to make some friends with this !
It has been about 4 months since my last checkup .
The dentist told me that I do n't have any cavities as yet .
I sometimes forget or fail to brush my teeth , but fortunately I have had no cavities since I began going there and I get my tartar removed on a regular basis .
The dentist and assistants always manageto find a way to relax children .
For example , they put a TV in front of the patient 's chair and play the DVD of ' Tom & Jerry ' while the child is ( being ) examined .
I 'm afraid that the parents confuse Tom 's shriek with their child 's . lol !
I heard an ambulance siren , but the siren stopped soon .
I went outside and saw the ambulance stopped at the condominium near here .
After a while , ( maybe in 20 minutes ) , I went outside again and noticed the ambulance was still there .
Learning a foreign language is one of the most difficult yet most rewarding experiences of my life .
So since I entered university , I have always been listening to real English voices to improve it .
The Penguins of Madagascar is my favorite cartoon , and I learned a lot from it .
my task at work was finished this year and so I cleaned up around
I was so tired .
I was doing some wedding - related work suterday .
There were 5 different couples getting married .
I took some medicine and slept early .
Then , yesterday I went to Shiga to help out with a choral society 's regular concert .
I felt a little tense when I read the congratulatory messege .
since I was busy 2 days , I went to a `` sento `` ( Public bath ) today !
I feel so relaxed .
I think `` sento `` is a nice part of Japanese culture .
I returned to my home .
I went to Thailand 6 days ago and I arrived in South Korea yesterday .
When I arrived in Thailand , I could not breath because the temperature was over 40C , but I had a precious time in Thailand .
I could feel that Thai people are very kind and have a positive mind .
There were several beautiful places and many delicious foods , which were very economical .
Sometimes I got into a ' Tuk Tuk ' , which is a Thai transportation .
It shook heavily , but it was very fun . The Thai 's McDonald mascot had a different pose from other countries .
I had a great time in Thailand and I will never forget my trip .
I attached the photos of Thailand , which were taken by my film camera ( Konica pop ) .
Do you believe in reincarnation ?
She is one person who believes in reincarnation .
It was a white dog , and my mother loved it so much .
However , when it was 8 years old , it got sick .
She was worried about it and took care of it a lot , but it died .
Of course , all of us felt sad and cried , because we loved it so much .
My mother especially felt so sad that she said to the dog 's dead body `` If you will be able to be reborn , you should be a human 's baby next time . ``
After 20 years later , I gave birth . my daughter and my mother was very glad about that .
And she asked my daughter , `` Do you remember this ? ``
When I looked at it , I was so shocked because it was the bowl which our dog had used before .
Of course , my daughter was upset , and could n't understand what she meant .
Therefore she started to explain about the bowl `` It was the bowl which you used when were my dog . I have wanted to meet you as a human being for a long time .
Do n't you remember that bowl ? ``
My daughter answered `` I do n't remember well .
When she heard my daughter 's answer , she seemed to be disappointed .
When I was in Okinawa , I could see the clouds differently .
They looked like they were raised in the sky .
The sparsely raised clouds in the sky amplified the uncanny atmosphere with twinkling stars .
It seems to me that nature there was different from that of big cities such as Tokyo .
Therefore our eyes were naturally riveted on its indigenous nature .
Even after soaking in the sea , the sunbeam promptly evaporated the water from our soggy clothes .
And its original culture enriches harmony between human and nature .
Okinawa has some remote isles around it .
And I found myself looking at a carriage towed by a water buffalo at one of the isles .
A man on the carriage was playing music unique to Okinawa , which is commonly sung in Okinawa songs .
I have just mademy mind to participate in international exchange .
I know my spoken english is not well , so that 's why I 'm here : ) It will be great to find somebody who knows english very well and wants to learn russian .
For example , the number of the heinous crimes like homicides has been increasing , and it 's been getting / becoming more difficult to get a job recently .
Not to mention , the economic crisis is still continuing , which has led to many bankruptcies .
There are even several cases of abuse by a parent .
One of the reasons is the fact that more mothers need to go to work now than before . See note .
In the future , I 'm sure human relations will be weaker than they are now .
A gigantic earthquake struck Tohoku district in Japan yesterday .
I did n't feel it at where I 'm living .
At first , I could n't believe what I was seeing on TV .
The tsunami was sweeping out countless cars and houses .
Although I have some relatives in Tohoku district , I ca n't get in touch with them .
Many members of my class will turn 20 years old soon .
When we become 20 years old , we can drink alcohol and smoke in Japan .
Sometimes I 'm confusing and I ca n't manage to reply to questions in English .
Sometimes I ca n't follow the questions , sometimes I ca n't choose the right words .
The old master living in this house thought , `` Because of this sudden rain , many people will come to borrow umbrellas . ``
But if I lend umbrellas one after another , however many I may have , it wo n't be enough .
So you receive visitors and refuse to lend umbrellas to them . `` And he went into a room .
Tokusuke , who lived in the next town , ran in and said , `` Could you please lend an umbrella ? ``
Yotaro answered straight , `` If I lend umbrellas whenever I am asked , however many I may have , it wo n't be enough .
I wo n't lend you one .
I have them on the corner of the shelf . ' Understand ? ``
Please lend me your cat . ``
The man was surprised to hear this , and went home .
After another short while , the master living on the street came in and said , `` Excuse me .
I have things to discuss with your master . ``
I 'm so excited and also nervous today , because this is the first time that I logged on to Lang - 8 , and that is why I 'm nervous . My English is not very good I ca n't speak with a foreigner and I ca n't even speak with my classmates .
The purpose of applying for this account is because I want to improve my English and I want to make more friends with people from all over the world .
I know there are many differences between the eastern and the western culture . I also want to learn about it .
So , I hope you can help me , and I 'll be very happy if I can be your friend .
Ah . I like humman b - box very much . If someone who has the same hobby as I have , we can communicate with each other .
I am very thankful to Lang - 8 for giving us a communicaton platform .
Are they dead or alive ?

I 'm taking night classes after work in a public school .
For now , I enrolled for the next three months .
After this session , I 'll consider whether I should keep up with the class or not .
The class is OK so far ; it 's not difficult .
I went to a temple today with my friend , Dora .
Both of us got really bad fortunes .
Although I told her `` Just forget about it , it does n't matter `` ,
I asked about both love and study ,
and the fortune said `` Do n't go forward . . .
That 's really awkward .
I ca n't hate my cousin no matter what happens .
A few months ago , I got an idea about how to bring my cousin here .
You know , speaking English is also important in Korea .
Actually , we do n't speak English in our country .
But , when we try to get a job , we will be tested in English .
Anyway , when he first came here he had n't got his own car , so he used to borrow my car .
Sometimes he wanted to drive my car when we went somewhere together .
He nearly killed me three times .
For example , when we were on the highway , he was driving at 110km .
But he did n't watch the road , as he was interested in some cows which were on the side of the highway .
He crossed the middle line .
At that time , a car was coming in the opposite lane .
But , he did n't know that until I screamed out .
It was too dangerous .
There are even more stories I can tell .
I think I have already said too much .
We will talk about this again later .
Our middle daughter was crying when we tried to put her in bed yesterday .
Either my wife or I need to take care of our youngest daughter , so she sometimes has to sleep alone .
While she was crying , I just finished putting our youngest daughter to bed then I took care of her .
I will present a solution for a problem in the textbook !
However , the problem is difficult for me !
Recently , I 've been worriedabout what I want to do in my future , so I am depressed and have been just concentrating on studying !
My present worry is about what kind of jobs are suitable for me .
I noticed recently that I do n't like studying alone , so being a researcher or professor seems unsuitable for me .
So I will work in a big name maker ( large company ? ) and make plans for new products .
Or maybe I will work in a bank because I have a skill for math and could use it .
However I have much time to make a decision , so I have focus what I have to do now .
Time is running out !
So I will try my best to do what I can do now !
I am a unviersity student . I am 21 years old . I want to practice my English .

Almost all People said `` It 's very useful and exquisite ! ``
So I will exert effort in order to understand it .
My fasebook journey starts today .
I 'll be a college student after this summer holiday , which make me excited , full of pride and hopeful / hope .
College life is also preparation for future careers .
Although there are people who attend college just to fulfill their parents ' wish and get the diploma , I think that wasting time in college to play computer and so on is not a smart idea .
Learning and practicing the skills which we will need in the future is essential
All of us wanna have a happy life and a good career with high income , so most of us want to attend to college to realize our dream .
Therefore we should grasp every second in college .
First , I 'm sorry for my poor English .
We have been given huge support by many countries .
Thank you so much for your warm - heartedness ! !
I love you , friends ! !
Fortunately I did n't feel the huge shaking .
Keep going ~ ! ! ! Keep going ~ ~ ! ! !
Where there is a will , there is a way !
From now on , I 've decided to memorize some English words every day .
I think that vocabulary is the base of English .
I had been studying English at school in Japan since I was in junior - high school until now , in university , but I still ca n't speak English fluently .
It has been said that Japanese education 's serious problem for a long time , and it was made by English teachers .
Because most of Japanese school 's English teachers ca n't speak English fluently , they ca n't teach English like a native speaker .
Of course they have good teaching skill , but I think the most important aspect of English education is how to communicate , because language is tool communication .
Even though Japanese students have been studying English for 6 or 10 years is school , they ca n't form good relationships with foreigners for the lack of speaking skill .
The Japanese government has been encouraged to improve English teacher 's training for decade .
The ministry of education have been trying to employ foreigner English teachers instead of Japanese teachers for raise a English education 's quality , otherwise it was hardly functional in Japan .
I went to the beauty salon to change my hair color .
My hair became bright and I like my new color .
But all my friends , even my family
I have a part time job at a supermarket .
Yesterday , I got a higher salary than I expected .
It makes me happy but I want to earn more money .
I want to travel to Australia to see my friend .
I want to go abroad !
I have a muscle ache since I went on a 10km jog yesterday .
I should n't have tried overdoing it : - (
Yesterday 's weather was cloudy and snowy .
I went to a cafe with my frend .
I ate a delicious cake and drank tea .
The U .
S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Japan lately .
While I was watching the news piece , I noticed a certain thing .
I know , of course , that she was trying to speak clearly and slowly so the audience could comprehend what she meant or wanted to say . . .
Her speech may be a good substitute for a text book to improve our listening skills
This is the third time I 've writen : ) As the title says , today is my birthday and I am 21 !
Anyway , my friend gave me pieces of cake and a message card for me .
The card said that keep good friendship between us and she hopes I will have a good day .
I swear to myself that I will also make her happy in her birthday as well .
I 've lived in Tokyo for a long time .
I have a question , if you went to Tokyo , where would you recommend to go ?
I 'm very tired and sleepy cuz I only slept 3hours last night .
I just finished class and the next lesson will start in 4hours .
I may sleep until the class starts but I have to study traffic rules to pass the exam . . . . .
recently there has n't been any change in my life .
I want to go drinking , dancing , play tennis and many other things .
moving is troublesome for me .
but it seems fun to live in a place where I 've never been .
anyway , I have many things I have to do .
first of all I will try to go to bed .
Today was an extremely nice day .
There was sunshine and the weather was like spring .
I really wanted to hang out with my friends but I didn ' t
Because yesterday when I was playing baseball with my baseball team ,
I hit my face against the other team 's player .
I was really hurt ,
and I got a black eye .
I did n't want to show my face to other people .
So I was studyig English and watching `` LOST `` ( American Drama ) in my home .
Despite the fact that I did n't hang out with my friends , I was happy
I was so nervous from start to finish that my face was ( or became ) drenched with perspiration ( I must 've looked uglier than usual . . . ) and some questions I had prepared for the interview slipped my mind .
On my way home , I was already beginning to give up on the job and decided to go to the Employment Service Agency tomorrow .
Although what I desperately want now is a full - time job , I opted to accept the offer right away .
After all , I need to make a living .
Anyway , after working part - time for a two month period of probation , the company will see if I 'm suitable for the position .
So , from now on , I have to learn a lot of technical terms for clothing to translate the company 's web site and documents and so forth into English .
Could anybody tell me any helpful web sites to learn about these terms ?
my trouble with learning English
With my spare time , I have been studying english at an international english school since Dec , 2007 .
but to my disappointment , I have found that I have not made any obvious progress , especially with my listening and oral skills .
although I can read some english articles and write some simple e - mails in english now , it is still very difficult for me to communicate with foreigners in english .
howcan I improve my english listening level in a shortamount of time ?
who would like to give me some useful advice ?
Today , when I were surfing internet , I found this journal .
I am going to translate it . ( more natural )
He graduated from the high school which I graduated from .
In the Southern Kanto , there were only two DPJ statesmen who could retain their seats in constituencies , Kan Naoto of Musashino City of Tokyo and Noda Yoshihiko of Funabashi City of Chiba .
This is the reason why he was considered as a new leader of DPJ .
My nearest railway station located on the border of Funabashi and Narashino Cities .
Many statesman frequently appears there , and Noda often speaks to voters at the station in the morning .
I have always voted for him in elections , but I know nothing about his policies , because he says nothing about them .
He studied politics at a famous university , so he certainly has a lot of policies .
However , he does n't show his policies clearly to the voters , because policies make enemies .
He is eager to help voters , but obviously , he does n't like talk about ideological matters .

I went to my English class .
Our company held a get - together today .
We ate pork ribs .
They were delicious .
Now I am going to sleep .
I just joined Lang - 8
I just joined Lang 8 XD
I do n't know what to write here .
But I 'm trying .
Everybody , please help me .
I wish Winter would come faster . . ^ ^
Last year I started learning snow boarding .
It was the first time in my life to go to a skiing ground .
At first I just skiied , but 2 hours passed and I became uninterested .
Changing to a snow board was really fantastic .
Taking a ski lesson for 1hour was o . k , but snowboarding was ( both ) very , very difficult and very interesting .
For the first time I bought equipment .
The weather has been so hot that I really miss winter ,
when everything becomes white .
It was not so common here in Japan to change jobs about 20 years ago .
My first job - change was at that time .
However , to tell the truth , I wanted an easy way to escape from difficult problems .
When I had to face such problems , I strongly felt that it was a waste of time to keep trying .
I 'm apt to hope that great results would come .
But great achievements are not ( often ) obtained easily .
If someone 's success is shining brightly , I can just see it .
It sounds like a simple thing , but it 's difficult for me .
When I think that solving a difficult problem will be impossible , it will probably turn out to be true .
I should quit worrying about whether or not I might fail and just keep on doing it once if I have started .
Some hold the view that it is not needed to increase teachers ' salaries in order to improve the quality of education , because they firmly believe that a major part of students ' education is the students themselves .
However , from my everyday experience and observation , I can state several factors to defend the statement that increasing teachers ' salaries can improve the quality of education .
First , a well paid occupation can attract many people to be a teacher . It follows that many people with a doctorate are willing to be a professor in universities .
There is no doubt that a doctor has more sophisticated eucational skills than a graduate since he had more studies and teaching experiences .
For example , my school is just an average college , but it offers the teachers a high salary .
In this case , the teachers inculding professors and teaching assistants mostly have a doctorate or two .
And thus the quality of education in our university improve sharply , as well as our good reputation .
Second , increasing the teacher 's salary can inspire them to do their best .
It is the same as a boss increasing an employee 's salary .
The teachers are the ones that want to keep their salary in a stable stuation , and must satisfy their students and the dean .
The need to prepare their course carefully and introduce new and interesting methods to educate students .
In a word , increasing the teachers ' salaries is the best way to improve the quality of education .
Because many qualified people will want to become teachers with a high salary and inspire them to do their best .
I work for a baby cloth company as PR .
I used to live in FL and LA as foreign student .
Recently or Nowadays , I do n't have chance to speak and write in English , so this will be good opportunity to keep the skill for me .
I hope everyone see this and correct this .
Most of Japanese domestic Companies have the five - day workweek system , and the holidays are Saturday and Sunday .
The good point is that everywhere I go are not so many people .
The Bad point , However , is that I have a work on Saturday .
Most of my friends have day offs on Saturday and Sunday ,
If you live in an Asian countries , it 's easier to take a trip to Korea than those who do n't live in Asia .
It 's actually been said that a trip to Korea is cheaper than a domestic one .
If you only want to enjoy nice Korean foods , you do not necessarily have to go to Korea .
Because there 's always been a so - called Korean town in Tokyo ! !
I went to Korean town and had a really nice Korean BBQ tonight with my colleagues , which reminded me of visiting Korea about two years ago !
Yesterday , I was so tired and went to bed early .
But because a friend sent me an SMS telling me he was sick
I was worried about him and could not sleep well .
Ah , hope that he will feel better soon .
Yesterday , I read a Japanese comic book ( MANGA ) called `` GAKU `` .
It 's a story of a mountain rescue team member named Sanpo .
He is a very strong climber who had climbed many famous mountains in the world .
Furthermore , he is known for his kindness .
Sanpo would never scold at careless climbers .
Instead , he would tell them `` You did your best .
Let 's come back to the mountains again once you 're cured ! ``
I argue with my wife because we have some differences between us .
I wish I could be like him .
I 'd like to encourage my students in English when they do their homework .
What can ( should ) I say to them ?
I would be very happy if you could give me some ideas .
Those who do n't know this disease may feel frightened just to hear about it , but it 's one of the skin diseases that children often suffer from .
This disease causes red rashes on the hands , feet , and mouth and even on the ass .
He got many rashes and has a high fever .
Now he 's getting better , but I feel really sorry to see my son 's body full of the rashes .
I studied English about 8 years ago .

She told me that I can practice english here
My name is Una , I have trouble in english , and I really want to improve it .
Correcting my poor english will takes you lots time , I hope you do n't mind .
It is true that hunting whales is japanese tradition .
Before seeing this movie , I would never feel like that because eating whale is japanese old custom and tradition like french eat rabbits and frogs , escargos .
Fishermen and their families are thankful for whales .
And they prey for the whale and they have a festival for apprecaite to the whale .
It is not easy for everyone to kill ANY animal for eating , they hunt the whale with hard pain for their life , that is earning money .
They cover the blue seat above the sea not to show killing whales after the movie was broadcasted because they think the scene of dieing should not be shown like human being does n't show their face to all people when they die .
Fishermen do n't break any international law .
What right do Sea shepard have to criticize them personally .
They should critisize the hunting to the whale in itself in right way .
They just make fishermen angry by taking photos and videos with persistence and they get the scene fisherman is mad at them .
It is definitely unfair .
What do you think about hunting whales ? ?
In Japan , there lives quite a number of cockroaches .
They are so scary that even a sight of one makes me thrill .
3years ago no less than 4 cockroaches appeared in my room at the same time .
My skin became itchy and turned red .
The insecticide was too strong .
The things I like most
I like risks and new things .
New things always fascinate me .
I think every changes have the reasons and sometimes , the changes help me grow up ( matures ) .
I like risks because risk brings out the best in oneself .
the life that you see is wonderful .
This is the internet making it possible to integrate human intelligence all over the world .
However there are 2 people , those who post the information 's on the net and those who use the information on the net .
Myself included .
So I wonder who will give the comment on this diary .
My youngest daughter woke me up and asked me to take her down to the living room this morning .
I wanted to sleep more , but I decided not to go back to sleep and do some work .
There were many people there because it 's Higan in Japan .
We ate a late lunch at a restaurant near the station .
As we got back home and I was entering our house , my youngest daughter wanted to play in the garden out the front .
So I weeded the garden while she was playing .
It was an ordinary day , but I still think it was a good one .
I went to the Guns and Roses concert at the Tokyo Dome last night .
The sound system was messed up !
Probably , it was because of the area where I was seated .
I guess the speaker system could not reach our area ( very ) well .
In addition to that , it was too cold in the venue and so on . . .
Anyway , I was happy to hear famous tunes from their past albums .
Today I joined an English school .
Its the kind where students talk to a teacher living in Philippines by Skype phone ( IP telephone ) .
Its costs 5000 yen .
Its very cheap when compared to a normal English school .
I can hear the teacher 's voice clearly , but it is difficult to understand what the teacher says when its only by voice .
I worked hard without much success , because the topic was too difficult and complicated to describe .
The textbook quoted from a lot of papers , so I was really confused trying to make sense of the outline .
I was n't satisfied my presentation though I like drinking after every effort none the less ^ ^
I want to do better next time .
A huge job hunting event will be held this weekend at a large convention hall in Tokyo .
So I made reservations for an overnight bus and hotel .
I was too late to make reservations , so it was very difficult to find them , especially an overnight bus .
As for a hotel , I 'll stay at a hotel which has hot springs .
However , I can stay there at a reasonable price .
I 'm looking forward to visiting there .
I hope I 'll be motivated through this event .
Today , I could n't explain a British person why TOEIC is more famous than IELTS .
I said `` TOEIC is the main examination in Japan , so many shops have got a lot of TOEIC text book , a only a few IELTS . ``
I 've had difficulty , especially in writing because I have n't received proper feedback .
I also want to help people who wish to learn Korean .

but I ca n't see the sea .
I want to see the sea .
Now , Japan is in a critical situation .
I think spilling radioactive water to the sea is a catastrophe .
There might be no choice about that , but I ca n't understand why they did it .
Maybe if they did n't , the power plant would have exploded ? ?
What is worse is that the Japanese government is trying to control information in this internet age .
And I know many people are worrying about it .
I really appreciate that .
But I really want to know what foreign people are thinking about this situation in Japan .
Chinese is so fun .
Japanese also uses Kanji , so I think it 's a little easier for Japanese people to remember Chinese words .
But it 's difficult to pronounce and to understand .
It takes a long time for me to remember English words , but I often already know the meaning of a Chinese word the moment I see it .
Today after my Chinese class , my teacher asked me to come to his desk .
I thought , `` Did I do something bad . . . ? ``
But he said , `` You study so hard , but your pronunciation is a little incorrect , so I 'll teach you . ``
Sounds like you 've had a good time in Africa ! !

Even though I still want my other umbrella back . . .
My company 's client had the following requirements for the blog ;
To make and embed a blurry picture on the website .
To focus on some but not all parts of their hair salon .
Basically I always listen to all the requests from a client and try my best to achieve the goal exactly the way the client imagines in her mind .
However , this time the client was very strict about the whole layout in detail , because they themselves take care of their own clients ' hair style everyday and are very specific about the image they are trying to portray on their website .
It took us thee months to complete it and we , our designers , coders and I , have just finished making it . I felt a great sense of relieve when we finally completed it !

For instance I did n't learn any words about Baseball .

We all had a long talk , you know , talking about the past , the present , and of course , future projects .
Going back home , I thought she was the perfect wife for Richard , and hoped that she could help him manage his terrible mood .
Eat at Home or Eat Out ?
I think your answer is `` Yes , of course . ``
It 's not easy to cook e complex dishes because cooking is a high technique job requires certain techniques .
I seldom invite my friends to eat at home . I am not confident in my cooking skills , although my friends would not mind , even if I only made noodles .
Making a delicious food is a difficult . You need to know what kind of ingredients and tools , needed to prepare the recipe , and you need to know how to select , use , and cook these ingredients .
In China , there are thousands of various ingredients l and cooking methods .
Even if the material is the same , the taste may be variant from different vary by cooking method and chef .
For example , fish can be cooked by frying , steaming , or salting , etc .
The side - dish could be any kind of vegetables or even traditional Chinese herbs .
So As you can see , it is not easy to cook such nice dishes at home . If you invite a friend for a meal , I suggest you go to a restaurant or a chophouse .
As a second consideration option , most Chinese people invite friends to eat out when they hold celebrations , such as birthday parties or relationship building parties .
In these situations , the host usually pays the bill . The custom is different from Western custom . ' .
For this reason , doing this would be considered stingy , because you will spend less money , or and the next time your friends invite you to a restaurant , you will feel like you owe them something .
Finally , eating out can be considered convenient and saves more time to chat or do other things .
Eating out could take less than one third of the time that eating at home takes . That is , if taking it takes twenty minutes to eat at a restaurant , it would take one hour at home .
Eating out means there is no need to wash dishes and cleaning work or clean after a meal .
Especially when you invite a lot of people for a meal , eating at home would be too much work .
It was such a huge so much work that I remember it even now .
Now , in my hometown , many such parties would be held in restaurant for convenience .
There are many reasons to support my view that eating out is better than eating at home , especially when you inviting friends for a meal .
It was very very delicious ! !
But I worry about putting on weight . . .
I have to go on a diet . . .
I got my hair cut at beauty salon .
I like my hairstyle .
Hi , my first diary : )
Hi , let me introduce myself .
I do n't know what I should write in my diary , so I want to look back at today .
I got up at about 8 o ' clock in the morning .
I 've been studying English for a long time , but I ca n't speak it very well .
I surfed the Internet and saw a cooking site yesterday .
I found some recipes and they looked so good .
One of them is lasagna .
I tried making lasagne for the first time and it was delicious .
I have a bread maker so I knead pasta by the machine .
I made a meat sauce and a white sauce .
I took the photo after I started eating .

Of course , if a student 's cell phone rings during class , it bothers other students .

My boss came to the company today .
Usually I must know before she comes or not , but today she did not tell me or the employees in the office that she was coming .
I was eating like crazy . I was surprised to see her walk by and look my way .
I must eat my food quietly .
She told me she wanted Chinese tea .
I must take care of my boss because the wife house did not come today .
I never really did that for her when I began my job .
The first time she asked me I felt very confused .
In the afternoon I asked her about the food she wanted me to buy , she said she can eat a whole rice and soup dish .
After I head out , I hurry to buy the food for her , but I could not find the food she wanted .
She laughed about the food .
You can imagine if you ate the same food everyday you would become bored , I think she felt that way but she did n't say .
I 'm happy to write in English in the same day .
Take care .
and after today if must remember to not buy rice with pork for her .
Hello , my wonderful friends . Today is someones birthday . .

I started it because I would like to have more opportunities to speak English , and the online lectures are cheap !
If I go to a language school and talk with a native speaker , it would cost more than 30000yen ( about $ 350 ) a month , but the online one costs just 3000yen ( about $ 35 ) per month .
My employment during my childhood .
I was occupied by many hobbies and amusements : Greco - Roman wrestling ( 1year ) ; karate , boxing , football ( few months ) ; and my favorite aero - modelling ( for some years ) - it drove me crazy and currently I love aircrafts & any air machinery .
Also , I like my home computer , was studying how it works and other technology .
When I was in my group of aero - modelling there was a group of radio lovers .
I never liked how they sat in their places and soldered all time .
When I grew up I thought about my profession and after that I finished my studies at the radio faculty at an university ! ) because I had entered that faculty on free education .
Currently I work in the radio industry as a junior engineer and I solder almost all day in my job .

The learner can practice their second language with a native speaker who is learning their language .

I spent some days here in Akita , eating and sleeping . .
Since my grandma and grandpa are incredibly smart , they had a great job like they are both government employees here in Akita .
My grandma also had done many hobbies and activities when she retired last ten years ago .
I really admire her because she keeps challenging and trying herself to test how far she can go .
It 's been so long since I last spoke in English .
Today I talked with a guy whom I met on Lang - 8 .
He could speak English , so our conversation was held in English but I was reminded of how my speaking skill is bad .
Sometimes I am told that my written English is good . So people tend to think my level of speaking is high , but it is definitely not .
When sitting in front of a mic , I ca n't start conversation .
Is this because of my English skill ? Or . . .
I can give you terrible `` Engrish `` sounds .
I enjoyed myself today .
I went bowling with tennis club members .
We split into two teams and played a match in two games .
After that , we went to Gyuhan ( grilled meat shop ) to have dinner .
By the way , I went to get a haircut to the hair salon at noon .
I 'm tired now .
but I do n't want to watch it right now .
I had sufferd on line . please elaborate ?
I found a nice song that I like .
I sometimes study English by listening to songs .
So I tend to choose slow ballad songs .
I like this song because of the title .
This sounds like English to me .
We never express feelings like this in Japanese .
This is a woman 's song but the lyrics have a deeper meaning for me .
I want to be able to say someday , `` I have been to me . ``
It was one of the happiest days two days ago since I came to the U .
That 's because I passed my driver 's license test !
I know many people think that passing and having a driver 's license is
I 've never driven a car in Japan . Even more so , I 've never had any trouble
with transportation , because my hometown Yokohama is very
conveniently located near public transportation .
Students normally start taking English classes as early as preschool and this continues even after they become college students .
It 's not difficult to spot thousands of parents tightening their belts in order to send their kids to private language institutes .
My English name is miban .
l like to make friends with other people .
These days l want to learn Japanese , though l do n't know anything about it at all .
So I want to make some friends to teach me as well as to improve my English .
Would you like to be my friend ?
My First Entry
I started using Lang - 8 to learn writing in English .
Maybe , I will make many mistakes in my entries .
But I have to be fluent in English by next year .
Because I 'll be an employee of a company making electric appliances .
English skills are necessary for the job .
I want to obtain the skill of a student .
If you help me learn English , I will help you learn Japanese .
Glad to read my entry .
Life is shorter than I thought .
I am 21 years old but I have never thought about my future seriously .
I saw that others have got their own final distination .
Some succeeded , some are still trying hardto achieve their goals .
This made me want to be serious with my life .
Everyone have got dreams .
I also have dreams , but they are impossible to achieve soon .
I will tell you about one of my dreams .
I want to study aboard where I can focus on the major I 'm interested in .
I counld n't tell them about this , I just kept it in my mind .
There are 5 persons in my family .
Theyare not rich enough to send me study aboad and I dont want to be selfish .
As time passes by , It seems thatI have got the good things from my parent more than my sister and brother got .
After class I just took the elevator down to the building with my listening class teacher and two of my classmates .
One of my classmate turned to ask the teacher on how to improve our listening skill .
The teacher said that we should listen to the material over and over and try to figure out all the words and sentences after class .
If we still ca n't figure out some words - especially the technical words - after listening it over and over again , we have to try to write it down and look it up in a dictionary .
Most of all , he emphasized that we better not read the script from beginning to end .
That 's what I learned today .
I 'm working in a publishing company , and our section publishes monthly wedding information magazine / flier .
Now I am joining in a project to study about the wedding markets of foreign countries , especially of China .
We discuss the trend of overseas wedding of Chinese couples ; in Japan there are few religious wedding ceremonies , so some Japanese couples choose the overseas wedding , for example they hold ceremonies in Hawaii , Guam , and so on .
I must interview some couples who had already held the overseas wedding .
I think their fresh voices are / will be the most important hint for my project .
9 : I want our garden to be full of pink flowers in spring .
I foundthat most people who study Japanese like Japanese cartoon .
I 'm not really interested on manga and anime .
So I 'm going to know more about these category .
It means to insist on something no matter any difficulties that may come up .
The evaluation is not real because there is not anyone else to say so .
I always go to work by bicycle ,
but today I went on foot because it rained .
My ft got really soaked h .
