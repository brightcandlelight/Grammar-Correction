And he took in my favorite subject like soccer .
Actually , who let me know about Lang - 8 was him .
His Kanji 's ability is much better than me .
We 've known each other for only half a year , but his lesson was a lot of fun .
I heard a sentence last night when I watched TV .
When you go downhill , you have to stick out your chest or you will fell down .
When you go uphill , you hvae to bend your back .
It is like when you are confronted with frustration , you have to keep your confidence .
When you are go smoothly , you have to be more modest .
When I was at school , we painted a lot of wooden handicrafts like small plates and cases .
The making souvenir is a hard and interesting work .
Well , finally , my mother took me to the customs window , she gave a passport to man . . .
That 's two balls : one with a cat inside , other with dog .
You know , you can take them at slot machine .
The third memory is the house we lived .
It was situated near Helsinki , big and light house with the small lake behind it ( it was winter , so it was frozen ) .
Do n't know why .
I liked the winter Finland .
And I hope I like the summer Finland .
Just improvise already ! `` To tell the truth , I myself did n't expect what I CAN play like that I did .
If only I had black dense curtains .
A couple of weeks ago , I heard a new Whitney Houston 's tune on my car radio .
I had been wondering what she was doing .
It said that was disappointing .
Old and not beautiful . . . . .
I know her tumultuous marriage with Bobby Brown and an arduous battle with drug addiction .
Still she has n't recovered from them ?
More disappointing thing to me is she said the reason of her bad voice was because she talked with Oprah Winfrey too much on her show .
That might be one of the reasons , however , it sounds like just an excuse .
I would say after 10 years of waiting , it has not failed its title , at least from my first impression .
Anyway , I think I 'll spent quite some playing it in the next few weeks .
OK , let 's all for my first entry .
Before , I went to a library .
On the way I had a headache .
So , I think if we have to go somewhere on foot , we must put our hat .
If we did n't that and walk for long time , we will collapse or die .
If my sentences are n't practical correct them .
This morning I found out that one of my favourite band released his new album .
I already forgot about Rise Against an it is a great surprise for me , because I did n't return to them for 2 years .
I hope this band did n't become worse yet like many others big ones and I 'll enjoy listening it .
Well , there remains to get it and check it out .
It 's because my mum is probably the best cook I have met in my life .
Cooking is not her profession , she is a housewife .
I have ate at hotels and expensive meals but they are nothing like what she cooks .
I rather be working outside than be a housewife .
I think it 's about for one and half year .
I should have exploded whole this building so that I can make them destroy ~ ! ! !
I had to write about counseling .
This is my first time to write diary on the internet .
I hope someone see my diary and correct it .
I watched DVD `` Grey 's anatomy `` today .
Actually I keep watching it these days .
So there are a lot to see .
I do n't know medical word in English very much .
But I can study English through this .
And I think it 's fun , right ?
And I 'm eating a banana every day for my health .
The banana is gather in my stomach and gives me energy .
I have to make a newspaper in English as my summer vacation homework and I decided to introduce about my dog on the news paper .
I will introduce about my dog , Tiara .
She is cheerful and plump pretty dog , perhaps she is the cutest dog in the world .
She 's a golden retriever and she 's 8 years old .
Her fur is beautiful amber and soft .
She is little stupid , but has perceptive insights about food because she is always famished ^ ^ She loves food !
When she is basking she looks very comfortable .
however , I hoped rain because it is too hot .
I saw a news on Yahoo yesterday .
It reported that Chien - Ming Wang cut his hair and had a new hair style .
Here is the link .
It talked about there is a big difference about different values of a handsome man between Western countries and Eastern countries .
It mentioned many examples of Japanese men , Korean men and Hong Kong men .
They paid much attemtion to their faces and also spent lots of money to shop .
But in Western countries , the standard of a handsome man depends not on their faces , but on their masculine symbols , say , muscle and behavior .
I started to notice the ways of foreign clothing and hair styles these past days by watching TV programs , such as Friends , Srcubs and etc .
If they had a long hair , it will be really long and thick .
By contrast , men in eastern countries most dress up .
Except a shirt and a jean , we usually wear an accessory .
As to hair , men usually have a median hair , neither very short or long .
If we want to cut a very short hair , we must leave some hair on the back of neck in order to avoid looking like a nerd .
It almost cost a whole morning .
I have to watch the NBA final game 3 .
I like you give me any commets and opinoins too .
I really like to discuss .
My son have diarrhea
When I came back home from working today .
It was like a warter and son 's hip became red .
Tomorrow I will go to hometown .

Spring is very exciting season .

I loved the massage shop where I went because the staff of the shop explains what is wrong in my body .
After that , I went to a fittness club which has bedrock bathing .
I feel relax to take a bedrock bath ^ ^
I 'm went to Sendai to business trip today .
The special product in Sendai is a cow tongue .
I bought it and ate at home .
I want to eat its cow tongue again .
The daughter was woken up by my wife .
The wife was woken up by my stertor .
Where to do it and when we should leave is not decided yet !
So , even now I feel nervous , wondering if It ' really going to be held .
And I want to live my life on my own pace .
Because when I finished my classes , homeworks or jobs etc . . .
It 's nearly 10 pm when I back home .
It 's nearlly 12 pm .
These days I suffered many unhappy things .
Maybe those matters were not so bad as the facts , but I really could 't handle them while they occured together . . . .
I do n't know how to master this language well . . .
Though I spend most of my time and energy in learning English , it seems that I hardly make any improvement has become a truth . . .
I do n't know why I have to learn English so hard . . ! ! !
our teacher said a sentence to me , which made me heart broken . .
I had never knew my English was poor until the teacher told me that my English was sound illogically . . . .
Summer holiday

I went to Kanazawa university festival with my American friend .
I made good friend with Vietnamese .
we enjoyed well .
And we had a dinner with my another friends .
It 's a amazing day today .
It is made of spnge : ) It is cute .
I 've received the acceptance letter and scholarship decision from the Berklee College of Music .
I 'll enter the Berklee in the fall semester this year .
But I have two worries .
One of them is that my English is very clumsy yet .
Another is high - priced tuition .
Anyway , I 'm studying English at the TOEFL Institute these days .
The Berklee do n't requires a TOEFL score .
Many assignments are given to me everyday .
It 's very difficult to do all of them , but I always try to make maximum efforts .
I 'm laerning English , but it 's really difficult for me !
Several days ago , I got an irregular heartbeat for the first time in my life !
It was like this ; I suddenly started to feel a kind of discomfort around my heart .
I was very scary because I had been very healthy so far .
I 'm still in the 20 's .
Do I have to get along with it all my life ? ``
The doctor told me that I did have a irregular pulse ossacionally but it was not a fatal one .
He added that it could get worse due to stress and fatigue , and he just advised me to take an enough rest .
I was releaved to hear the doctor 's diagnosis but I 'm still worried .
I think that may be a common question for those students want to pursue a higher education .
What Chinese universities offer for their students are mostly composed by coursework base curriculum .
I 've sum up some points which I think important and useful .
You can count on google as your best friend , adviser and an almost infinite resources of academic papers .
Many of them you can download pdf copy , or If you ca n't download paper from the links scholar . google . com offer you , go directly to the author 's website , many authors enjoy their paper to be seemed and cited by potential readers .
A good review is the best start point .
And then you can trace the author , or the paper cited to do a more in depth research in your interested area .
The balance of width and depth of your reading is essential .
Both way have its merits and disadvantages .
Inovative and original idea is good , but if you can not find them , you should know that most of research work is just refinement of other 's work .
I 'll spend the next weeks on board of the `` Justo Sierra `` vessel making some geophysical research and learning .
Bad thing , I have n't learned the vessel 's parts in English yet .
The thing that I want to make in January 2009 is to invest more effort in studying English and keep on writing sentences in English every day here , Lang - 8 !
However there were not so many people there , so we do not need to wait our turn outside .
I think that Manga is the great entertainment culture from Japan .
My favorite writers are Naoki Urasawa ( The Monster , 20st century boy and more ) and Hiroya Oku ( Gantz ) .
By the way , I found some web sites that there are huge amount of Mangas that translated in English .
( I think no doubt about illegal . )
It 's a new experience and very educational of English .
But , I think that there are a lot of difficult expressions in Mangas in English .
Diagnosed of being easily impressed
I realized that I 'm that kind of people who are easily impressed .
I 'm moved by very simple things and other people might not even have a second look at .
For instance , I started watching Indian movies about a month ago .
When I had the time , I brought about six Indian movies to watch .
The first movie I watched , made me cry for two hours like a five year old who lost her doll .
Actually all the Indian movies have the same basic idea .
However , I continued crying during the rest five and each one of them impressed me even more .
Indian movies are like clay that you can shape into many different shapes but they 're all still made of clay .
This concept might be a bit ambiguous for those who have n't been in such situation .
I took a medicine , so I feel better for now .
`` 450th times ``
This is my 450th times diary .
I started keeping a diary around the 2008 .
Thanks to the people all over the world , I 'm having a fun time and solid time .
Changing the subject , I got my call from my friend yesterday .
I recently out of shape . `` I was somewhat puzzied for an answer .
Hello ! My name is Ken .
I 'm study of English was started .
However , it is terrible and difficult .
The novel is about a important roman politican called Caius Marius .
He is de main character , although appearing others like Cornelius Silla , Metelus , and the Caesar 's grandfather .
Marius did n't come from a important family , but he became in consul because he was a clever and popular general at roman army .
So , after he was chose consul by the romans , he went to Afrika where he fought againt Yugurta who was king of Numidia .
Marius won the war in two years , and when he went back to Rome he was chose consul again during five years .
Marius had to fright other tribes at north of Italy , until in 100 B .

I love study .

I 've just received a international call by my cellphone .
I was wondering if that was from my friend 's call .
But that 's from Korea 's quarantine depot ,
We do n't have this symptoms now .

Although most people think about what happiness is like , most people never doubt there are happiness somewhere in human 's life .
A famous man , I heard , said in the past that the worst things for you is to be born in the world .
This is my nickname .
I studied applied physics and electronics at a university in Tokyo .
I took a bachelor 's degree of these subjects at the university .
I changed jobs a few times but the same type of job as an engineer .
I still work for an electronics maker in Japan as an engineer .
My parents and a brother and a sister live in Tokyo .
Fukuoka is located the northern part of Kyushu .
Kyushe is a part of the Japanese Archipelago .
Comparing with Tokyo , Fukuoka is compact but it is a very comfortable city .
Commodity prices here are lower than those in Tokyo and Fukuoka Airport is very near central Fukuoka .
You know , Narita Airport is far from central Tokyo .
Moreover Tokyo is a very crowded city .
One thing I unsatisfy to live here is that I 'm separated from my family .
It takes much money to go see my parents from here .
English lesson for Halloween
I 'm an elementary school teacher as you might know .
In Japan , starting next year we 'll officially have to teach English to students who are in both 5th grade and 6th grade .
I 've made some English classes , actually .
The lesson 's topic was Halloween .
We provided some kinds activities to get the students not only to keep enjoying the lesson but also to keep some vocabulary in mind before they know it .
One of them is `` Halloween trivias and Bingo `` .
The student need to answer some questions about Halloween I 've prepared by playing Bingo .
The more correctly they answer , the more Bingo they can get .
After the class , I asked the students to answer a questionnaire .
I was very glad to find they liked the lesson .
One of my ultimate goal as an English teacher is that all students look the world broadly .
I 'm sure you 'll have plenty of opportunities not only to communicate people from other countries but also to know several cultural differences through the lesson .
I believe this will lead them to accepting more things .
That 's why I 'm very excited with teaching studens English ! !
It is cloudy or rainy recently .
Although my school was no lecture , I got up early in the morning today .
It cost six dollars to washing and cost six dollars to the dryer .
When I washing ended , it was evening .
I went to the cake shop in the city my friend introduced to me as nice taste and famous .
The shop of inner decorating was green .
After came back home , I cooked dinner , and the dinner was prawn & avocado salad , roast chicken and OTAMA SAN GOHAN .
First , cut lettuce , cut coarsely a tomato and then stair - fly some prawns .
The OTAMA SAN GOHAN is Japaneseonly traditional food .
It only sprinkles the raw egg and a pinch of the soy source on warm rice .
They were easy cooking but they tasted nice ! !
After that I watched two movie , animation of genius boy and 007 , on TV for approximately four hour .
I appreciate to teach English to my daughter .
I was looking for English class around here .
We thought just taking a trial lesson , but she told me that I want to go to the lesson again .
I am very surprised to her progress .
Now she is very interested in speaking English , writing alphabets and sings WHAT ' S YOUR NAME ?
Her progress owe to you .
It will be base after she will go to new school .
If I did n't need to take care of my kids , I wanted to have your lessons !
It is very easy to come with kids because it is clean , safe , just a 1 - hour time difference and available Haneda airport .
After classes of university , I went back home directly , prepared packages and searched what time I should leave home and which trains I should take .
And if the team win 8 games , the team will get first position .
But remainder of its games is 9 games .
Therefore it is so difficult for it to get first position .
The starting pithier was not good , so that the opposition could get 3 points easily .
We cheered very hard , but the miracle was never happened .
Those are playing sports , reading a book , lithening to music , taking a walk and so on .
My favorit hobby is talking with my friends , because I think it is the best time to be with my friends .
I gained about 10 kilograms after I quitted my clubs in high school .
That 's why I have to lose my weight ! ! !
So , I jog and exercise always .
I wanna have the six - pack ! ! haha

The otehr day I met one of my classmate in high school at a station for the first time in fifteen years .
I 'm English teacher .
She is teacher for walking and posture .
We had small talk ( short talk ? ) there , and left .
When I started to walk , I thought I want to talk with her more !
So I shouted her name and stopped her .
We exchange our contact info and decided to meet again very soon .
We met two weeks ago , I felt strange , because we did n't meet each other for many years , but we have many things to tell each other .
Plenty of things to talk , but not enough time .
We should n't sort people into level , but I believe we are living in same level ( same category , same world ) .
I do n't like watching a close screen so I killed time reading something .
Today , I read `` The catcher in the rye `` as a summer homework .
To say the truth , I could not understand why this book is thought a masterpiece .
Because I did n't feel bored when I was reading it , but I was not so excited or moved .
If you had read the book , please tell me which part you think interesting .

Culture of shames
Foreign medias admire that Japanese people are behaving calmly , organised and in a supporting .
But it 's common for we Japanese .
We think that having trouble others is very bad thing and shameful .
Every parent want their children not to have trouble others .
Japanese have grown rice which need to help each other in the community the past .
I 'd be glad if you correct my mistakes .
Thanks a lol .
I did n't know why I lie but at that time I was blank I = out .
It was a job I seeked from the news paper .

Today I saw a movie - Twilight .

Yesterday , Japan national soccer team played against Australia .
The game was the final of Asia Cup in 2011 .
Five days ago , Japan team played 120 minutes , including extra times , against South Korea , furthermore , the average of height of Australia team is taller than Japan .
So I thought most of the Japan members are tired and the game is very hard for Japan team .
The game was into extra time two times in a row from semi - final game for Japan .
However , at 110 minute , Lee , who came off the bench , got the goal !
I 'm very glad to win Japan team !
Do you like singing songs ?
I like very much .
Today , I went to a karaoke box with my son and naighbors .
I sung so many songs and brewed my stress .
My favorite karaoke songs are Seiko Matsuda 's .
Her songs are easy to sing , familiar with many people and rytmycal .
I had a relaxed time .
Today I might fall asleep soon .
Maybe I got a guitar to my father long ago .
maybe he 's still its owner .
I do n't know but I often use it more than him . . .
Do my best !

I wonder what I give her present , so could you give me some advice ?
Foreigners baby
I can meet foreigners if I go to city in Tokyo but I wo n't be able to meet a foreigners baby .
It 's only adult or childs that I can meet .
I like a baby so I 'm always like to meet a foreigners baby if I have an oppotunity .
He 's living for 10 years in Japan so he likes to talk with Japanese people .
I think our language skill was even .
He wants his baby to speak Japanese so He 's learning Japanese everyday .
Recently , I 'm fascinated with a TV series named `` How I met your mother . `` ( Though I do n't watch it on TV but the Internet because is has n't introduced into Taiwan .
He always make his own theory about life !
Today , since people turn out to be more and more rational and have higher demands about the opposite sex , alone with an open mind about dating which nurtured tons of different reality dating shows .
This show features with `` Parents dating Guys `` .
The process is like this , the girl 's parents will meet the guys first , then they will make the decision for their own daughters who is not even on the scene , by the way , about whether should give this guy a chance to go out for a date with their daughters or not .
Dont understand why so many people are into these stuff , I deceided to arrange some nice dates for my friends by following my own style .
A date which can exude both parties ' warmth and charisma .
Sounds a lit bit tricky ?
Without audiences , love judges , parents , just a friendly and private atmosphere which allows them to be theirselves and enjoy the moment .
Last night was a second date I arranged for my friend and hopefully they can work things out !
play two roles
I 'm a business worker weekday and a student at graduate school 3days in a week .
I enrolled the school in this April .
Hard home work is required sometimes , but it is funny to get new knowledge and thought .
In the business , I challenge a task that I have not ever done .
this is also very valuable for me .
Without fail where there 's great need , great hearts and minds rise up to meet the challenge .
Two mouth later , my professor will take some students to Ohio university in America for a month .
But who wants to go there , he must pass the exam and the interview .
Going abroad is my dream , so I really cherich this opportunity .
It is a good chance to strengthen my knowledge , boarden my horizon , and enjoy the foreign customs , and also realize my dream .
Without any means , what I can do now is to improve my poor English , speaking more , listening more and reading more and so on .
In my opinion , it is a difficult process to overcome myself , but I must insist on and keep on making it , whatever how difficult it is .
Once you make up your mind , so persevere in doing it .
I was suprised when I found it . I have been study English for 2years . Because I want to make a lot of friends all over the world .
Yesterday , Kitajima Kousuke who is a breast stroke swimmer , he got the gold medal .

Wish You Happy In Paradise
I just listened his Boyzone 's brilliant song `` No Matter What `` on the way back home .
Stephen is cute and brave but now he is gone .
When I was in junior high school everything seems boring and no meaning , also I did poorly in study .
One day , I was failed to pass the examination .
At that time I have no place to go , parentes hate a underachieved me but suddenly a fair - sounding floating to my ear ' I ca n't deny what I believe I ca n't be what I 'm not ' I was astonished by the voice and lyrics which cheered me up .
Your lovely face look like a ray of hope .
Wish you happy in paradise
With knowing comes caring , with caring there is an hope that we can find an enduring place within the natural system that supports us .
Oil has been flooding in the gulf of Mexico for three months .
There has been only 15 days without war since human being started recording of history which means uncountable people have been killed and killing at the same time .
On the other side of the world , a great number of people live in less than 1 dollar .
Apparently , the world is lopsided .
All of a sudden , I am wondering how many of us believe we know what 's going on outside , watching lots of news as CNN or New York Times play out .
I 'm building an algorithm of computer program even when I have a dream in the night , because I 'm doing computer program all day long .
It was n't correct algorithm , it 's like a block puzzle .
I 'm piling that blocks up or sorting or something .
For 10 month , I studied Java and Japanese .

Really , I though `` could I do make it ? ``
Sometime , I felt frustrated and despairing .

You can learn a lot of things , like how to use a kind of pen , and meet a lot of people , even they are not always very kind .
It 's too short in break time .
Oh , how wanderful the college life is !
Once you get into the society , your life won ' 't be simiple as that in college .
After each team submits its proposal , there 's a week for the people to vote their faouvorite on the web .
There 's a final prize for the three ones scoring highest at the end of the contest : they all can enrol for free in a postgrade major course ( or a language one , if they have n't finished their career ) .
Additionally , the first team get to travel to New York !

As I had just bought a Motorola Milestone ( the european version of Droid ) , I gave it to my father , who 's actually very happy with it , since it 's a cute small nokia with wifi .
We go firsts now , but since they try to give one prize to a different team each time , we expect the jury to make the ones who go third win this time .

This will result in rapid aging society with fewer children .
I 'm looking forward to see them !
My NY life is getting change .
For example , today I ordered some clothes on the internet shop !
I felt fulfillment !
When I was in Seoul I used to shopping on website .
There are many products that are more cheaper than off - line stores .
After left Seoul , I did n't use the on - line stores .
I could n't believe the method of charging .
Because it was much simple than Korea method .
I just need credit card numbers , that 's all !
I was worried , whether another people catch my numbers .
Finally , I choose the official web site .
Because I could feel more safe and comfortable .
There is no A & F official store in Korea , so private people sell that brand clothes .
And the prices are very expensive ! !
Because of this experiences , I could n't stop shopping on A & F website .
I ordered some clothes and they are going to ship on FEB .
I 'm a little bit disappointed about the speed of shipping , but it does n't matter , I 'm really satisfied with the price and design of clothes .
I expect the arriving would be happen very soon !

Hello ! I 'm sorry to late dialy ; (
Today , I had sleeped only two hours .
So I feel sleeping all day .
Why I still up late , because I watched ladies soccer game ! The game was Japan called `` Nadeshiko Japan `` vs America .
The half game was score less drow , the second half was drow .
Extra game was drow too ! I was very strained by PK ! I 'm afraid of watching PK .
Fighnaly , Japan won the game , so `` Nadeshiko Japan `` is top team in the world ! ! I was exciting , so I ca n't sleep ; ) But I do n't regret watching soccer .
I want to play something sports ! Thank you very much : )
I decided that I will write diary everyday at lang - 8 about dairy thing to learn English .
Today , I took a walk around my house by bicycle .
I visited Freemarket which held at park .
The sounds of the steps
Yes , it is my boss 's one .
I thank my ear for my survival until now .
So many MMA fighters thought I want to be more stronger than I thought .
This is the most necessity thing for them but my opinion is deffrent from them .
Even if they are strong but they sometimes counld n't win .
Because MMA is sports but they should n't think MMA is sports .
There are a fighters who do n't think MMA is not sports and if they seems to lose the fights they are going to try to kill their competitor and so that sometimes the strong lost by the weak .
I want to say is no future in just only the strong .
Fedor who is Russian , I think he is the one of them .
He is called the one of the best fighter in the world .
3 : 25 a . m . at JST

Everyday , I 'm very hard to learn it .
But recently , I wanted to speak English .
If I speak English fluently someday , I want to go abroad .
And I want to see the wonderful architectures of foreign countries .
That 's why , I started it .
I woke up earlier than recently today .
Because I felt headache and heavy stomach .
I thought why I felt bad in the bed .
I had a dinner at 11pm yesterday and slept down as soon .
I did n't feel that before several years , I did same things .
I was disappointed that I was not young already !
We have three days holiday , so I spend these days on playing .
Yesterday I got up late as usual , and then had lunch , went to supermaket with my good friend , and bought something to my family .
Yesterday was a buzy day , but very happy .
I feel the time past faster than usual .

It was very difficult work because we have to fag overtime .
We have many foreigneres as our clients and I really could try my strength in English ) It ` s so interesting to tolk with the Britishes , Germanes , Italianes , Danes , Finnes , Croates . . .

Asashoryu is a Sumo champion .
Sumo is one of the Japanese traditional sports .
He has been accused of puching a man while drunk recently .
Sumo champion , called yokozuna , is required to be strong not only phisically , but also spiritually .

An Backpacker
During the last summer vacation , I traveled around Asia ; Melaka & KL ( Malaysia ) , Siem Reap ( Cambosia ) , and Bagan ( Myammer ) .
I met a Japanese Backpacker When I was in KL .
We became friends soon .
He is experienced backpacker .
He said He traveled around this world .
Especially I like His stories in Thailand and India .
That was really fun .
Kinabalu in Borneo Island .
It says He is in Isreal now .
Then I know Backpacker is always freewheeling .
I have n't understood the system of this well yet , however , I ca n't help posting my first diary .
Actually , everybody in my company counts on me when it comes to English , for example , the customer or the documents from U .
But as you know , my writing ability is like a child play .
I 'm always dreaming to get my English composition proofread by English native speakers .
If you notice something , for example , grammatical error , unnatural expression , please tell me .
This time , I dare to write a diary without using my dictionary .
May it is sunny tommorrow . . .
May it is sunny tommottow . . .
I 'm planning to go climbing the mountain with friends tommorow .
I wish it 'll be sunny . .
It is said from long time ago that you can be healthy and happy or your wis come true if you climb this mauntain .
On the top of mountain , there is a shrine contracted in 700 's .
We , friends since Junigor high scholl , are very interested in this legend .
Water , lunch , and own wish will be packd in our each backpack .
Because it has been raining for 3days , I made `` TERUTERU - BOZU `` wishing sunshine .
It is old custom to make it in Japan although only children do it in these day . .
Usually tit is hung under the roof , but I could ' nt do it .
Everyone who joined this class were very good .
Even midleage man was better than me !
I am beginner .
I made mistakes a lot .
Hysterically , I am a well planned person so there are always full of schedules that keep me from anything spontaneous .
So to speak , there are certain things I have to do almost every day before the sun sets off such as reading a book , watching news , and writing anything .
Ironically , I find it enjoying hanging out with my friend who came here early morning , taking a whole day from me , doing something stupid such as killing flies , making me think what is more important .
I am very stressful ~ now .
It is very difficult to say anything . .
so , I said English with wrong words . .
It was the kingdergardan level ~ ~ . .
When I talk , I forget what I say , ,
Grammer was also wrong . .
I only say that `` I like ~ I want . . ``
very simple things . .
I felt very tired .
It 's very lovely .
It looks like some jewelries .
I thought there were about a hundred thousand people at the grounds .
I had never seen such a many people , so I was very surprised : ) .
By the way , what do you like to do in summer ?
Plese tell me : D
Yesterday , I went to Home Depo to buy a bag of soil and a planter .
I wanted to do repotting of my roses .
The roses grew up and thir flowerpots are too small for them .
And also I wanted to do sowing of sweet basil seeds and oregano seeds .
Oh , I just remember , I also bought a seat of starting pots for that herbs .
It took long time to do that but I was happy , so I like gardening .
a patio , not garden .
I wanted to do sowing of Violas but starting pots was lack , so I would go to Home Depo again tomorrow .
a ) I 'm lacking in the sensitivity to whether an expression is formal or informal .
b ) I have to cultivate ( enhance / enrich / sophisticate ) the sensitivity to others ' feelings .
I do n't like leaning English in school by two years ago .
But , I became like to English because I began thinking by myself .
Lang - 8 is good place for languages leaning , and it give enjoyment to us .
I 'm able keep at it .
Especially , in company , there are many relations .
I want to know how does communicate with each other in foreign countries .
It does n't mean I 'm not going well .
I think I cought a cold : - (
I took a medicine , but I still feel bad .

Their parents send children on their first errand .
It 's a little bit expensive for me , but I 'm so happy to get it .
I carry it anywhere , and show it to my friends .
I decided that I manage it as carefully not to break .
Sometimes , When I get back from college , I feel that I can do absolutely nothing but watching a movie .
I feel so exhausted but I can not sleep because If I slept then when I wake up , I 'll have to start studying again or going to college .
Epidemy of Cool
Here is ending .
The afterquake is still happening in Japan , Kanto area .
But the stuation is being recovering by helping not only Japanese but aloso all over the world .
Unfortunately , we ca n't say there is no problem at Fukushima reactor .
I am going to move out to Saitama ( Kanto area ) from here just because I study at the university in Saitama .
I 'm very worry about the radiation .
We do n't know when the situation recover perfectly .
The worst thing in the world is sitting in a room with only your pen and watch the time go away
Prey for me : D : D
Reading Books in a bath
My precious time is the time when I read books taking a bath !
I usually take a bath more than half an hour .
I think knowing others ' love affair does n't make any sense for me .
I like the stories which can not be expected and be like a roller
I thought earthquake is coming when I wash my face in the morning .
I 'm so nervous at earthquake .

And I have to fix my furnitures to stop slipping .
It is very nice .
We walked around the garden , we saw the animals and differents trees ; we had a smoll lunch
I like making a plan , but I ca n't fulfill my plan .
I think I 'm a lazy person , so I tend to choose an easy way .
I want to do many things for one day .
On the other hand , I think I spend too many hours to use a computer .
It is fun indeed , but it is waste time for me .
If I quite checking sites so many often , I think I can save my time more .
I need to reconsider about how to use a time .
Though I 'm not good at using a time at all , I want to try to be good at using a time .
I must make a good schedule which I never give up on it way to .
I want to have more strong mind to keep my schedule , and I want to control a time , not time control me .

The club has some small stages and I was dancing on it then a guy came to dance with me .
After 5 or 10 minutes dance , at last he noticed I 'm a man .
He was like ' OMG ! ! ' n hold his head .
Anyway I enjoyed a lot ! !
I wasted too much time on watching Youtube .
I watched without any want to watch .
Political ones are always full of childish swearings .

Today is hot and sunlight is strong .
So , I got sunburned a little .
I felt summer will come soon in Japan .
I like winter than summer .
So , I hope that summer will pass fast .
Strange Japanes custom ?
An interesting TV show was aired last Saturday .
One of them is drinking alchole outside , because most countries do n't seem to be allowed to drink .
It is not a smart behavior in Japan either , but we have a lot of fuss once a year outside .
During that season , no one pay much attention even we are drunk , make noise .
The next moment we rather become friends with other groups enjoying over there .
In Japan , strange custom is remained as for hanami .
When we have hanami , we have to get place before starting .
It seems to be their first task .
So , whenver I pass by , I am sure they must be new employees .
Today , my country is rainy .
Very hot , and It was dry .
But , we have to finish term examination .
I can not come to here for around 2 weeks .
If a test is over , I come again .
He has worked at a customer service representative about an insurance .
So he will try to study about something in that his time .
But he has no idea that he should study about .
Japanese economy is so bad now .
We are concerned about when we lose our job .
If he lost his currently job , he would n't know what he should do .
Now , Wii my house .
Recent TV game is amazing .
It is very convenient to codeless .
By the way , dou you know ' Lucky Taxi ' ?
Yesterday , I took a taxi , driver give me a card . ( picture )
It was a little happy day .
Are these sentences OK ? ? : )
Children cry to turn mother 's attention to them .
Today , I was very free .
So , I thought that what to do .
Then , I remembered very important thing .
My room is so messy because I was busy recently .
So , I clened my room very hard .
I was too tired .
T `` is challange time .
It 's easy for me to study it .
I do n't like science too .
I came back to home .
I went to a park ,
So , I enjoyed playing soccer and baseball with my friends .
It ( is able to / may ) rain at any moment .
Please lend me a pen to write ( with / on ) .
I 'm no longer suprised that situation .
All I want to know is that why they could n't come to my calss .
I asked someone about why they were not here .
He explaned the reason in Swahili , so I was n't able to understand , but I realized that they were in under the punishment .
Do you remember my journal which I wrote 2 days ago ?
Today 's calss is the same class which I was n't able to teach them because of CHOTA MAJI .
Tanzanian students are differ from Korean students .
When I was in Korea , if we skipped the calss because of other affairs , they seemed very happy .
However , in here , my students do n't want to skip the calss .
Whenever I have a class at night ( actually , sometimes we have an extra class at night like today ) , I was satisfied of my students who listened devouring every word .
So I have to dug my first MP3 ( 1GB ) out from my drawer .
Well , it can not satisfied me .
And I fall in love with the liberary in our school ! ! !
I always stay there for a long time all day .
By the way , listen to music there is also a good choice ~ ( ha , ha )
Do you take a nap ?
I used to lie down on the sofa after finishing it .
Recently I read a book about the digestion .
Acording to this , taking a nap is not good for digestion .
It recomends us that even if we are sleepy after lunch , we should not sleep ,
and if we get very sleepy , we should go for a walk to forget our sleepness .
Finally I decided to practice it .
After lunch of today , I brought the book to the sofa and began to read it .
But two hours later I found I had been sleeping until that time .
I went to sleep after all today too .
I wonder I will be able to stay up tomorrow .
My sister took entrance exams a few days ago , and she 's waiting her results .
My brother will take it in this Friday .
My sister is university , my brother is high school .
First , I can see some movements of peoples to recover from the damage now .
When the earthquake had happened , the economic activity was depressed strongly .
We thought that it was not good to have a satisfied days when people in the damaged area were suffered .
Although that , we have already realized that the stagnant economy was more bad for the recovery of Tohoku area .
For instance , the usages of the area contaminated by the nuclear energy are now discussed on Japanese newspapers frequently .
I hope Japan will recover from this situation and reply other countries for their helps in the future .
Jpanese energy policy
By the great big earth quake in March 11 , Japanese energy policy has changed drastically .
Many people claim that `` we should not use nuclear power plant ! !
`` It 's true that radiation pollute people or vegetables , soil , air and sea more or less .
However , I do n't think that nuclear power plant should stop immediately .
Because if we ca n't use electricity fully , electricity fee will increase and some corporation decide their factory to move foreign country .
Then , Japanese employment will face great big difficulty .
Most of Japanese people ca n't speak English .
So if we lose our employer , we ca n't have job !
After that , we change our electricity souse to natural one .
We do n't have to change our energy policy if we ca n't do that safely .
This is the thing which often Japanese wives say `` Which is important I ' am or your work ! `` .
It 's same question .
Yet she always answer wrong at the same questions that I had taught several times , like negative number multiply by negative number is positive number .
She just casually answered the questions and sort of appeared impatient , which made me sort of angry .
Yet I has reflected on myself of my behavior back home .
I heard that before but I 've never played it and every one over there neither .
After having a beerpong , many people played with it but a funny thing happened on that day .
Two guys were completing against each other for running in an athletic game .
Both of them does not know how to run in the game exactly .
One of the guy tries to run by lifting up his knees a lot and the others are not .
Actually , it requires lifting up their knees higher enough to make Kinect senser to sense their move , so he was correct and keep the fastest speed in the race .
However , the problem is he is a bit too serious so he started moving toward the TV monitor little by little , then finally he slipped on a floor and fell down .
As the result , suddenly he became 7th in the race which is the second from last .
So , the race turns out really funny one since one guy fell down and the other guy runs his slow pace .
It resulted in getting 7th and 8th .
Everyone started laughing and I was feeling like a documentary of a race with a guy who did n't give up even though he fell down in a middle of the race and a guy who keeps running slowly but never give up .
Be careful during running even though it 's a game .
^ ^ It seems nothing , but very real happiness to me .
At the same time , I want to get how to say no gently because I want to have much happier moment than sleeping in the morning !
I 'm their older sister .
I do n't know what gifts prepared my parents .
In the evening we will nave a little party with barbeque .
And of course there will be some our friends with their kids .
UW means University of Washington , which locates in a beautiful city whose name is Seattle .
Before I went to school this morning , I spent one hour jogging around a big lack which is Green Lake near my neighborhood .
I went to balloon lecyurer as an assistant in `` OMOCHA OUKOKU `` .
A main lecturer was `` DOISAN `` from `` MAGIC POT `` .
But today is rainy day and yet many audience participated balloon lecturer .
Almost all the audience is family .
I difficult to lecyurer for small children .
I Miss You In Loneliness
We live in the world for reasons , some of us live only to live up with their parents and so on .
I am no one of them , but I also miss someone with heart and soul when I feel lonely .
The first one comes to my mind is my grandma .
My mother suicided herself when I was only a baby born one year and since my father worked far far away in the town , I was brought up by Grandma .
As a child , being naughty , I brought about a lot trouble to Grandma , sometimes I even broken her heart .
Every time I go home , she always says that : `` Oh , my son !
You are so thin and more than ever ! `` And then makes good dishes for me .
That 's Grandma , in whose heart , I am always a child .
Then I think of my father .
About 7 years old , I went to a primary school in the town and lived with my father in his school .
Grandma made me a human and Father made me a person .
He always encourages me that I am the best one in the world , if only I can hold on , I can get whatever I want .
In my 16s , I did a lot of bad things , but they never abandon me .
So here I want to tell you how much I love .
There are far less tourists than Saipan or Guam .
There is no shopping mall , no duty free stores but full of natures .
You may feel bored if you like modern cities but I love there .
Actually I have traveled there eleven times !
I think the ocean of Rota is most beautiful in the world .
Local people are very friendly and we can be friends quickly .
Every time I come to Rota , they say me `` welcome back ! `` .
They invite me BBQ , picnic and hunting ! !
This time , they took me to a coconut crab hunting .
It was really exciting experience .
Coconut crab is active at night so we went to a coconut forest at night .
It eats coconut , so it 's flavor of coconut .
It is surely often seen that there is a big difference between ideal and reality .
Sometime , such a time when you will have to accept something hard or bitter might be coming in your life .
Now I 've been in the bottom of my life never experienced before .
I will try to make the gap between my ideal and reality short , but it 's not going well lately even in a small matter .
Who can change yourself is only you .
I am yuu .
I 'm the biginner who just began Lang - 8 .
My heir is not black .
because , It does coloring : )
I will have strengthened muscle for spring vacation
Today 's weather was rain .
I went to the gym which Neyagawa city run so that I can strenghthen muscle .
Maybe , I do n't have much muscle than general men .
So I strengthen muscle .
And then , I went to Lowson which is convenience store so that I can work at there at 5 pm .
Its work was easy today , because today 's wether was rain .
That is to say , when the weather is rain , people are reluctant to go out .
I was upset last night , so I went out for fresh air .
My boyfriend often condemned me to be against him .
So I try not to oppose his suggestion , but I felt it useless .
No matter how much I make an effort , he never changes his mind .
This made me hurt , so I went for a walk for a while but he textmailed me ' You do n't have to come back !

We did n't decide where we should go , but a coach thought me good restaurant .
The restaurant was near my friend 's house .
I asked her if she know there .
She answered `` I do n't know ! `` Therefore we looked for it and we easily found it .
She said `` I knew it !
You and I came here once before !
You brought me to this restaurant ! `` I remembered it .
I am stupid , but my friend too !
And people seems as if they were constipated ( this word is funny because in spanish `` constipado `` is `` cold `` , and it 's eassy mistake the meaning xD ) .
But I 've been happy , and soon I 've seen a teacher that was happy too .
Another new : I 've finished my sculpture !
However , if I do n't get enough sleep , I will feel depressed .
On Sunday , there are no activities and no plans .

My father was once a DJ in club when his youth , he got many LP records and CDs .
So I could come into cantact with many Music from Billboard to Classic .
Actually I was truly blessed one .
Cause You may know or may not know , My father 's generation was absolutely poor .
Everything was completely destroyed including Music .
But there was US Armed Forces in Korea , and they radiobroadcast thier songs meaning Billboard .
My father listened those songs from the radio everyday and recorded it ( Illegal these days . . . ) and dreamed his future .
Even though he could n't eat his fill , but he was happy filling with musics .
He spent all of his money to buy the records or guitar .
Anyways , I got his blood in my vein , I really into the music also .
Both of Emotionally and Physically .
Those records when he bought his youth , now it 's real valuable stuffs : )

What Would You Do When You 're Under Stress ?
These days , I 'm stressed out for my work .
Though I like to behave myself , it 's not easy to take control over my sensitive character .
I think that I 'm easily pissed off regarding tiny things recently .
If I keep going , before long , I might be known for a picky woman amongst colleagues .
Anyway , I listed up my steps to reduce the stress as you can see the below .
Eating sweeties
Playing some music instruments
Having a conversation with friends and family
The simple way is eating sweeties .
But I 'm afraid to get weight .
What a sad if I get a chubby because of the stress .
If I had no sweeties during hard work , I would suffer from stomach ache because the more stress I have , the more gastric acid my stomach secrete .
Still I had no idea which one is more better between gaining weight and aching stomach .
It 's a catch - 22 situation for me .
Speaking of falling asleep , it 's the best for me to reduce the stress .
Nevertheless , it is not feasible to take it due to time - constraints .
: ( Desperately , I need to search for alternatives to cope with the stress .
I 'm happy to hear about it .
I was gotten a old laptop PC from my mother last month because my mother bought a new PC .
So I installed a new OS called `` Ubuntu `` , which is a linux distribution and free , to be fast the running than former one .
The PC using Ubuntu is running well as if it is a new PC !

I am a colleage student .
I live in Chongqing .
Today is a speacil day .
Drug 's name is difficult to pronounce .
Usually , can English native speaker pronounce difficult drug name
For instance , when you saw a article on today 's newspaper about this drug ,
can you pronounce them at a first glance without consulting a dictionary or website , etc . ?
By chance , you can pronounce them correctly only from the alphabet ?
In Japanese case , we can not pronounce some Kanji .
My son has left for Australia last night .
I did n't know whether he worried about or looked forword to , but I hope that it will be special and wonderful experience for him .
I practice for making stories with some words and phrases that I studied today .

I wo n't accept that .

But I never bring on them .
So I am shut of .
But my teacher said `` If you find person with many chocolates , a cellular phone and all that , you must warning to the person .
If you turn a blind eye to , you are tantamount of the person . `` But I was unconvinced .
Because I think that those people do not listen warning .
I am always wearing a pedometer .
Every day , I look forward to record the distance walked .
My wife washed it without knowing the pedometer in the pocket .
Even before , she accidentally washed iPOD in a pocket and iPod did n't work .
My wife said `` You are wrong leaving something in the pocket .
I said `` You are bad to wash without checking nothing in the pocket . ``
I will take English exam at June 12th .
This examination name is `` EIKEN `` .
EIKEN is popular English exam for Japanese people .
I think that EIKEN exam is made by Japanese people for compulsory educational student .
Of cause , usual adults are able to take exam .
However , until EIKEN is somewhat replaced by TOEIC .
Maybe , TOEIC examination is normal English examination all over the world .
I feel difficult TOEIC more than EIKEN .
and then , I will take EIKEN exam .

From the look of it , eco - concious might be the watchword from years to come .
yesterday I and insomnia , mind is all the mess of things !
In order to drink , I finised my work early .
I drank with coworkers days after a long separation .
Because one of the man was on leave of absence from work , we could n't meet with us .
But I was reflect that I could do something for him more .
Maybe if I could listen to his affair he might be not on leave of it .
I went to the climbing gym .
I could climb today more than last time because my hip 's hurt was getting better .
I felt that health is the most important thing for human .
I can have been tired , nevertheless , I went to the climbing gym .
I thought that I 'm happy to go to the climbing gym .
Because I could meet to my friends whose I wanted to meet .
A Japanese famous climber Yuji made many challenges in there .
I tried some new challenges but they were so difficult for me .
After all , I could n't do climbing at level five of challenge .
I could n't speak English too much .
I went to drinking with Nobu afterword .
A thief opened his gyve by a note and killed himself by his shoelace
An official on behalf of the police station said to the medias that he killed himself by his shoelace after opening his gyve by a note in hand .
I 'm glad to see the official became so imaginative .
I 'm not irritable so much but I gained 6kg since then and sometimes I wanna eat foods that I do n't take before .
It 's a little scared .
So I 'll try to find things I like more and I have to go on a diet !
It seems to have been very hard day today for me all day long .
It was just because I was very gloomy unconsciously .
I do n't know ell the reason why I was very annyoing about everything .
Was it just because I have lots of lessons .
I got out of temper to my friends as much as I felt forry for her .
She shows me deep understanding , because we are vest friend .

I have decided to start a writing for Teacher 's exam in the winter of next
I 've heard that The United States introduced a system that rating teacher ' s
what the most interesting I thought is that this system assesses teachers with students score .
I do n't think students score could be the standard for estabilishment .
For example , varities of teaching methods and materials should be involved in criterion for estimation .
A fern begins to grow on the structure named prothallus , which is green and whose shape is similar to heart mark , and a fern will bring up through a lot of complex events .

I 've been learning English for about 9 years with 4 years of brake , but I 've never had contact with people who speak English , so I think that in my future posts you will find lots of polish influence .
My idea for a life , I think , is make all dreams come true doing everything what I can at the moment .
I hate living in one place and doing thesame everyday .
My favourite subjects are maths and phisic , so probably I can have problem with connect they with traveling or something like that .
But last time I heard about charity organizations which need ingeeners and it can be a nice idea .

I think this film is one of the best films of Clint Eastwood .
There was a kind of lecture about his music career .
He played the contrabass and the guiter .
His music is played in the end of Gran Trino .
I am at my first year of university and I 'm currently studying English and Japanese as main subjects .
I 've always loved learning new languages , and these are the ones that I definitely like the most .
I really enjoy learning new words ad expressions , and when I do n't know the right way to say something or the right word for something you 'll literally see me running towards the dictionary and grabbing it as soon as I can !
As far as Japanese is concerned , It 's always attracted me in a way and so , since my town has one of the best language insitutes in Italy ( can you say that about a university ? I do n't know . . ) I 've decided to study this charming language .
Since the summer vacantion start , I always stay up to play computer game and even get up until AM13 : 00 .

( In particular , on the plane for Australia flight crews kindly served me with meals five times )
After I came back to Japan , my weight increased by more three kg before I left for .
And I have n't change troublesome part of my body yet .
It emphasized it 's important that the calorie you consume must be high or equivalent against that you take in .
That 's why I decided to eat low - calorie foods and to go jogging everyday .
Then there 're good thing and bad thing .
The latter is that going outside in winter is reluctant behavior as much as possible !
Using Lang8 may be a way to make a friend .

I was a bit sleepy at school , so I decided not to do the same things again .
Almost all japanese business man use train .
Some of them see mobile pages , and read some books , the other sleep in the train .
Sometimes they who are seated on chair lean against me .
It 's weighty .
I think they are very tired at their office , because of their a lot of hard work .
So they want to sleep more long time as possible as they can .
Today people next to me is so .

Plant a young trees
Yesterday father and I planted a young trees .
They are five kind of trees which are about one or two - year old .
They 're maples , vines , and some korean native kind of trees .
Before we go to our garden to plant , we went to a restaurant for lunch .
Then we met my eldest sister couple by chance in the restaurant .
My broter - in - low who 's name is Mr .
park , joined .
And we plantde trees and clean the garden .
It taked about two hours to finish .
Yesterday , a friend of mine recommended me this website .
To a new comer like me , it is a really very interesting and useful website .
I find what most appeals to me is that one can improve his or her ability in a foreign language while make new friends from all over the world .
Disney cartoon was very funny and made us amazing .

I went a hot spring today .
It occurred to me that Japanese does n't hesitate to take a bath with others is but shy to talk with foreigners .
I think that 's why Japanese is shy .
How do you think about this ?
An annual meeting of society for neuroscience will be held from the next Saturday to Wednesday at Chicago .

And sometime people says `` U .
So , I 'm really anxious about this travel .
Today I bought a book written by Morimi Tomihiko at the bookstore in my college , where all the college students and teachers can buy books at a five persent discount off the regular price .
Most of the Japanese colleges have such bookstores . ) The title of the book was ' Kitsune No Hanashi . ' ( ' Kitsune No Hanashi ' means ' A story about a fox . ' ) I found that the story was very mysterious .
I do n't think Morimi Tomihiko is common all over the world , so let me explain who he is .
Now he lives in Kyoto and the settings of most of his novels are Kyoto .
Though many of the main characters in his novels are dull college students , his literary style is very colorful and sophisticated !
In Japan , his books are very popular among young people , especially among college students .
Whenever I read his books , I am fascinated with his wonderful literary style .
Futhermore , his story is very enjoyable .
Anyway , I am fond of the books written by Morimi Tomihiko .
But I 'm afraid his books are very difficult to translate into another language .
I 'm going to finis reading ' Kitsune No Hanashi ' today .
, After that , I have to concentrate on the preparation for the STEP test on the next Sunday !
Because I want draw CHARTS in excel by python , I 'm reading microsoft excel binaries .

The byte stream is sequences of BIFF Records .

Tomorrow , I have a work as a hall stuff member but I have a holiday day after tommorrow , so I can stand it .
The US president Bush will finish his term soon .
In my opinion , I 've always thought he is really incapable and dull .
( Again , it 's just my personal opinion . ) In spite of incapable people , they can be a politician .
There are a lot of such politicians in Japan , too .
Probably , they also could be a head of state , if they had something advantage , such as crowd - pulling charisma .
So I 'm wondering what is Bush 's advantage .
I still ca n't find it .
According to the news , the shoes were not the reporter 's own ones .
He prepared big and heavy shoes for this attack .
If it had hit Bush , he must have gotten injured .
Then , finally I found Bush 's advantage .
What a good reflexes he has .
He has cat - like - reflexes .
I wonder if he was playing any sports when he was young .
If Japanese politicians were him , they would get hit and injured terribly .
I do n't think he could be the US president due to his good reflex though .
I think you watch it a lot of times , but look at his incredible reflexes again !
Especially , the first throwing !
Next month , I will go to a collage .
I become foolish .
I have been belong to tennis club .

I was at a loss for a while , but I bought shoes - keeper involved in deodorizers .
Nanotechnology is one of the most promising area for science and technology field .
Because of its particle size , which is less than 100 nm , nanparticle has mechanically , physically , chemically , and electronically different properties than that of bulk materials .
Engineered nanoparticle is applied for drug delivery , solar cells , clean manufacturing process , cosmetics , and so forth .
Venture capitals , governments , and industries has invested tremendous money for spurring the innovation of nanotechnology .
While the bright side of emerging nanotechnology has been extensively covered by media , the safety of nanoparticle has attracted small attention .
Because of its size , nanoparticle could intrude our lung when we are exposedto it .
Once nanoparticle is in the environment as products or byproduct from factories , it is practically impossible to detect because of the particle size as well .
English pronounceation
I have worked for an American company for 4years .
All of my colleague are bilinguals .
Ofcource each English levels are different but my company requires at least 730 toeic point .
Therefore , our employees English level is higher than other Japanese companies .
Other countries , for exapmle Germany , most of business people can speak English rather than Japanese .
Hence , 730 toeic points are common for them .
But the accent of English is not associated with Toeic score .
Even if people who have 900 toeic score , their pronunciation is not good .
I found this fact when I jumped in this company .
A woman colleague can write English e - mail very well but her speaking has very strong Japanese accent .
It 's difficult for us to improve the pronunciation only by reading or writing foreign language .
For American , Japanese `` Futon `` is a misterious sound because shape of mouse for `` Fu `` is different between American and Japanese .
I 'm not english very well , but I really want fluent english skill .
I want talk about many story but it 's difficult . . . .
English class is best of best hardship .
I ca n't understand that my english professsor 's lecture . . . .
I do not understand the use of prepositions such as in , on , at , and of .

It is very shiny sunny and dizzily hot today .
Please take care not to get dehydrated or not to suffer heat stroke .
You had better not to exposed the sun shine and heat for very long time .
Enough water and electrolytes help you from heat attack .
Take good care and enjoy summer as well as possible .
I like five - finger socks and wear it almost everyday .
It 's quite comfortable because my feet do n't get sweaty .
One day , a friend of mine found me wearing five - finger socks and said to me , `` I know it 's comfortable and I like it too , but ca n't wear it .
When my mom was wearing five - finger socks , dad said that it was enough to turn off even a love that lasted a 100 years ( a Japanese proverb ) .
Mmm , it may look a little goofy , but I do n't think it that bad .
How do you feel if your girlfriend or boyfriend wear it ?
You should try wearing it if you have never worn .
Something fun !
My friend Philipp and I went to office this morning by bus .
He had to call one guy who would hand a key over to him .
The one was entrusted by Philipp 's German friend .
At beginning , `` # $ % ! @ # % ! @ # $ `` Philipp said in German . but the one opposite ends of the phone line did n't reply .
So Philipp said , `` Do you speak German or English ? `` And then , they chat with English .
After two or three sentences , ' Do you speak Chinese ?
And he turned to speak Chinese .

In my country , we do not need to vow when we get married .
Brides and grooms simply go to city offices and turn into the marrige application form , which has the brides ' , the grooms ' , and two wittnesses ' sigunitures .
No picture IDs are requiered to turn into the marrige applicatin form .
Even the law does not require the couple to come to the city office .
Somebody else can go there insterd of the couple .
Becouse of the system , sometimes problems are arisen .
When a couple go to the city office to turen in their marrage form , they sometimes find out that one of them ( or both of them ) is alredy married to someone else .
No one person has received more praise and abuse than Steven Jobs , who is the CEO of APPLE & PIXAR corporation , as well as has being cover person over 200 famous magazines .
I was astonished by Jobs 's lecture spoken in Stanford University in 2005 , which including three stories , and tell us should follow our heart to find our goals .
He did n't know what 's the meaning of continuing his study in a college which fees is so expensive that cost most parts of his parents ' money .
Instead of this , Jobs started to drop in the calligraphy class in his college , which supplied the one of best calligraphy training in the whole country .
At that times , he just interested in this class but have not awared of the importance .
Until did he creat the first APPLE computer , all the effects what he had done before came back .
Only did you trust something what followed your heart as well as work hard , one day when you looking back , you can clearly know the secrets of these dots you have done .
He was expeled on the grant scale from APPLE , which company was created himself .
Nevertheless , he said that he has been reject , but he still love .
Dramatically , these striking things let him found his dreamboat , established a new company : NEXT , purchased PLXAR and became the CEO of APPLE again .
So do n't settled , keep looking your love .
now I 'm finally writing my journal . . . . !
Actually , these days are kind of hectic and I could n't spare time for doing that .
But it is a fact that I had n't been writing journals .
Even though I skipped it for only 1 day .
let me explain it !
First , when I wanted to write it , something was wrong with my PC !
To make matters worse , there were no time left for me .
As those who have read my journals know , I started working part time ( the contents is that giving out leaflets outside ) and I was kind of busy .
In fact , I did it too today .
I said that I earn enough money on my own to study abroad at the Australia , but this job is a little hard .
LOL In addition , when I do it , I am avoided by people in most case . . . .
I went back home from USA yesterday .
I realized many differences between Japan the US during my 3 weeks stay in the East Coast .
Secondly , streets in the US are designed in grid style , and each streets have theirs own names .
For instance , the names of the streets are numbers ( like `` E 32 Street `` , `` 5th avenue `` ) in New York .
I hope will meet some native speakers and someone
who have many ideas to express for my sentenses .
Of course , I also will join to help Who are learning Japanese .
I read the article about Starbuck Instant coffee in the Asahi
I suppose most of American people know it well , as it 's been being sold since a year ago .
My American friend has kept sending it to me , I 've been enjoying it every day .
If you are a Starbucks fan , it would be worth to try it .
Sakyo says `` I could n't except a book evolutions like this although I am a sci - fi writer `` .
I have a certain obsession about the train .
It was off at 5 : 30am beneath the moonlight to take the train left at 6 : 00AM
What I had done on train was to gossip something happened in the class with my pals
whenever I heard the sound came from train station
It was very cold day today , even though June is coming tomorrow .
I think that it is kind of hot and very humid season in June , a Japan 's rainy season .
So I hope there will be no high humidity .
I have only lived in Japan , but I hate Japanese very very very humid climate in summer !
Lack Motivation
But , I was at home all day without doing anything particularly .
It 's really waste of time .
I think I 'd rather go out than stay at home uselessly .
But , I do n't feel like going out as well when I do n't feel like doing it though I have what to do like a report .
I always regret it after finishing the day .
It is very bad morning .
Never go the streets of St .
Petersburg to - 20 degrees .
Hot coffe , sigarettes and warm blanket - this mine today 's need .
I 'm knitting a crochet case for handy phone .
I would like to present for my grandmother and my former students .
If I have many time , I crochet a cap for my husband : - )
When I entered the senior high school and joined the mountaineering club in 1996 , I bought a head light by Panasonic .
Today 's first login - day .
I 'm system consultant .

I sometimes come to ECC , ECC is English conversation school .
My company paid 80 % fee for me .

Do you know a hot - water bottle ?
It 's a bottle made of plastic or other things ( I do n't know exactly . ) in which you pour hot water .
You put it in your bed on the cold night , so you can warm your feet and sleep very well .
It 's a wonderful article .
Unfortunately , the other day , I 've got a small hole in the one that I 've used for several years .
So I went to go shopping to buy another one .
Fortunately , I found something better .
It 's a kind of a hot - water bottle , but there are cerry seeds in the bag .
You put it in the micro - wave for 3min , and ready to be used !
It was a little bit more expensive , but it will be soon my birthday .
So I bought two , one for my feet and the other for my nec and shoulder .
I 'm not interested in Buddhism , but yesterday I studied a little .
I came to think that Buddhism might have profound teachings .
Buddha means a person who is spiritually awakened .
However , even if we could solve the trouble , unless we would solve the root of the troubles , we would be in another trouble like that repeatedly .
Buddha had known the root of trouble which are common in mankind .
When Buddha would have helped people in trouble , he had thought not only the trouble in front of them , but also the whole trouble should have been solved .
The value of currency alway change .
Even I have done the deal for three years , I still confuse the moving of the Market sometimes .
My trade rely on the two basic forms of analysis : fundamental analysis and the technical analysis .
Fundamental analysis is based on which the price will reflect the big news .
Thechnical analysis use the charts as the objects .
Look my trade the recently :
China support Portugal and buy the national bonds .
How do you think my deal method ?
I think everyman have to believe something
Human is so weak so always want to believe something .
In korea foreign missionaries have been succseefully brainwashed people .
I living in a small city where total population is almost 200000 .
but In my city hundreds churchs are here .
every holiday people come into my house tell me about god and if I do n't believe in god I will go to the hell .
our country used to believed in budha but since advanced countries opened our market by force 70 % of people are catholics and protestants even old mans starting to go to a church .
It 's good to go to a church but do n't pushing others to believe it .
he might do n't throw away atheists to the hell .
just one reason I did n't belive him .
hello !

Something to drink in white color
I ordered a glass of white drink when I had a dinner at a restaurant yesterday .
I did n't know what it was at the bigining of drinking .
Can you guess what it is in the glass in the picture ?
Actually it was yogurt liqueur .
I go to the training gym and running about three times in a week .
Then I often listen to rock music , but I want more songs that is speedy and rhythmical .
I hear that music of BPM 160 - 180 is suitable for running .
I 'm always looking for the songs .
If you have any songs you recommend , please tell me .
He did not look well .
So , I went to take a walk with my daughter and my son for 2 hours .
Through we have three day 's holiday running , it is a real disappointment .
I know this SNS , using learning forign language , `` iKnow `` ( http ; / / www . iknow . co . jp ) .
Sometimes I go abroad , such as Taiwan and another asian country .
English is communication tool and the most popular in the world .
I think communication tool give us some chances .
If possible , I work with foreign people using my english .
The flowers keep flowering and rising up towards the Sun .
Friend is holding a knife or a gun .
All around you does n't mean a thing .
I got the melancholic time which gives me a reflect of life that has already passed me by .
It hit me and it even made me making rhymes .
But sometimes I think that good life is n't booked for each one who wants it .
I wish that God held your hand in the time full of doubts . .
The moment that lasts can be the best moment of all you had .
You still have new friends , the old ones are covered by a dust .
`` English cafe `` was opened every first Sunday once a month and many students , teachers and Christians gather the party .
It was different the usually lesson , the students and the teachers were relax and fun .
I made many Christians friends there .
I 'm not Christian but I was happy to making friends .
If I was woman ~
I 'll think of a bit about if I was woman .
The reason I 'll think of it is just enjoyable for me .
If I was woman , the figure would be more lovely than sexy .
She would have long hair hanging down the chest , and the hair color must be black .
The personality would be rather calm than tomboyish .
Maybe she would n't be so active , so she would n't belong to any club .
She would n't be doing so poorly at school , but she would hate studying .
Her type would be a man who is a little brawny and has a tender heart .
Dood dinner at omiya
Fortunately we can use electric power all day long today , which made as spend a day as usual .
Yesterday I went to Tsutaya ( it is the biggest rental DVD and CD shop in Japan .
However , we can buy new DVDs and CDs there . ) with my family because my husband wanted to borrow some DVDs from the shop .
And then , I discovered many imported CDs are selling for 80 percent off .
I 'm very happy because I could bought each CD for only 300 yen ! ! !
It 's very cheap ! ! !
Today is the last days of golden week .
During golden week , I could n't learn English anymore .
Therefore , from tomorrow , I would love to learn English again .
I know I should wear them but they make me look like an idiot .
People tell me to where contact lens but I think it makes my eyes unhealthy absorbing tears in my eyes .
Truthfully , I have lost more than five pairs of lens so it is never worth it .
I think my bad eyesight is due to that I like watching , reading , and writing .
All of my good friends moved to a distant place for reasons .
I 'm very concerned with it .
I have heard of that mongolian people 's eyesight is very good due to the no buildings and no monitors environment .
They always see a distant not like us .
Anyway , someday , I want to get lasic if it can improve my eyesight causing no side effects .
All of we should remember to wear more clothes ^ .
The day before yesterday , it is a special date to our youthes .
It is so called Youth Day which celebrates the youthes ' contribution to our country .
We are just the flowers growing up healthily and will serve the country after grown up .
I feel fortunate that I can live in such a country with speedly developing economy and superior military power .
As a university student in the present age , I have a heavy burden on my shoulder , so I know that I should have the will to build our country stronger and take every action to gain a good knowledge of science .
We grilled beef , corns and sausages .
I enjoyed some beer !
A singel house
There are several different types of houses in American .
So far , I 've visited town houses , condos , apartments , except single houses .
I heard about a single houses is very pricey .
Absolutely , you have your own garden without sharing it with others .
Last week , I spent two days to stay over at my father 's friends ' place .
It is really a luxury house .
The gardening of the front yard is very nice .
The anti maintain it in a very neat and organized condition .
Not only the front yard is good but also the back yard is too .
They built a outdoor fireplace and a BBQ stove .
It is two - floor - high and there is a spiral staircase there .
Every room has its own bathroom and each of it has 2 sink for hand washing .
The most special room is that there is a indoor window of it .
You can stand in the room and see the whole panorama of first - floor living room .
The Staff Valued Home Event Than The Work
I wrote about a test of the radiation contamination for foods before .
The radiation specialized staffs have been performing this inspection .
However , our staffs were asked for the help because of the shortage of the test member .
Today the staff who was decided as a helper wanted the change of the date .
The reason is because he wants to participate in the athletic meet of the child .
Because we decided the date after having heard the staff 's convenience , this is not almost possible .
I was surprised that there was the staff who valued home event than the work .
I 've finally gotten why they won the world cup .
Of course , my goal is to be as good an English speaker as a native English speaker .
but I must get the good score with the TOEIC so that I do my best to English now .
While I get into the studying English , my lab has begun the project that lab students have make a glider robot .
There is harder and harder working the project .
We had felt difficulty that we make the glider robot .
That ` s why we took a lot extra time .
I want to use time the English study more than I do that .
I ` m reconsidering to adjustment my schedule .
I have never forget to make good both things .
The life after maternity leave
This is the first time for me to write diray in English .
I 'm really happy if someone kindly read and check my English .
Last weekend , my husband was not at home , so I invited my friends in company on both saturday and sunday .
They said they were busy , and they had to get many days off because their children often got sick .
In her case , her mother lives near her , so she can get her mother 's help , and she does ' nt need to get off work .
I felt down when I imagined the life after I started working again .
I teach Italian and English ( funny but true ) in an Association where street boys and girls with difficult backgrounds are helped with their homeworks .
One of the guy performed in the show so he invited me and other teacher to support him .
What changes happend ?
I want to write the one of the biggest changes tonight .
It is natural , but I have had life with my parents for 27 years .
I was depended on my parents , and influences from my parents was large .
I believe my action was limited within my parents allowed .
So now I 'm feeling so free as if I were a bird leaving a nest .
Fortunately my hasband do n't interfere me .
Now after marriage , six months passed .
And then I started two things , because I felt I can do anything .
I want to write about new things next time .
DIARY , my bro will enlist into korea military .
My bro will enlist into military .
Korea is divided into South korea and North korea .
thesedays international news are not good for everyone who live in korea .
( you know the YeonPyeongDo 's news ) So , my family and my relations are worried about him .
But , he just said that every man in korea should go to the military , except the disable .
So , do n't worry about me .
He joked `` Please buy meat for visiting , esp chichen , dakgalbi . . . ``
I looking forward to recomeback to home . . .

Today was very busy day .
I went to Gangnam station to study English in Pagoda academy .
I met my friend who serviced in marine band .
We talked about the old days during about three hours .
I went to computer academy after meeting .
The lecture of today was so difficult , however , I did my best to make good program .
Most of the people are older than me .
Especially , an old man who sit in the next of my desk is the oldest people in our class .
I thought he will be very hard to learn to make program .
I am right .
so , I always help him making program .
My name is Mari Carmen and I 'm a spaniard new user of Lang - 8 .
I hope to improve my english here and I want to learn french too .
Next year , I want to study a Master of Design in a British or French University .
I hope to help with spanish language to somebody who need it .
I totally agreed with his opinion .
How long they work a day is kind of controlled by the urgent demands from their various stakeholders , so they do n't have any discretionary zone .
The words spoken out of mouth is strengthless , and eye contacts are full of confusion .
It reminds me of the Bable story , God seperates people with different languages , and people are never united as one any more because of the languages , then the world is full of suspiciousness and frustration .
Keeping going !
Today is so tired : P
everything make me crazy
I do n't know what happen maybe just feel confused .
By the way , Typhoon is coming soon and maybe a lots of studeants think , whoa I can rest a day and hope typhoon stay in Taiwan .

And after a few years , they changed menu to pork cutlet .
All of my friends envyed me .
And now they run grilled meet restaurante .
When I had my fortune told on internet , I was died in early age because of hunger in my previous life .
I would like to wirte a letter to my English teacher , so I want you to correct my English .

Thank you for everything what you did for me .
I do like your explanation !
I really admire your sophisticated teaching skills .

I give you a red ballpoint pen .
I will be really happy if you could correct my English someday in this pen .

I do n't go because my ex - husband will come .
`` Do n't leave children , I ca n't take care of them ! ``
He do n't like that I leave children at church .
But children like to play at church , and mabe , their feel happy to meet their farther I thought .
I 'm so full of sadness . . .
I want to be a kindergarten teacher because I like a small child is .

How to get driving license successfully ?
This weekend , I will go to training ground to learn driving with trainer .
Though I understand some knowledge , I never drive a car .
There is some stress for this training .
What noise it is outside !
It 's too loud to fall asleep , it 's about 4 : 30 am here in Japan though .
Nevertheless , my wife seems able to keep sleeping even under
I wonder if we even here are safe .
that the sparks set fire to its surrounding houses and spread the fire .
Who did it ?
are them identical ?
I even did n't realize what happened until the week passed .
And it seemed that I forgot a lot of things , like finding a part time job , making a call to my mom .
I quite did n't know what I was busy with , it just passed .
First , during the weekday , I got a little busy , and things about my work seemed got better , because my colleagues treated much better last week , and they seemed more believe in me now , except one , who have never say anything nice to me .
Like me , I am not very patient and sensitive about numbers , but now , my work is close related to numbers , It makes me learn to be much more patient and careful .
And I have learned another important skill , that is to write down everything that you do n't know , or you can not remember clearly , especially which are very improtant to your job .
I know that I should be confident , and should be more sensitive , so that my colleges will believe me more .
It seemed like I did n't prepare it well , but it also passed quickly .
In fact , this is my second time to meet a E - friend , but these two time all turned out well .
Like me , before I went to see my E - friends , I was quite scared , and I was pray for a good luck .
But donot over react to it , because there are also a lot of nice people in the world !
Many big waves are coming to the sea by the influence that Tyhoon is approaching now .
It 's good day for surferes .
I 'm going to do bodyboard today afternoon .
Last Friday , I passed final driving test at my driving school ! ! ! ! !
After the test , I said my appriciation to a instructor who cheered me up when I failed the driving test once .

Thank you for all instructors in the school ! ! ! !

I 've never taken diary in my life , but I 'm sure I can keep updating my boring days for English training .
This is the first time to write something after I arrived at the US .
When I was in Japan , I had thought that I can be a great English speaker if I live in the US .
But , it is completely wrong .
Japanese siege feeling
Today , Japan is fulled by siege mentality .
Many young Japanese do n't have activeness to working and is uncertainty for their future .
I ca n't see my future clearly too .
I think Japanese have high ability , so we can more contribute to world .
Ooh ~ I 'm earning lots of money .
It 's a sedentary job and I think it 's my cup of tea : )
You know , because I suck at dealing with customers , or work that requires a fair amount of communication with the other workers !

And I entered a company which is I work now .
Then I 've worked in next company about 2 years .

I said again and again to my mother that I would like to go somewhere and give me some money to do it .
She did not give it ; I do not have passport now .
Do you have any place to recommend for me ? ( anywhere OK )
I went to the Koshien stadium to watch a baseball game , last Friday .
Hanshin Tigers versus Yokohama Baystars was held .
We rode a bus and a train to there , and the train was crowded by the people who went to the Koshien stadium .

We enjoyed very much , and came home at late night , then youngest son was already sleep .

My birthday was in three days ago !
That day should be a happy day , but it is n't !
My family have a row .
I feeling sed and sister get out of the house !
I will back to school soonly , my school in another province !
My next time back home will in many month later , I realy wan n't to back school in a broken - hearted , but I can do nothing !
Well , it 's very tough to figure out what to write in because my days is always the same routine .
As always , there is nothing special to happen today .
Well , I have 94 days left until the return to the college .
Anyway , I have a plan to go to CheongJu and look for suited room near my college with my friend MinSung on Nov .
Well , I hope that the room would be very silent and calm , not noisy .
In addition to that , I want it would fit my position .
I mean it 'll be great if it wo n't cost me much money , because I do n't really want to burden my parents with the rental prices .
Speaking of which , I and Minsung might be suppoesed to live together at that place .
We 've been through this , and he think it 's going to happen , but I do n't decide yet .
I 've now and then seen some people live together and always put up a fight each other about mean and small stuff and end up hating each other .
What if I and he would be that case ?
But , there 's a merit .
Actually we would only use English everytime we 're at our place to improve our English speaking dramtically .
This was Minsung 's idea .
Well , this sounded like very lovely idea to me when he propose that , because I 've thought about that either .
Actually I 'm thing about that .
Well , I do n't know what is a good decision .

To teach children is very difficult for me .
Because they 're so powerful that I ca n't sometimes control them .
But also I often get a power from them .
I think I must be more tough and study harder to see their smile .

My Original Accent
I was born in north - east Japan .
Those who were born there have an original accent .
Although there are many accents in Japan , the accent of our area used to be said that it was corny a long time ago .
I had been made fun of it in front of my friends when I was a child .
I was so humiliated our accent during my chilfood that I tried to modify it .
That 's why I can speak common accent too .
I took a class to study Japanese language structure to be a volunteer today .
Our teacher told us we should not be ashamed of our own accents because each accents were created by their cultures .
She let me speak aloud my accent in front of other students .
I wonder if many people all over the world are proud of their original languages .
I 'm very proud of my accent now !
Because it was gifted by my ancester .
Today I had a GABA 's lesson with a new teacher who was from England .
First I asked him some basic questions , like `` where are you from ? `` , `` what is your favorite Japanese food ? `` , `` What is your hobby ? `` One of his hobbies was cooking then we talked about cooking and foods .
I was very surprised that England people liked very hot curry .
Instead I talked about my favorite Indian restaurant in Ikebukuro .

Today 's diary
Today I was going to English school
But I had been worked all night
So take a transfer class on this Friday
Sorry my teacher
Now I can give my opinion and receive advices from others instead of just letting my friends help me .
What a job !
What more exciting was I received 9 corrects .
I also corrected a couple of entries , however , the states of my profile just showed 1 corrections made .
After the interview , I would help more to give back .
I 'm in Tokyo , which is the capital of Japan , right now .
I attended the seminar on the way of thinking to make sentences in English .
Many Japanese tend to translate literally what they want to say .
For example , if I want to say that he is stubborn , I can say he never changes his opinion .
I learnt I need to have more various point of view through this seminar .
After the seminar , some participants including the teacher and I went for a drink at a bar .
We talked a lot and had a blast , and it was fun that one of the participants talked his experiences when he 'd been in Germay .
Incidentally , I write this entry with my iPhone ! !
I usually use a car on commuting , but I will use a motor cycle to save money .
However it is very very slow for its oparation .
She ca n't still swim very well yet , so she wanted to use her inner tube all the time .
But she improved a little for one hour .

Of course , it is in Japan , but I saw some words written in English , `` TICKET MACHINES `` , `` EXIT `` and `` COUPONTICKET `` .

He seems to addict with facts and informations .
While he think more further about mysterios and his interest .
He will go to gather the knowledge .
Life will be devide to each part that let him feel safe to separate people to each groups .
Even he does n't like exactly time frame activities , discipline .

He is good at creativity and make a good decision .
but I 've just happened to discover this Lang - 8 and I 've started .
On last Sunday I took an English ability test .
There were some different kind questions to check writing skill ; writing your opinion freely , summarizing the reading passage or summarizing the listening dialogue .

It 's a girl and a boy who a little bit older than me .
My English is terrible , so enought .
I 'm surprised that I suddenly accepted messages on a Japanese SNS from my junior high school friends who I had not seen for more than twenty years .
He sent me an email .
I sent an email to them .
No one did not remember me clearly .
There will be an alumni association of the track & field club in the next summer .

I also wanted to study at there .
And I was into there , ordering some foods .
But , one stuff told me that do n't study here because we are busy .
I got off there because of uncomfortable .
I can study rather than at home to the cafe .
This morning I have to sit with my little cousin , Dima .
He is so annoying ! Do n't think I am so evil , I do love children .
But he makes me feel angry .
Although he is already 3 years old , he cries like a new - born baby , while his mum is out ! Not only cries , but even shouts .

I usual run to work , but take trains to work on rainy days .
We had two - days rain , so I took trains .
Since I have to take two trains to work and there are some time loss , it takes more time to go to work by train than on foot .
On the other hand , the advance is that I can read books in the train .
Last weekend , I quarreled with older brother .
Really really I hate my brother .
I could n't catch most words . . . .
I 'm not familiar with British sounds , but I was shocked . .
Runnnig
I run near my house twice a week for the health .
I usually run about 6 km .
I sometimes run up to 10 km .
It takes for about 40 minutes to run about 6km .
My pace is usually 6 minutes per 1 km .
I run for the halth , so I never overdo .
If I feel something bad , I do n't run longer than usual .
But I run at least about 3km when I feel someting bad .
If I feel good , I sometimes run much longer than usual .
Maybe I run about 10 km slowly when I feel good .
I found incorrect history in my debit card .
I shopped in the supermarket on a snowy day .

I take as many classes as possible , because I have a voracious appitate for studying !
But , sometimes my fatigue beats my motivation > < Since I have been pressed for time because of heaps of assignments , I have slept 5 hours on average recently .
In Japan , some students often sleep during a class at an university .
self - introduction

I want to make a lot of friends , so please contact me .
Japanese likes `` Manga `` .
Recently , I think that Japanese likes a game too .
There are adults who play game in the train .
The other day , I saw a women who play game walking a busy street !
I like playing a game too .
But we must choose places to play a game .
I wonder What do foreigners think about this .
Since both my language exchanging partners , Zac and Mark are busy for school , I sometimes talk to them though , I think it is n't enough for me to speak English .
I 'm very tired . .
Well , , I 'm a girl sixteen years old .
So , I ca n't use English very well . .
such me , nice to meet you !
Today , I went to high school .
So , I want my teacher to be interesting .
He was taking holiday from 18th December to 18th January .
So we had a lesson another teacher who is Ethiopian duerng his holiday .
We have a lesson from Ethiopian more than English teacher lately .
He question one by one , we try to answer but some student can not answer
When another student helps to the one , he said at once `` I asked her , not you . ! ``
It ended unplasant atmosphere .
After that we feared all this time .
But , I 'm looking forword to my friends coming here .
This weekend is going to finish after 2 hours .
I have to sleep early today .
It 's my birthday yesterday .

There are many stars in the sky at midnight .
I did n't know that we can see it all directly even though except a telescope .
Also I was noticed my city is bright .

I was living at Tokyo in Japan before I 've come Canada since 30th , May , 2011 .
Tokyo is busy and always crowded that why .
I hope I could live in a rural place .
I was surprised when I knew about this website .
Of course , this is because the aged have more money than the younger .
In an aging society , the aged are important targets .
Saving money is loomig as the bad circulation .
Ailing Japan eyes a salvation of attracting the aged .
I am plannning to stay in Hong Kong for a month .
And I 've serched information about where to stay there .
In the place that I want to rent house , the average price you buy a house is about 350000 ( $ 5484 . 5 ) yuan per square meter and the average price you cost to rent 60 square meter house is about 5000 yuan per month .
Consider you are the house owner , the house will cost you 2100000 yuan .
If you let the house , you can get 60000 yuan one year .
That is to say , you money only grow in a rate of 2 . 86 % , while the current one - year deposit rate is 3 . 5 % .
With the fact that the house price have stopped from rising , why not the house owner sell the house and deposit the money to bank or doing other investment ?
Is the housing price in Beijing is too more high ?
I would like to the housing price and rent place in your place , could you tell me ?

Lunch Time Trip !
My office is near by a botanical garden .
So sometimes I go there to have a lunch .
I usually buy breads and drink , and bring it to there .
In the garden , there is also a small restraint .
Having a lunch under cherry blossoms is a fantastic experience !
Moreover , a small mountain and a lake is also near by my office .
It takes about 5 minutes by bicycle .
There is also cafe & dinning by the lake .
Sometime , I take a hotdog and a couple of coffee .
Or another time , I eat TAKOYAKI , a kind of snack which is famous in western area of Japan .
In spring , I can see a new branch of trees .
Having a lunch in the atmosphere is very comfortable .

Now , I have to increase my English skill because it is essential for the college entrance examination .
The college I want to enter demand very flexible English skill .
But I was not hard learner , so I can not write English sentences fluently .
By the way , I think it 's very silly to learn another language just for passing the exam .
I can introduce some of Japanese things if you write as a comment .
I 'm glad if you correct my sentences very strictly because I really want to write in English quite naturally .
A new semster !
Tomorrow a new semster will begin .
After one and a half year I will graduate from my college .
I have prepared to take the IELTS exam in May .

Back then , it was n't takes time long until I could print it out .
It is hard to keep up with new technology .
After this , I will play handball ! !
And I left a hospital yesterday .
Accident : (
I fell over by bicycle on my way home .
I have never fallen down by scooter so it was been a long time since I have hurt myself .
How the accident has happened is I was riding along a road but then the road disappeared so I had to go over to a carriageway , there was a small step , I tried to step over but I could n't since I was going kind of perpendicular to the road and tumbled over with the bicycle .
I scraped my knees and elbows plus , got blues .
However In some way , I think I was lucky , it could be worse .
I am glad there was no car coming behind me .
I remember when I was little , I hurt myself exactly the same way .
Bicycle is dangerous .
My bicycle 's handlebar bent , so I had to keep it diagonally to keep going straight .
The wound is not too bad but I was a bit embarrassed .
Even the small steps scared me and I was riding very carefully .
It has a long time I did n't write an entry and now I 'm here again .
I been stopping learning Korean for a number of weeks already .
These days I just realized that I should learn my ENGLISH !
I 'm figuring out what 's wrong with my English .
For the past few weeks , I been playing a website called Omegle .
It 's a website who is random let you talk to strangers .
It lets me know my English level .
I can not understand English Native Speakers .
I think that 's a lot of slang inside their conversations .
Do you think I talk to them will improve my English skills ? ?
So I know North Korea has been making nuke weapon ! ! !
And I watched on TV that US jernalists were detained in North Korea .
They did n't know the situation there ?
jernalists are so crazy that go to dangrous places , even though there is possibility to die .
I respect them , but I will never go to war place ! ! !
Is it Korea or Japan ?
Or are they brave enough to attack US directly ?
Anyway no country is interested in Philippines , so . . . .
What a peaceful world here ! ! ! ! !
I heard there are some pirates in the Philippines , and they kidnap people and kill them .
Maybe bandit too .
I think he live in my house . . .
`` You have your whole live ahead of you ``
That is one person 's word which I 've just got when I ask something about live in a little while ago .
I sometime feel insecure about my way if I should get things going whether or not .
I kind of hesitate to do .
In that time , someone give me a supportive small push in right way .
I wish I could become like one of them someday .
I went to the library near my company , in the lunch time .
I read some magazines , about fashion , money , moter cycle and so on .
This library is the biggest in my city , so many books in there .
I found the book in Amazon site , so I want to rent the book tomorrow .
Yesterday I met a friend who studies law in my university .
He called me on the phone when I was eating lunch in campus .
In the afternoon , We met at a cafe in front of s station near my university .
He seems to me that he want someone he can talk without any constraint .
Law is not my field , but soon I realized I 'm interested in it , especially when he talked about a relationship between criminal law and psychiatry .
He looked like enjoying himself by talking his matter of concern .
It seems that high school life is not far behind , those happy moments occur to me all the time .
I was like what if I could stay at that time forever , but I know my mind now have changed a lot .
And I would n't have thought I would go this far .
All I 'm thinking now is how I can get a good , promising job , improving myself , socializing with other people and getting my English , especially oral English , even better .
And I think it 's quite a long time that I did n't post any English article on the website , and it might be the best time for me to practice my second language by using Lang - 8 .
I would force myself to write something in English every day .
Thank U ! !
I 'm going to speak about me in English at 10PM .
So , I will write what I 'm gond to say .
I ran a fullmarathon two weeks ago .
It was n't TOKYO marathon .
I talk with my friends on Skype lately .
I 'm really glad to join this group .
I felt bad because I am not used to accept expensive gifts from people .
In the morning and night , twice !
I was really tired and felt down .
I remembered my teacher told us this when I was a high school student , he said : `` One of the most happiness is that you have a work for your living , and you really like it . `` I did n't understand at that time .
I thought I would n't do anything if I dislike it .
As other almost Chinese students , I offered too many time to learn for the university entrance examination .
Luckily , I entered a good university and after graduation , I get a job in a company .
But the problem is I do n't like my work .
I never try to do anything besides learning knowledge for the exam .
I do n't even know what I real like .
So my coworker and I went to barraks for checking two of the rooms .
Horrible .
Filthy rooms are clean now .
Today is hot in Japan . . .
very hot for me .
Today 's menu fry minced meat with rice and sunny - side up !
As you know , Bruins won the Stanley Cup this year !
The end of the parade route was Copley Square , and I got there .

I thought all the people in Boston came to downtown yesterday .
To make matter worse , the weather was so hot . . .
This was the first time watching a parade in Boston , even I 'm not a big fan of the ice - hockey , It was awesome .
I hope that Red Sox will be a winner of Wolrd Series , then I 'll have a chance to watch a parade again !

I have never studied history since I was junior high school student .
I felt ashamed because I know less about Japanese history than American friend .
I think that many young Japanese do n't know about history .
We do n't know about own country and foreign country .
Though It takes 5 hours to go to Hiroshima , I 'm very excited .
Eating Local Foods
I 'm happy that I ate most of things I wanted to eat in Amsterdam .

Happy Valentines Day
Travel plan going to East coast
My plan is to go to East coast because I have never been there and the area I want to visit are New York , Washington D .
C and Florida .
I guess it would take more than a week if I will visit all famous tourist spots in those area and I 'm not sure whether I could take a vacation more than a week .
So , I might give up to visit some spots .
Anyway , I have to research how long I need to go around each location I want to go and then decide the duration of the trip .
I met a lady who had a something grey .
She told us if we touched it , we would be happier .
So many people wanted to touch it even we had to wait for a while .
There were about three hundred of people .
She made it using a towel which she bought at one hundred yen shop .
Do you know `` Unagi nobori `` in Japanese ?
If you touch `` Unae `` , you will be lucky rapidly .
Actually she has been lucky since she made `` Unae `` .
She can meet many people and talk together .
If you want to know about `` Unae `` , please visit this site .

Would you please tell me what is the natural way to ask someone for a favor , especially when we have a question , like what I am doing .
Checking a lot of forums about English usage , I noticed that many questioners add a thanks phrase at the end of their questions , like , `` Thanks in advance for your help , `` or just `` Thanks . `` Japanese usually do n't say in this way but instead we use a different form of phrases to finish a favor .
Thanks in advance of your great help .

hapyy day
today is very happy , bacause my class was very funny .
They alway make me happy .
One of my goal is communicating without problem in English with the people whose mother language is English .
So , please do n't hesitate to revise my poor English although it 's tiny tiny mistake , misuse , or nuance problem .
I believe there are kind people in this community Lang - 8 and hope they will help me with English for improving my English ability .
I study like this .
Today , I have the chance to speak English .
I think it is better to learn conversation and know our cultures than study vocabulary .
So I want to watch movies but it ` s too expenive for me . . .
Today I thought about posting a video from a French movie , in which the scene takes place in Harlem .
So the protagonists speak English of course , and then everybody could understand the video , I do n't need to transcribe or to translate .
I introduce a little bit the movie : The movie , takes place in the 1980s , it 's a comic French movie as they were very popular in France .
The main character is played by Michel Colucci a . k . a Coluche , a very popular French humorist ( one man show ) and actor .
In this movie , the protagonist ( Coluche ) works for an insurance society and have to travel around the world to bring back the unlucky tourists who have unfortunately had problems or accidents , in France .
Thus , in the movie , Coluche travels around the world , and experiences some adventures in various countries such as Marocco , United - States ( Harlem ) , China and so on . . .
It 's one of my favorite French comedies , I still laugh each time I watch it , even at this very moment writing the entry and listening to the extract at the same time .
I think it may be interesting to listen the French accent and the ( maybe exagerated ) view of Harlem by the French at the time .
The man says that New York is very dangerous and warns Coluche to be careful , especially from the black people who attacks the whites .
Coluche who was not afraid before he met the man , is now very tensed and afraid . . .
And asks him to go to Harlem , but even the black taxi - driver refuses to go so far and leaves him close to the district .
And the video begins as we see him walking on the Harlem deserted streets .
Surprised to see that this same man was in bandages and apparently injured .
He asks him what happened , and the answer is that the man has been attacked ( if I remember well , I even think that he was attacked by white men . . .
Which is funny as he only warned about the blacks ) .
The reason is maybe I worked in cold store yesterday .
The best during catching a cold is eating well and sleeping well .
My favourite season is summer , but not very hot .
Now in Russia is summer and it 's awfully hot ! ! ! We go to the river almost every day , but even bathing does n't retreat me from the heat ! I 've never imagined , that I will hope it will be winter now .
Winter I love too , but if you want to go for a walk in this season , you will be able to wear many clothes ! ! Autumn . . .
I hate autumn ! It 's often rains , it 's why you must n't go for a walk .
The sunshine is n't so hot , grass and leaves are green , birds are singing . . .
I accustom to summer 's heat and love it best of all !
I have to go to my office than usual after the snow fell heavily .
I also have to shovel snow around my house , car parks and offise . . .
In addition to this , traffic is so crouded . . .

I have been study English a few years but my English Writing and speaking is still not good so I want to learn native English at Lang - 8 ( ^ _ ^ ) /

Nagano in Japan

Sometimes when I take a walk with my dog a sidewalk , I feel danger because of bicycles .
In Japan , we have the rule that defines bicycles as a kind of car that has risk .
But some people who ride bicycles do n't know or understand it 's risk .
I sometimes watched on TV that in Paris there are roads for bicycles .
I hope that my city also prepare bicycle 's roads for safety .

There are two types of foreigners who were in Japan before earthquake happened .
Some foreigners in Japan went back home country .
However , It is founded that Tokyo may be safe area this week , so they try to come back Japan .
I hear that when they come back Japan , they have problem .
Other workers who did not leave in their company were continuing to work and they may be angry .
In fact , they imposed their work to other worker , but I think safe is the most important and they should be welcomed to their company .
A random thought on Energy
While I was searching some information about alternative energy for 5 minutes speech , a thought occurred to me .
It is necessary that we use another energy to develop alternative energy .
In capitalism , it is inevitable that alternative energy become to be means for profits .
So I think what we need now is not developing energy but less consuming that .
In modern society , especially in urban life , we have dependant on energy too much .
For example , when I come back home after work , I use water and gas energy to take a shower .
I surf the internet with an air - conditioner and a fan turn on , after finishing web surfing , I watch TV with the dest - top still on and use a stove and microwave to have a dinner .
Before going to bed , I usually read a book listening to the music unless I drink at the pub .
I went thought blackout once during staying in the Philippines .
I totally realized that how much I depend on energy .
Darkness made me a fool who could n't anything at all .
I was just sitting in front of my laptop in darkness for a while .
Next thing I know , darkness suddenly came to me .
So I went outside felling my way .
I could n't nothing .
electronic devices had n't been recharged were useless such as a laptop , tv , mp3 player , even refrigerator .
All I could do was drink beer going vapid in the frigerator .
Fossil fuel is limited and getting exhausted .
Therefore we will develop alternative energy someday .
But the energy itself will be merely a commodity to be sold or bought in capitalism .
We also made carbondyxide a commodity even sell and buy the right of emission .
I think it 's impossible that sustainable development is realized .
The concept of sustainable development must have been made by capitalists who wanted to legitamize much more development and exploitation .
Development and exploitation were already enough .
Unless we do so , we will be attacked on by nature like huge climate change as much as we exploit .
Because of the early airplane , I fall asleep while the plane was flying .
When I woke up , I heard a sound like glasses fell to the floor .
I realized that it was my glasses , but I could not see where they are after touching for a while .
although I even did not know who he likes .
He was very friendly brought it to me ,
then I noticed he was looked like a gentleman with full of understanding ,
as same as my age , maybe ? wearing a glasses .
After continuing exploratory talks , we found that eacher other actually produced a good impression , because we enjoyed our talking , we had a really nice time , we will be close friends in the life .
I think oil spill accident in the gulf of mexico is very important thing in the world .
Depending on a case , I think it is more important than the economic problem or the religion or the war or the poverty or any other problem .
because It affects the whole world , nobody knows a solution , nobody are predictable .
But We hardly hear the news about accident on TV in Japan .
You guy do really speak like that ! ?
`` West of mountains are broad and fairly flat plains . ``
I can understand the meaning of it , but Is it awkward for the English reader or listner ?
englis again !
I tell to myselef again and again after an english lecture every time : I must learn english now !
it 's really looks nice here .
I have sent many messages to strangers who speak english .
I hope their reply .
I hate english , because I learn it for eight years , but I ca n't listen a lecture well , and I ca n't read an english paper well .
I really need this language tool to prove my work .
so , I hope english speakers to be my friends .
So I think it 's memorable to keep something down here .
I have to admit age is a becoming more and more sensitive as I get older and older , and the older I got , the more responsiblity comes along and the more mature you should behave .
Well , I think I wish I could welcome the moment at home as usualy , but I failed for the last conple of days which flashed through so quickly in a northern city I have never been to before .
Travelling makes the time elapse so quicky that I have hardly anytime to digest the change of age satisfactorily , Even though I have been able to come back home this morning , I still ca n't take my time and am actually struggling to keep awake to digest it as much as I can , because I hardly sleep yesterday .
n't tell others , okay ?
- Daikon - Oroshi is a mashed Japanese white radish .
He got angry and swung his kitchen knife , his daughter resisted with her cane and escaped .
And then the police caught him in the act of doing it .

I found it terrible when I had the first spaghetti in UK .
It was boiled for too long time and too soft for me .
Moreover , I felt bad when I bought a can of spaghetti and had it because gelly spaghetti appeared and I regarding that can as a can of meat sauce .
In Japan the far east country , we did n't know al dente in the past .
that 's because we have traditional noodles , which are Udon and Soba , which are basically boiled till their core were boiled .
However , we know that 's far better to have spaghetti in that way nowadays .
Why is n't al dente that common in this Europian country whose people are most omnivorous .

The primary reason that I watched this movie because I just wanted to relax for a little bit after knew we still ca n't get the annual bonus again this year .
Plus , the movie scene inside looks could n't be better .
This movie is talking about two different American girls spent their summer to Barcelona where they have a romantic , unforgettable advanture .
Mealwhile , they are still learning how to face some subject in their life .
Movie 's siprit seems give us a possibility that everything is possible , especially relate to love .
When it cames to subject to the love , some people tend to relistic , some people are always expect something very different .
I can understand how 's feel when people want to chase , find something in their life , but do n't know what 's exactly purpose .
Therefore , whatever what kind of life you want , it 's our choice .
But I think most people in our country , we do n't have enough encourage to change the situation , or sometimes we just carry more moral respnsibility .
Our space is near the sea and the station , and when I arrived there , there were some friends .
And we had waited while eating and drinking for starting the fireworks show . . .
We have been tired , but when we watched them , we forgot our fatigue .
The fireworks was the most beautifl which I had watched ever .
Please watch them with my picture ^ ^ In fact , more beautiful ! !
Or , I weared a yukata for a long time so I was happy .
I say about my fun .
My fun is to watch favorite TV programs .
So when I come home about all programs I want to watch has done .
As I record programs to my Blu - ray disk .
In recent days I 'll write about my favorite programs .
Some university students find they benefit from part - time work while others say that working even part - time would prevent them from making the most of their studies . Discuss the merits of both arguments . With which point of view do you agree with regard to your country and why ?
Some students need to find job for living , but others have choice if they work or no for extra money .
Also some of them say work would obstacle for their study .
But I agree with that students do part - time even in Japan .
So they do not need to work , though they still need some extra money for cloth dating and so on .
I think there are few students who work for living cost like foods , house rent , utility bill .
Thats why it seems unnecessary experience .
Cooperation skill is very important , so if they wo n't do any job while they are student , after graduate they may face some difficulty such as related with social and coping skill in the future .
Also they would know how time is precious and enhance their time management skill .
In conclusion , part - time job is beneficial but students should n't spend too much time for a little extra money .
I hear news that one of oldest and most famous restaurants in Rome was punished with suspending business operation because they dishonestly charged a Japanese couple about 700 Euros for lunch .
They can not speak Italian or English , but their Japanese hotel owner went to the police with them and claimed it .
I was surprised that they paid it with their credit card !
If I were them , I would make complaint in English , anyway .
But they might threaten me or pretend not understanding English . . . .
What can I do ? ? ?
P ' Pun suggested this site to me and I really appreciated him . .

The best traditional peruvian food of all the places I 've already ate .
It 's located in the San Martin 1062 avenue Pueblo Libre .
Particularly , they have a great and good variety of food , a big menu of traditional meals and dishes such as papa rellena , ceviche , butifarra and one of the most famous is `` choritos a la chalaca `` .
The whole place has an structure of our colonial time !
I think is one of the only places in the capital city that maintains these traditions .
Inside of the restaurant , you will see many pictures about the time when this place was under construction , pictures of our first monorail , the first cars in peru , etc .
The waiters are a bit old but they are really good .
I feel very pleasant every time I go there , you ca n't not only find out about our food , but also you can find out a little bit about our history !
and there are a lot of foreigners going there as well .
The price it 's quite normal and I find it reasonable since they cook very well . .
I would like to recommend this restaurant for all the tourists who are coming to visit Peru , if you plan to fill your stomach with something tradtional , fast , unique and good with such a ancient place like this , do n't hesistate and go find it out for your own .
I 'm writting my first post , and I need to your help to explore my english .

After a few days , his eyes are getting better but he 's still thin .
This noon , when I checked how he was doing , his box was empty .
The housemaid said , that he went to the veranda , jumped from the second floor , and escaped through the front gate .
It seems like the summer is back .

She told me that this facility was one of checkpoints of Oxfam Trailwalk .
Actually the checkpoint I saw yesterday was that for 80 km .
She said that they were waling another 20 km for the rest of the day .
This event is also fund - raising event .
as they might fear the nuclear crisis and aftershock of the 3 . 11 earthquake .
Some wore T - shirts on which some encouraging messages for Japan were written .
It is fourth time for her to participate the Olympic game .
The result of her first olympic in Nagano Japan , was the 7th place , the second 's one in saltlake city U .
Her performance and condition were better than she was and other players , but the result was 4th place .
I was hoping she would be a medalist .
After the game she said `` I could n't reach the medal but I did it and I did my best . ``
That made me think I would support her ever though I am not ure that she will continue to play mogul .
Anywany , I think it 's going to be an excitig Olympic .
If you want to learn Japanese , I willing to help as much as possible .
I enjoy school festival from October 9th to 11th .
There is a concert , and I play the Trombone .
Many people came to look our concert , so I was very happy .
I think I will be very hard for next concert .
I write easy and short sentence this time .
I will write more difficult ( concrete ) and long sentence next .
Today I had a English meeting with three representatives of our company customers .
I met three colleagues in Tokyo station then headed to Utsunomiya station where we were going to meet them .
I was a little bit nervous yesterday so called my mom to ask her the points I have to keep in mind in the business meeting in English .
Most Japanese do n't understand the basic concept of `` shake hands , `` She said .
Huge earthquake and tsunami have attacked my prefecture
I could not believe my eyes at all when I saw that on TV .
Because now I live in Thailand .
So it is inconvenient to get the precise information .
I went for a drink with my colleague and watched a BBC program .
What I saw there , is an atrocious scene .
Large amount of cars , houses , people had floated .
Walls and signboards had fell .
The worth things , the focus of the earthquake is near my house .
My mother and my sister still live there .
And apart from them , my father and younger brother also is in the prefecture .
Therefore I called with my cellphone to them .
I was so worried about of them .
I can not help stopping to see internet to get any information .
For example , ustream , twitter , facebook
She said they are all safe and stay at home together now .
I felt relieved a little .
the damage of nuclear is so terrible .
All I have to do is to pray for their safety .
Today I got a phone call that Mrs huang asks me to interview in her company .
It 's third calls untill this moment , but I did n't go anyone .
Sometime I regret my decision , but I have no way because of my studies .
I do n't perpare for it entirely .
I do n't know how to dress up and how to deal with one and one hard questions that I can n't answer .
Now , I 'm confused .
I ` m college student and I live dormitory .
Dormitory have curfew .
So even If I ` m hungry , I don ` t go to a supermarket to buy food .
But I ` m hungry now .
We went to toboggan to the hill in my neighborhood .
This is my first time to try to toboggan , although I have skied or snowboarded .
That was so scary !
At first I saw it lightly and I thought it is the sport just for kids .
It is like coasters .
The more it went down , the more speed it got .
The speed is outrageous .
Besides I could n't control well .
I actually stroke on a children .
Fortunately she did n't hurt , but my mind went blank at the moment .
I admired children because they have no fear .
I guess there are a lot of opportunity to toboggan here and I have to improve it for not be beaten by children .
I considerably got drunk .
I will sleep ahead of time today .
It is far more difficult than we think to behave like that way .
Because ensemble requires cooperation , listening to other is very important .
It also applies to daily conversations .
It was n't finish .
I 'll try next day .
hey ~
this is anne who keep listening 575 by perfume ( japanese artist ) these days .

this is one of the most kawaii and useful bookstores ive ever been .
and I had a banana tart with cream and a cup of soy latte .
I wish that place was non - smorking place and
I wish I could stay more . . .
( you have to order more if you want to stay there over 2 hours . . . )

so many books are there .

I am testing whether Lang - 8 has really become faster after its maintenance and I think it is working just fine .
The access speed is very critical for an SNS and I really appreciate the effort which the staff has made so far .
Now I can keep my language practices .
I was thinking about create proxy that is difficult .
but today , I wrote it .
like pice of cake .
but use that code , I can access that URL .
That mechanism is , When I accsess `` URL `` , proxy responce `` URL `` .
normaly , Ajax can not cross site .
but , but use this mechanism , perhaps , I can do it .
Hello , I 'm a new here .
But then I realized it was the interesting one ; therefore , I have registered here .
People say I 'm making a big progress , but I do n't think so .
Because my spoken English is still poor .
I often talk to native speakers , but as a matter of fact , I do n't understand them too much .
Yesterday , the rainy season began at Kyusyu district , which is located to southwestern part of Japan .
It will begin at all part of the country in the next few days .
I do n't like this season because it is difficult to go out at a rainy day .
But you can see beautiful hydrangea at the rainy season in Japan .
My hair is divided on the left side .
When I put down my hair , it is about the length to my middle back .
I am planning to grow it longer best to my lower back .
I used to wear bang .
Since I was told to reveal my forehead to have better luck , I grew the front hair and pull it to the side .
That shop always put a flower in a big vase .
Today 's flower was `` fox face `` .
My friend is a teather of junior college .

In the train , a high school student sit down on a chair .
In front of him , an elderly woman appeared .
He said to her ' Sit down , please . '
But she declined that proposal so he felt embarassed and pity to say so .
A week later , ahead of elderly man , the student become to sit down without saying anything .
What would you do in that situation if you were the student ?
But you should know there are people who do n't want to be said so .
Women love talking .
My friend and I were going to do the homework after classes .
we were doing the homework at the good pace .
But we talked about our high school days to refresh ourselves because we were tired .
and we had not time to do the homework , so we went to each home .
It is very fun of me to talk with my friends .
Probably , most women will like it .
I 'm a Jaapanese .
I like cat .
She name is Karupin .
She waked up me at seven everyday .
But she sleep together .
It 's very cute and I feel rilax .
Today , m worked as intern in a small venture company .
In this company , there are only four people there and some intern students including me .
This company deal with some It like business .
And today after the working I had a dinner with my acquaintance , a person who is workin in the famous consulting company accenture .
He is also born in Kansai area , I mean Osaka , so the tempo we are talking matches .
The topic came to the experience I had in my Phillipine trip that I had in this August .
This trip was held by all myself to see the thoroughly different culture and study English , and my trial resulted in success .
I could experienced precious time .
And as I talked about that topic , I do n't know why , but I noticed tears in my eyes .
This is probably because of that experience , I had there , that is what I saw in slam area and people in poverty and what I felt unreasonable .
I thought I want to heartily changed this situation , people who naturally did n't do anything wrong .
I thought again , and what should I do ?
I asked to myself again in my mind , but my answer still could n't come back .
From the angle where I was seated , I could see Yossy and behind her the gloomy , stormy weather in Tokyo through the window , but could n't hear any sounds of the rain or thunder .
If you had stood next to the sliding door of the room hearing what was being talked inside , you might have heard intermittet laughing sounds made by a female , and monotonous , enthusiastic talks by a male , which might have gave you an impression ; the atmosphere was not too bad , or too good either .
It has been about 2 weeks I had joined this site .
Surely , I got many friends that really wanted to help me .
However , I only found a friend on this site which was really kind and concern .
She was Laura also called as Amaya , .
She was from US .
She always helped me on every journals that I have written .
She also corrected me .
I 'm proud of her because even though she was busy working and studying .
She still got time to help me .
So , I would like to thank to Amaya for her helps and advices .
I hope she will achieve her dream to study in Japan .
On birthday , families gather and wish each other well .

At that time I did n't know how to eat them , so I poured milk over them , which did n't taste very well .
In Tokyo I found out muesli in a grocery .
I saw that we should make them soft by soaking them for several hours in yogurt .
It seemed a good idea .
I bought a pacake of muesli , mixed them with yogurt and put it in my refrigerator at night before going to bed .
In the next morning I had it with fruits jam .
It was so delicious that it was necessary for my breakfast .
I will be fun .
I Think Myself on the Quick Sand
We 've had no longer lifetime employment system sice late 80 's .
Instead , I 've watched powerful harassment like `` you 're incompintent ! `` or `` we do n't afford to pay dude like you . `` in order to enforce them early ritirement .
After introducing the performance system to mimic the US , teamwork does not work and we think co - workers as enemies .
We used to be happy and energetic even if we had hard time in a
We , however , exploit temporary staff and live in dog - eat - dog world .
We bully weakers and weakers bully weakests .
Luckly I have a job and depenadable payment .
But , I sometimes feel
helpless when my colleague left the office .
I 've just remembered I knew `` xxx `` has `` that `` meaning when everyone told me , and I do n't want you guys to mislead my name any more !
My cute `` My Little Pony `` should not connet to such a nasty word .
lololol No , they shoud not . . . . . . . . .
We just know `` Kiss Kiss Kiss `` , so you can see cute and classy Japanese girls have usernames include `` xxx `` on twitter !
Believe or not , we just think `` xxx `` looks `` Kawaii `` .
The reason my new name became `` Chloe `` is my real name starts `` C `` also .
: - ) I think `` Cindy `` is good one , too .
My deepest condolence to the earthquake victims .
I 'm pretty sad about the earthquake happened in Japan these days .
Good luck to all the people live in Japan !
My company 's office hour is supposed to be from 10 : 00 to 7 : 00pm .
But , nobody leave office at 7 : 00 .
My coworker all work untill late night .
I do n't know exactly what time they go back to home because I 'm first three people to leave office .
I usually leave office around 7 : 30 .
I want to finish job exactly 7 : 00 and enjoy my private life .
But It 's awkward to leave office to 7 while other are working silently . . .
I 'm not confident about getting a high score very much , but I 'll try my best .
One of my friends on skype told me that all you have to do is concetrate on the exam and relax .
Certainly , To relax is necessary to get a high score .
Since I 've written some journals about TOEIC , you might have guessed that I risk my life for it , but it 's not true .
Well , studying bussiess English is bloody boring .
I do n't think very much that bussiness English must be needed to communicate with foreign people .
what should I write to my pen pals ?
if everything would be so easy then I just start writing right now . . .
it 's big `` dilemma `` .
can you recommend me something ?
Two weeks ago I bought a new portable DVD player that is region free at an online - shop .
Although I like it , I realized that some DVDs do not work .
I have lots of American DVDs whose region cord is 1 in my house .
After I looked for why I can not watch some of them , I discovered there are some DVDs that is difficult to recognize the region cord with a region free DVD player .
That is why some my DVDs can not work with my DVD player .
So , I am thinking when I go to America next time , I am planning to buy a portable region cord 1 's DVD player .
I think if I bought it , since all my DVDs are region cord 1 , I could watch all of them .
Although I have to stand this situation before I will go to America , I think it is a good idea .
I hope I will be able to buy a good one with a good price .
I 've got a strained back when I took a DVD of 24 .
It 's too heavy to me ?
It is last question lol
When I speak Englsh , though It is n't perfect sentence , a native speaker can understand what I mean .
But I always wonder my English is right . .
I have never visit foreign country .
As an English learner , definitely , It is necessary to go to abroad , But I did not have enough money .
I heard about Sookmyung university TESOL course is linked foreign university , so after finish the course I hope to study going in foreign university .
As an English learner , I felt the English education in Korea was not effective .
Through the TESOL course , I hope to improve myself as the good English teacher .
After finish the course I will practice what I learned in Kindergarten and if the chance comes to me I want to go to graduate school .
However , the interface is not sophisticated as that of iPhone .
Moreover , the display speed is very slow so that I feel stress a little .
Amazon should design Kindle to show the progress status clearly when it takes several seconds to finish some operation .
Recently I have a gluttonous appetite . . . .
And the day before ate a dinner but I ate two humburger late at night . .
Be hungry soon ahter eating . . .
why ? ? ?
Morning !
I founded to Mr hou8592984 's brog .
His chinese fairytales are such a fantastic !
How do you think about lying ?
Some people say that it 's not good to tell a lie even it has a reason to do it , others say that some times we need to lie to make people feel better .
How do you think about it ?
In order to continute to write English , I should decide a thema .
Thema : Depression Journal
Reasons : Now my husband is working for schools as a Japanese teacher .
By writing his depressio journal , I would like depressive patients and their family to know about this disease and surely believe his or her recovery .
( This is possibly due to my little reading experience , my being lazy and ignorant . ) I certainly enjoyed reading it in the original a couple of years ago , and for that now I probably need the dictionary no more .
Now I stay in my aunt house .
Every time I 'm going to be on a trip , I visit here .
There are five people here , uncle and aunt , uncle 's mother , cousin who is a man , cousin who is a single mother and has a baby .
I did not drink alchohol a couple days .
I was a very good girl .
I did n't drink yesterday too .
I have teaching a dance class every thursday . ( yesterday was thursday )
I was so rushing to go to a dance studio .
I was late to leave my place .
I run to a station , and I found it out when I took train .
I wore two different shoes on my foot . . .
Those shoes are different colors , different shapes .
I really wanted to go back to change them , but I did 't have time to do it .
so I took train wearing two different shoes .
I was standing by one foot on the train .
when I got the studio , everybody laughed at me so hard .
I was dying to laugh .
This couple week , I 've been very busy .
I have a lot of things to do , so maybe I was tired ? !
I know It 's not good excuse .
I played futsal for the first time in three weeks and scored four goals and did four assists .
Btw , I 'm going to buy a present for gift exchange party on Christmas but do n't know what to buy because the present is n't for someone special .
I could n't using a computer for a long time .
So , I could n't send my return message .
I am sorry for the delay in my response .
And I 'm just feeling a little depressed about Japan .
The site is really good because many people who learn second or third language in there and all of us help each other ; correct our each writing .
Until recent I had given up writing continuously several times , however the site is like a social community and I can visit there as possible I can .
So I could keep writing more frequently .
As my friend in the site say , I need to read more English writing .
The article was about a girl who had New Zealand father and Japanese mother .
She hate her looking until she was teenager .
But later she found about her beauty herself and became a fashion model .
I was impressed about her story .
After that I am thinking magazines are good for reading , but I can not afford to buy new magazines and I do not want to read old magazines from secondhand shops .
However I might have to buy new magazine sometimes .
Recently , I have got a Blow Off Valve for car .
She lives in Tokyo to go to a uni she selected , so we have n't seen each other for a while .
We talked a lot of things and cracked up : - >
I like cooking more than anything else , but I 'm wondering deeply if I should go into the way of cooking . . .
In addition , I really like cooking , but am not good at cooking very much .
And if you live in France , please give me some information about France . ( In English , please . )
If we had a large garden , we could barbecue there .
If you were absent in the class , you would be yelled at by the teacher .
If you had left a message on my phone , I would have called you back .
A : Why did you ride a bike to her home yesterday ?
It was too far from your house , was n't it ?
B : If I had had a car , I would have gone there by a car .
Today I sold my guitar today because I 'm going back to Japan soon and I ca n't afford to take my guitar to Japan .
I bought my guitar 10 months ago and have played everyday before going to bed .
I told my sister to play my guitars in Japan constantly because my instruments feel lonely .
There is a fact that your instruments will go bad if you do n't play them for a long time .
I ca n't believe that National Central Library changed my intern time , and they did n't tell me !
So unfortunately , I have to cancel my part - time job during my summer vacation , and also make me lose at least 8000 NT dollars .
but I do n't know how to make it .
how do everyone get many friends ?
if I send message to stranger like `` hello May I be one of your friend ? ``
I really think we will be good language partner : ) `` ?
I have n't ever approach to people so much .
Is this really japanese thinking ?

But I notice Japanese difficult .
I am Japanese but Japanese language has many confusing .

When have you traveled somewhere recently ?
I have been to Turkey last summer .
I went to Cappadocia .
Cappadocia is very interesting because there are many characteristic rocks .
One of them is like a camel ( Picture1 is it ) .
I scaled rocks and scenery which I saw from the upper part of rocks is so beautiful and amazing .
I was impressed with the beauty of nature .
I found a difference of summer between Germany and Japan .
In Japan , we listen the buzzing of cicadas everytime and everywhere .
I love summer better than winter , because I like swimming , watermelon , and firework etc .
I have to try to save on electricity this year , so I 'm going to buy a Japanese fan .
Why I 'm studying English is to communicate with people from other countries and to study jewellery design in Amsterdam ( the Netherlands ) .
I baked a cake unless using eggs and butter last week .
I really really like them .
But almost sweets are very high calorie .
So I thought out how to bake a cake without much oil , eggs and the other high calories stuff .
Ofcourse it should be yummy !
It was light taste and yummy .
My mother told me she loved it too .
This recipe have became my regular menu !
It was spicy but tasty .
The price was more expensive than other restaurant , but service was better .
There was the music band played nice music .
I 'd like to go to again .
2nd - anniversary of going out with my girlfriend .
Today is 2nd - anniversary of going out with my girlfriend .
First , we went to American Village .
She bought me a bottom and two shirts .
It 's so cool !
Second , we went to Kaiyukan ( This is aquarium in Osaka ) .
We looked at many fishes and took many photos .
I will buy present for her ( because we did n't have time today ) .
I 've got to know here just a few days ago .
I do n't know who made this website , but I wanna appreciate him / her .
It 's very interesting place to get participated in ! : )
I love riding bicycle !
We can enjoy Miku to sing songs as we like .
They made her sing in front of hundreds people ! !
Miku took her first concert in Tokyo and America .
I felt deep impression when I saw her concert DVD .
I sang together her and an audience in DVD ( ^ ^ ;
Now Japan economy is decreasing .
The automobile has been an main engine for Japanese economy for a long time .
In 1960 's and 70 's any young people longed a car .
I 'm sure Miku 's concert is first thing ! ( ^ ^ ) I 'm very very glad to see Game Character coming to see me out of PC .
I went to Yuasa town yesterday for business trip .
That town is well know as old soy souse town .
Soy souse was made about 800 years ago in that town , so there are a lot of old soy souse and soy beans factory there .
We also visited soy souce musium .
Hey , I did n't write anything on lang - 8 for a long , long time .
Guess it was because fire in me did burn to the coal and I 've lost my spirit : (
So , in the past two years I 've changed a lot , now I 'm certainly more tolerant , focusing on my studying , but not forgetting about friends : D
And , I 'm korean who live in korea .
I really really want to study english with another country friends .
The life is full of temptations , especially in which someone study abroad .
My friend and I went to eat supper together for celebrate his future .
After we went to Internet to play game .
Next , we playing card , because the tine so long that we were hungry .
I and two men went to buy some food at 3 o ' clock in night .
Unfortunately none of one open , we watched a GuiPian called ' The grudge ' and sleeping .
under toomuch pressure
Of the most hot topic in my class , the pressure we under is talked frequently .
It is said that students in foreign usually get up at 9 : 00 and then go to school , and it is 3 : 00 when the school is over , right ? ? ? But the situation in our country is the opposite .
Not only the time table is amazing , but the content we learn is a lot .
Every term we study Chinese , Math , English , Physics , Chemtry , Biology , History , Politics , Geography , Music , Art , and Physical education , 13 in all .
That is scarried , do you think so ? ?
On the other hand , the knowledge we study is also difficult , too .
Now I give a subject for instance , which is the most difficult subject in one of our math test ( I use picture to show it ) :
First week have passed in Canada
But , I feel little difference between Japan and Canada because there are many Japanese students who belong to my same college at university , which I 'm staying .
It 's meaningless studying abroad , though I want to practice conversation in English .
Then , I am not good at hearing and conversation .
Does enyone tell me the way to progress with conversation skill ?
I am a student , study English for becoming fluently English speaker .
My stutent visa has been sent to my house from American embassy this morning .
I 'm feeling easy now getting the visa although I knew there is no problem . . .
It was first time to go to the American embassy .
When I got there , I was so surprised that there are a lot of people wainting outside the embassy .
More than 150 peaple were there .
Only 6 people per one time can get into the little house next to the gate , and that 's why we had to wait so long .
I had been standing for 1 hours .
I was lucky that day was not rainy or sunny . .
it is midsummer now but it was cool in that day .
Getting inside the house , The man checked me and my bag with the X - ray mathine .
To my surprise , I had to left my cellular phone .
and then , I finally could get inside the embassy .
It takes more 30 minutes to have done all things inside .
I needed to have an iterveiw and have my fingerprints took , too .
All funitures of the building was Amerincan style .
I feel like already being in U .
It was funny .
Have you ever been to Japanese Embassy in your country ?
How was it ?
I guess you do n't have to wait so long . . .
She usually say : `` I 'm so tired ! ! ``
now , my mother is reading English , because she want
I 'm only Middle school student .
I 'll sent it to you soon ! ! ^ ^
The leader of the department that I 'm taking told that most of sophomores including those who transfered to this college might 've gotten over 650 points at TOEIC .
And I had thought I was smarter than students who had studied at the college just because I transfered .
I found that wrong .
Actually , I do n't like to compare .
One of the reasons is becasue when you compare yourself with others and if there is someone smarter than you , you get very depressed , like you 're going to die .
Another reason is that I do n't like people who look down on someone esle , and when there is someone less smart than me , I find myself looking down on him .
As I wrote yesterday , I had to write a rough draft of short report on behalf of my elder daughter .
Today , I had to translate her message for the graduation ceremony .
She will be graduated from elementary school soon !
She had spent only 3 months in this elementary school , She needed to write some articles ;
But I am all anxiety now .
You know , my English skill is such poor and I do n't have any confidence to my writing at all .
If there were more time to submit , I would write the sentences here and ask to correct !
The Typhoon Is Approaching !
A typhoon is slowly on its way to Japan .
I 'm planning to travel to Gunma prefecture on September 2nd and 3rd .
So I 'm worried about it .
I 'll go to the hot spa and eat many delicious food such as crabs , steaks , desserts and so on at the hotel .
I studied English and about my major much in this summer vacation , so I want to take a rest and enjoy this trip !
I want to go to as many places as possible !
How I should do ?
I think , First I remember a lots of English words .
Next I remember a lots of nglish sentence .
she is one of my favorite Japanese singer .
I really like her songs especially a song following URL .
She has stopped her activity for her sick and now take a long break .
I really want her to be back and relase new songs someday .
Her song give me energy especially when I feel kind of down .
I think everyone have own faviriote song that make you feel better .
I like both Japanese song called J - pop and forieng music .
But Japanese musii is more confortable for me , maybe because it 's easy to understand the meaning of lyrics .
Speaking of lyrics in english song , it 's very hard to lisiten and understand compared to converstion . . .
Does anyone feel the same way when you hear song written in your larning language ?
In the future hopefully my english become good and understand rylics .
I have been studing English for eighteen years , starting from the school , continuing at the institute and now - by myself .
But I have no great successes in my studing .
For example , I can understand very small part of radio and tv brodcasting , dialogs in move pictures .
Could someone give me a hand ? Tow sentences , A : `` Do you like the green one ? `` and B : `` What about the blue one ? `` .
Can I transform A and B 's position in the following article ?
What 's the difference from `` do you like `` and `` what about `` ?

Since I started to work again , I can not write this lang - 8 journal so often .
Still I want to continue .

At New Year 's Day , we had New Years dishes `` Osechi `` .
But now most Japanese buy it at the supermaket and department store .
Because there once lived so many peoples in a family , and mother and grandmather made much dishes for their children and guests , however , there are many nuclear families in Japan and are few guests .
`` Osechi `` making is really hard work .
I miss the customs are going to lose .

I went to shopping with my husband a few days ago .
After we shopped , we went to bakery to buy next breakfast .
I paid money for bread and received the change but forgot to bring the bread . . .
I went to other store of same bakeries today .
I looked the price that I had forgotten the bread of .
Police of dog
I found below article .
( Q ) Where are you going to go next holiday ?
( A1 ) I will go to Kyoto next holiday with my wife .
( A2 ) I 'm going to go to Kyoto next holiday with my wife .
( A3 ) I 'm going to Kyoto next holiday with my wife .
( A2 ) means that you 've decided where to go since some time ago .
( A3 ) means that you 've decided where to go since some time ago , and
you have a trip detail .
( A3 ) is easy and simple than ( A2 ) , so sometimes we use ( A3 ) instead of ( A2 ) .
Does it make sense ?
It is Golden Week holiday periods in Japan now .
We have holidays up to 16 days .
The work training was finished , so I needed to go back my job was taught math .
Yesterday , my boss called my phone and told me some work in this day .
My boss said , he had some business in yesterday , so he needed me to do something .
The classroom jusy only two students ,
I needed to taught their homework .
The job was very easy for me .
Two students were twins , they were very smart .
New - type trousers
It 's been very hot around here these days .
It 's hard to sleep even for a single hour without using air conditioner .
Last night , I sweated a lot so I put all the clothes around me into wash machine .
I woke up feeling refreshed this morning and found no trousers in my room .
Great !
Everything seemed perfect .
I got trousers as cold as water .
I thought that I would be able to concentrate on work for today .
Please do n't say where I am posting this entry .
Obviously , the effect of the new - type trousers lasted only two hours .
Thank you for Miyako ^ ^

But it has a sign that if I 'll read a little more , it 'll turn out to be interesting . . .
I 'm looking forward to go San Francisco again .
My wife and I called him `` The Great Adventurer `` and praised his courage very much .
I think a lot of anxiety affected him very much and he did not know how to cope with it .
As he stayed up late last night , I told him to go to bed .
I think there was no particular reason .
Anyway , it was a very nice day for us .
I am looking forward to seeing how he will grow up from now on .
I must have got some kind of virus when I went to a town to do my christmas shoping .

I had been to five countries up to now but China was the most interesting country .
I want to go to not only Asia but also Europe in the future .
Medical Checkup for Breast Cancer
Today I got a half day off to have a periodic checkup for cancer .
I 've kept have it once in every year .
Today I was so tired too long time to wait for my turn .
But this checkup is really important for us .
I think Health is the most importamt thing for life .
Do you have the medical checkup periodically ?
After some days of rest I 'm recovered from the fever .
For celebrate I 've called my friendds and we 've decided to go to dance in a club of Caribbeanses dances ( salsa , merengue , bachata ) .
When we 've entered every my tought has addressed to music , so after I 've removed the coat quickly I 've begun to trigger me on the track .
Between all the Caribbeanses dances the one which I prefer it 's the salsa , because it expresses passion , characteristic that is part of me in fact I 'm a scorpion ^ ^ .
When I listen to this music , in particular Marc Anthony , I become an only thing with the melody and I feel free a lot that every thing around disappear and I feel only the hertbeat of my heart that follows the rhythm of the music .
The dance for me is like the air that breath , own the lack of this has rendered me impossible to be firm to bed when I had the fever . . . fortune that now I 'm not more badly ! ^ _ _ ^
Escapes from the club we are stopped in a beautiful bar where we have made breakfast with cornetto and cappuccino and speaking we have seen to be born the sun of the first morning . . . the dawn is a magnificent show !
First , YUI is from FUKUOKA and age is 22 years .
When she is 16 years , she was to attend Music coaching school .
Then , she was to contract a disease .
As she did n't have a little money , she began working at Chine 's food restaurant .
She 's daily began to busy . ( audition and hospital and task )
At last , one of audition passed her .
She was to be elected in 20000 peole .
A Little Hestitation and Nervous
I am so busy these days .
My group 's leader asked me prepare race speech and a show of accomplishments becasue have a vacant position for a secretary of youth league committee in the group .
I just have a little hesitation and nervous .
May be I should to take things coolly .
This picture is of baby tomato in my kitchen garden .
I grew some plants of tomato , eggplant and green pepper in April .
It was uncertainly weather in this spring , and I worried whether their plants grow up well .
Fortunately , some plants of tomato have many fruits .
Today is very good day ! ! !
I go to art school lesson trial in morning .
In order to taking an examination in College of Arts .
I must become skillful drawing rough sketch so examination ! !
Next I go to KARAOKE with a friend in afternoon .
I sing a lot of songs ! !
It 's exiting ! !
The manga is love story of 16P .
I just started to make it yesterday .
What 's a bad day !
Needless to say and no selection for me , I had to wear a lot of clothes and make my effort to keep my body warm before I went to school .
Yes , I had act a snowman today . . .
Actually , I did n't know and understand that why my school could n't provide the warm water to all of the students after they had finish their physiologically need .
Imagine that you have just finished pissing , when you are going to wash and clean your hands , you have to let the COLD water run through your hands .
What 's the ' great ' feeling that is !
The wind blowed my WET hands and I could feel my hands were shaking .
Whatever , I know that I have to challenge the nature again tomorrow , even if I do n't want to face it .
Every time I met a foreigner interested on learning spanish and also interested on lerning the language on a spanish speaking vountry their natural choice was Spain .
and I started wondering why .
It might be that spain is closer to them because in Europe all countries are kind of together , or the currency .
but then again , south america is far , I know , but by plane is what 1315 hours away from europe ?
Plain ticket , much more expensive . . .
then what .
many things we appreciate being ours are actually the heritage of Spanish , German , or holland emigrants .
but this mix of cultures together with the effect of time over our population make us a country rich on art and architecture .
Please if you are planning to visit a spanish speaking country , dont loose the chance of droping here or inany other neighbor country .
WE MUST THINK WHAT WE CAN DO
Japan had a big big earthquake too today .
We collected about 200000yen , maybe 1600000NZdallors for NZ .
Now what can I do for peaple in MIYAGI ? ?
The earthquake in this time was M 8 . 8 , and the earthquake MIYAGI had registered 7 on the Japanese scale .
We must something ! ! ! !
Today , I made `` Irish breakfast `` for my lunch .
It 's too heavy for me to eat all in morning , so I often do in evening .
I like this so much , but I feel that Irish bacon and black ( white ) pudding are slight salty for Japanese , so I eat bacon and bread together .
oh , I forgot fried tomato too .
Tomorrow , Im going to make Japanese potato pancake ( imo mochi ) .
Its like a ricecake and made by potato , tapioca flour , cheese , mayonese .
I have to use the rest of cheese , otherwise it will get mould .
I had exam

Shining bald as a billiard ball head .

Here is the summery of the story .
There is this young Indian woman who has an arranged marriage with a several - year older Indian man and they move to the U .
She gives a birth to a daughter in the new circumstance and one day , she meets this young , friendly , and attractive Indian guy in a park who came to the U .
I have a difficulty
I am studying of English words for getting high score on TOEFL test .
But I am having a trouble .
It is that I found it difficult for me to understand the scientific words .
Because their meaning are difficult if I translate their words from English into Japanese .
For example , `` Coriolis effect `` , `` spectrum `` and etc .
I do n't remember these words quite .
But I will , want to graduate from American university , so I will study hard ! ! !
My friend and I visited Morinaga company , and joined in factory - tour .
It made me happy so I 'm a chocoholic .
At end of the tour , a guide gave us `` Hi - chew `` , candy .
On June 9 , I joined to Google Develper 's Day .
At the event , Google gave me a Google phone - mobile phone with Android .
It facisnated me and I began to develop software for the platform .
I installed eclipse , which is the development environment for Java , and Android Development Toolkit ( ADT ) which is a plugin to make it easy to development on it .
Below picture is its snapshot .

I 've been thinking about writing blog in English , but I was n't sure how I could start it .
Today when I was net - surfing for blogs in English , I happened to find this site .
I majored in sociology at Sophia university in japan since I 'm interested in what affects people 's decisions whether to do something or not .
Unfortunately , I have n't achieved that yet , but now I 've chosen English education for my career and I 'm enjoying my work teaching students .
It was not only out of curiosity but also because I did n't feel that I fitted in my surroundings well .
I thought that if japan was not the best place to live in , just try another one .
You can choose where you live , you have choices - that makes you feel easy when you find yourself unfitted in your circumstance .
If you can speak english , you can live almost everywhere .
I 'm also interested in analyzing the types of societies .
I want to think about what type of a society japan is through my everyday experiences , and express my views on the Japanese society .
I wish to get feedback from people who visit my blog from overseas and exchange opinions about japan and your country .
When I cut my finger , a lot of blood ran out .
At that time , I was washing the dishes , and the sink became totaly red .
I was surprised , and rashed into the bath room to wash my hand .
I applied a Band - Aid , seeing the sink looking as if a scene of murder .
( E : examiner , M : me )
M : Yes I do .
I live with my wife , two sons and my mother .
M : We get together only once a year at my home .
M : There are a lot of famous spots .
E : What are the interesting places to visit in your hometown ?
It resembles the New Zealand .
As if the big blue moon speaks me . . .
I always chose stable way . . .
I always be afraid failure . . .
I always avoid true my feelings . . .
And probably I distress myself about my attitude .
The moonlight ask me to make life for yourself .
I wonder how many times should I see the moon to make a step toward . . .
This is tonight . . .
I just slept 5 hours yesterday because of church things .
and went to the church .
Hmm I borrowed 2 books for sister whom I know .
remember the sister whom I told to you ?
the preetiest sister whom
( damn , I do n't know how I express . )
2 weeks later , there will be exam awaiting me .
I decided my mind
This was a Japanese popular anime .
It is in the news , in Japan , that a man who name a tiger mask make a contribution for children 's institution .
Today I had the plenty of time in the afternoon so I took walk aroung my hometown .
At first I went return DVDs which I rent a few days ago .
And then I went to a book store which sold the second - hand books .
In fact when I was a high school student , I belonged to American Football club .
I used to a representative American Footballer of my prefeture . . . .
It 's ir really true ! !
He has n't been changed at all .
When I was about to go home , it 's going to be rain . . . .
I shoukd avoid to taking a bath . . .
It seems to be humid weather today .
Such a weather is no good for me , because I use the bike to commute .
nothing I have done , but I am happy
It will be grate if I make friends with English amd Japanese speakers .
For example , let 's say you can not get any idea to write in your entry on Lang - 8 .
You talk to yourself , `` ah , I can write nothing on Lang - 8 today . `` And the explain of that you can write nothing affects you .
Something to write might occur to you if you kept on thinking for a while , but you become not to get any idea to write really due to your explaining , `` I can not `` .
If you observe yourself , you may find how you are affected by what you talk to yourself in everyday life .
being an english teacher
One is David from England and one is Chinese .
Of course , David is the teacher .
He 's helping that Chinese woman with her English because her English is not that good .
She needs to improve it , she says .
I learn English not because it 's used everywhere but I like it .
I like language learning .
I think I will write more if I have time and am in the right mood lol .
Last day in February
Today is the last day in February this year .
What do you think ?
We had already two months gone .
Do someone know good ways for me ?
I planned to go to Grand Canyon on the way to Japan this July .
But There are no available seats in the airplanes by which I can go to sightseeing around Las Vegas .
So I just transit at Las Vegas . . .
I will move to a new place so I quit English conversation school at the end of this month .
My last class was this Monday though , I had to go to my daughter 's cram school at that time .
I like my English teacher , Sean , and I sometimes wrote about him here .
His teaching style is so unique that I loved the way .
He always encouraged me and spoke to me after classes .
We enjoyed chatting in couple minutes .
When I listened to that , I was very happy .
I miss that I could n't attend the last class very much .
I wanted to express my thanks feelings , and I also wanted to say good bye .
If I know his e - mail address , I can contact with him though . . .
After I married , I 've repeated moving because of my husband 's business .
This is seven times .
People told me that I 'm lucky because I can live many places , and I can have the experience which people ca n't .
Of course , it is true but I 'm not an easy going person like that my friends think .
Moving sometimes works minus .
Sean and I could maintain good relationships if I did n't move .
I always have to cut good relationships by myself even if I do n't want to do that .
In this case , I cut two good relationships by myself .
One is my oil painting teacher , and the other is my English teacher .
I 've never returned back to here so I never meet them from now on .
I know that after painful separation , I will have good meeting .
Therefore , I will be optimistic , and I want to expect good meeting in a new place .
Few last days have been strange .
Since I 've came back home , I 'm feeling very lonely .
My mother and brother are in Italy , my father 's recently working almost whole day out of town and I can see him only for a while every day .
Friends I 'd like to see are all out of town too .
At first I thought it will be great to have so much time only for myself and my hobbies , but I gradually found out it 's not that easy .
Since I have so much time , I do things I 'd never expect myself to do at the beginning of summer holiday .
And I absolutely do n't know why am I doing such a thing , because I 've never been interested in it .
Tomorrow I 'm having a Japanese lesson after a long time .
I 'm very happy about it , also because my teacher is a very good friend .
First we saw the 8 pictures and guessed what this story is about .
And then we read this article .
What story do you image from these pictures ?
Two months has passed since I came here .
I am really learning a lot , but I sometimes wish the classes would be a bit more difficult so that I could learn more .
Today , I jammed with a british person in his house because his band lost the guitarist , so he was looking for one .
I was surprised how people here make friends .
Next month , I have nine days vacation .
I failed to get a Working Holiday Visa of UK . . .
It means that I can not work there and will have to go back Japan only 6 months because of a circumstance of my money , if I had gotten the appointment I could stay up to 2 years . . . .
It 's so tragedy for me .
I 'm feeling so blue despite in New Year . . . .
I have a dream I will be a teacher .
Or employer of little shop .
Thank you for you visiting and reading my massage !
I will try to write my diary in English for my learning .
But I ca n't write so difficult words and sentence .
I 'm not good at English , so please correct my mistake if you want .
I will be a university student and learning International science from Spring : )
Thanks a lot for all of your helps with my English studies , my friends : )
Fall in love
Actually it is just infatuation ! ! !
But I believe my intuition ! ! !
She is just new student at my school .
She is Korean , while I 'm Jpanese . . .
How can I manage this situation ?
1 to give up her .
2 to force her to go out with me
3 to study Korean language
A main difficulty is a difference of our languages . . .
How can I tell my feeling to her ! ! !
My imagination is still getting bigger ^ ^
In conclusion , self control and adaptation make a successful life .
When you walk on the road to your success , there are many temptations which prevent you from doing what you should do for your successful life .
Without self control , you will get sidetracked easily .
When you face to obstacles , you should apply an appropriate adaptation in order to move forward .
I do n't have good ears , so I had to listen to CD again and again in order to copy phrases and write it into music sheets .
It took long time to finish one song .
Now , I do n't need music sheet any more .
To enjoy my hobby more effectively , working preliminarily is required .
I bought a voice recorder that is called a linear PCM recorder .
This kind of recorder can record your voice and music at the same level or higher as CD 's .
My older one 's sound level was MP3 , so when I heard the recorded voices , I had to stand hearing cracking sounds .
BTW , I chose Sony , which has a good reputation of its beautiful sounds .
Japan is going on heat wave over 35 degrees everyday .
We have to be careful a heat injury like these days .
It 's important that we take water and salt as often as possible not to be the heat injury .
Espcially old people have the heat injury easily .
Japan is tighting a electric power because of accident of nuclear power plant by earthquake .
We have to try to save on electricity .
New Year 's EVe
I have 4 days long New Year holidays .
Good ~ I must organize the schedule for these 4 days long holidays well .
I am planning on going to Taipei 101 plaza to enjoy a fireworks show .
Although it is a little bit cliche as every year I always go there to see fireworks .
No idea what to write about , let 's just see if I 'm able to produce consistent English , at least on paper ( on monitor , you 'd rather say : ) ) .
Although I do n't like these commercialized sites that offer everything in the form of several easy steps , I have to admit that the vast and helpful community easily overcompensates it : )
As I noticed people like to break things into paragraphs here , sometimes having a dedicated one for each sentence .
This is my first diary on Lang - 8 .
So I slept 12hours !
Our bus run through vast steppe and I enjoyed panoramic views from there .
All animals I saw in Mongolia seemed confortable .
Each time when I memorize the earthquake , it always makes me painful , because the horrible scene that I experienced and saw from TV and DVDs often appears in my mind , and I can hardly forget people 's bloody face and incomplete body under the ruins .
Human being was so fragile in the face of nature disaster .
That earthquake changed me a lot , and it made me rethink of myself , how I should live and what the most important thing in my life is .
I think it 's necessary for me to write down what happened and what I experienced in the may , 2008 , because it will release something in my deep heart and I really need a release , and which have depressed me so long , and I must unload them now .
A couple of days ago , I discussed foods with my Filipino online tutor .
While we were discussing , our topic was changing to fast food .
So , when I spoke to him about MacDonald food , he shared me with a very scary video clip from YouTube .
However , natural french fries and a hamburger went rotten quickly , but on the other hand , MacDonald 's food 's rotten speed was very slow .
The most scariest stuff is MacDonald 's french fries .
I think that the guy is from my favorite documentary , `` Super Size Me `` .
I really think that there are lot of chemical stuff in MacDonald food .
However , I really think that it is not only MacDonald food , but also we can say quite the same things to another fast food .
However , I definitely need to think of where and what I eat .
This was after a decade since we finally met or talked on the phone .
He said , `` How are you doing ?
We 're very very long time no see . ``
I said , `` Oh , I 'm fine .
But he said , `` I moved to Osaka from Kyoto and I still work as a municipal employee .
Nothing have I problem .
I just remember you .
So I called you . ``
I felt slight strange , because he is married and he also has a child .
And He has not contacted me for a long time .
If I were him , I probably had not contacted former girl friend
just remenbered .
The line was somehow stuticky .
So I said to him `` Where are you now ?
He replied me `` Me ?
At the balcony of my apartment .
It 's windy day today . ``
Did n't he think about his wife and child 's feelings ?
I contacted a common friend of us but he said my former boy friend was OK .
I think , sometimes he acted childish behavor .
I belive he was into all along .
I 'll recover from lack of my sleep and prepare for tax return .
What is the dream of all of you ?
Today , I should present a general assembly of youth YMCA .
Frankly speaking , it is not so strict as we think , because the assembly is held by young students from 15 to 19 .
I 'm 20 years old , but I took a role that teach them what they should do in youth YMCA .
I 've been a member of youth YMCA since I was 14 years old ( in Korea ) .
But As I graduate from the highschool and go to a university , I 'll begin to be in activity in different place , and with different people and different way .
So this assembly maybe the last activity I do in this town .
Being a student I 'd been stuck in youth YMCA , the fact that I should leave there makes me miss it .
However , I 'll do best in this assembly , and deliver what I 'd felt while I had been a member of YMCA as I can .
I am also in great hope that I can experience a new things .
To Make English sentences
I started the practice to make English sentences .
The practice is to translate the simple Japanese sentence to English .
Elaborate pratical plans can give you a hand when you face difficults or feel depressed and help you get rid of unexpected
It 's really a bold and challenging plan so that most people around him did n't support this plan .
I went to community center this afternoon .
I have been singing a song once a month with chorus member .
All member are good people and half of them are retirement age .
I have enjoyed everytime .
Our repertory of songs are a few and our talent for singing is not so good .
But it is a good way to keep member 's relationship .
It is only once a month and so it is deifficult to improve each other .
Even enjoyable time is important .
But 24 is the drama which is in a little bit unusual situation and very difficult for me to listen to it .
Jack bouer always says `` What 's going on ! ! ! `` : ) .
Although , Ally McBeal is very usual situation and I love it , but I am male . . .

instead of drum set
the practice played during short break between school hours .
a bass drum part played step of my shoes by floor instead of bass drum .
a snare drum part played using pencil and desk instead of stick and snare drum .
I did n't play well , so I 've never been impressed others .
Specially , I would often played introductory passage of ' into the lens . '
The base guitar part of that tune synchronized rhythm of bass drum .
At the same time , the keyboard part of that tune synchronized rhythm of snare drum .
But , does n't make me excite much . . .
Today we hold meeting once a month .
I am Japanese high school student .
I become college student next year .
I want color my hair and have one 's ears pierced next year .
But I want courage to be it .
But I have enjoyment too !
I am finding the way to enlarge my learning process .
For me , Physics is consisted of complex concept and a lot of information .
To learn it well , I must memorize it with realization .
But I ca n't achieve that , as I am not good at memory .
I konw that I will lose my way if the situation continue .
Before that , I should find the solution first .
As we know , success will not come in a sudden .
I ca n't pay for the success without my effort .
Because there are meaningful that we have spare effort to strike our goals .
Now , I understand that it is interesting , so I can learn it easier than the past .
In fact , the word I write is to encourge myself for learning .
I do n't want to give up my study .
I have goals as everyone .
I very often use twitter in a day .
Usually I tweet about my thinking and news articles .
For example , I read news and if I felt it was interesting , I tweet its title and link .
Recently , I had become to read news on my iPhone usually .
Typing on the iPhone was bothering for me because my typing speed was very low .
So I did n't add my comments when I was read news via my iPhone .
However , my typing speed was improved dramatically because of training using an enjoyable application .

I 'm a senior student in Soochow University , I major in teaching Chinese as a foreign language and international trade .
Responding to an article ( ' Beautiful Things Work Better ' )
In response to the article ' Beautiful Things Work Better ' , being a teacher myself I could not agree more .
The years spent on desperate search for better techniques , the very practice of teaching with its amazing ups and sleepless downs has definitively proved that learning as such is to take place solely in favourable surroundings .
The point on which I could take issues with the author lies sooner in how to create the right environment for the language acquisition to happen , given each person is strikingly different .
The thing I feel strongly about is that it seems unfair to defy traditional education on the grounds that it fails to meet every student 's needs .
Nevertheless , if we dare take a closer look at creativity ( and what is learning if not a fascinating mixture of experimenting , forming , shaping , producing and the like ? ) then we have to admit that , in the long run , successfulness is not a bed of roses , albeit highly rewarded in the end .
Short stay in Seneagal
I will go Senegal for two months in this autumn .
Then I have to discuss with my host researcher .
My flight determined as previous attached file .
For the hotels , I want to ask one more thing .
Our company will give me money for hotel and air ticket but does n't give any other salary .

Most of the names of lands are Maori names and I found them sound quite familiar , being a Japanese native .
About half of the people I saw walking down the streets was Asian .
I just recorded CD .
I just had dinner and sat at desk .
I can feel chill in the morning early .

While I driving in car , I often used to listen music .
Have you heard Sting of musician ?
He 's like a fall .
or His voice is good match in the fall .
( I 'm not sure this sentense )
THe more and more I have good relationships with my friends , it is much harder to say good - bye to them .
Recently , my English teacher left Japan , and another teacher is leaving Japan soon .
I would have difficulty getting over this great sadness .
How does everyone get over the grief ?
I realized that if I am in love with a certain man , there will be when I have to say good - bye to the man .
Even if we love each other , or no matter how we attract each other . . .
I am confused by romance relationships recently .
How sad season it is ! ! !
I hate russian weather .
It 's March , but we 've just had a very thick snowfall .
Maybe it 's been even a blizzard .
Tonight , I went to the curry resutaurant with my friend .
There are some Indians only , but they can speak Japanese and we can communicate with them .
Keema curry and cheese nan tastes very good ! But the nan is thin and wide , so it gets cold in a minute .
And if you drink water After eating the nan , it absorbs water , and become bigger and bigger in your stomach .
Do you have a favorite Japanese food ? I recommend a Japanese food ' Tempra ' : )
This knife has very good quality , and is pretty handy as well .
On his way to the store a neighbor saw him with the knife and called the police immediately .
It is said adequate workout help you keeping your health .
I think walking is the easiest workout for almost everyone from young to old people .
The pedometer count your steps when you put on it automatically .
It is fun , even funner than expected .
I recommend that .
More than ten thousands steps a day is appreciate daily target to achieve .
To be positive is much more important thing than I 've thought .
The book also said that you must not say or even think `` I do n't - - - . `` That means that you must not focus on negative side of any stuffs .
For example , when you are afraid about something , do n't think `` I do n't have to be afraid . `` but instead you can think `` Relax ! ' or `` Enjoy . `` Actually I ca n't agree with this easily , but the point is the same thing Robert told me before .
If there is water half of a cup , how do you think ?

Removed a plaster
She broke a bone of her left arm two months ago .
I really love watching video clips which encourage me and motivate me .
According to the video clip , although she is 90 years old , she is still fine and has been keeping creating hand made violins .
I found a wonderful craftsmanship inside her .
Since I 'm not good at listening to the Arkansas accent , I ca n't understand what she is saying perfectly .
However , the reporter 's English sounds very clearly , and I can guess what she is talking from the reporter 's story .
Can you have maintained your motivation like her ?
After I watched it , I asked myself .
However , I sometimes loose interested in painting and learning English .
I know that in both painting and learning English , if I would love to master them , all I have to do is keep going .
However , it is the most difficult , and most of the people drop out in the midway .
In the video clip she looks brightening .
I really would love to be the foremost craftsman like her !
You knows she is a great singer .
Now my favorit song of hers is `` If I were a boy ``
But real boys do n't think deeply about their girl 's feeling .
I partly agree it .
Boys should think more and girls should effort to understand .
Everybody drank , ate a lot .
Changing the subject , I 'm exhausted today , because I had a lot of works , but everything went well .
It 's rainniing
Maybe the autumn has becomed .

I need to dress two clothes , but I feel comfortable .
In the store , autumn fashion start to show off ( sell ) , yet they 're expensive , I ca n't afford the purse , It will breake the bank .
In my opinion , It 's a rip - off .
I 'll buy the autumn fashion untill the price become cheaper ( the store give a discount )

Because I wish more and more people can appreciate my mother tongue .
For the past 5 months I had been watching a Mexican telenovela called Teresa .
She was mean , she lied to her friends , and said her mother was dead cause she was embarrased of her humble roots .
Plus , she dumped the rich guy and seduced his best friend , whom also happened to be her sister 's in law boyfriend .
So , in summary she was a tramp .
Anyways , this past Sunday the novela ended .
My family came to my house and we cooked carne asada we were all together to watch Teresa 's last chater , we were hoping her to end homeless and lonely ( like in the original version ) , but to our suprise she did 't .
It was so unfair , she kept the money and the guy .
So , what did she learn ?
What was message , be a tramp and you 'll suceed ?
So to end this entry I 'll just cite Teresa 's mom : Me das miedo Teresa . . .
3rd , Summit Global Japan reported they would start to sell instant film and instant camera of Poraloid in Japan in 2010 .
Polaroid faced financial crisys and it stopped selling instant film and instant camera .
I took many pictures by their camera and film .
I regretted that Poraloid stop selling thier photography products and think if I were richman , I would buy Polaroid company and continue to sell their products .
Fortunately there is another rich company and it revive Polaroid .
One of the most attractive point of Polaroid is that we can see photos just after we take them .
But now we are using digital camera to do that and running cost to see photos taken by digital camera is free while photos of Polaroid costs us film fee .
Even so Polaroid has unique attractive point such as exciting feeling when we see photos appearing on the film .

What I would like to be or what I have to do near future .
I 'm a positive thinking man so I 'll just do what to do .
Tomorrow can never fail to come so we have to be positive .
Which country slaughtered more ? Japan ? or German ?
The historian Chalmers Johnson has written that :
It may be pointless to try to establish which World War Two Axis aggressor , Germany or Japan , was the more brutal to the peoples it victimised .
It is surprising how western people are unaware of Japanese atrocities while they always compare Hitler to devil .
Moreover , it is Japanese that worship the war criminals in a temple specifically built for them .
As if that was n't enough , they changed their history text book deleting , removing many of their faults during the world war 2 .
Instead of admitting it , they 're justifying it saying that all we did was legitimate according to the international law .
Is it legitimate that abducting young ladies from countries like Korea , china and sexually abuse them in the war place ?
Difference between Germans and Japanese is that it seems like Japanese are not ashamed of what they did in the past while Germans are not only ashamed of what they did but also did not forget to apology to victimized country such as Poland .
Amazingly , in Japan , the prime minister has recently changed every year .
Anyway , we have already had four primeministers since Koizumi .
Japanese people are now expecting the new leader , and a new era .
Good - looking American play

I think it 's very important for me to have as many opportunities to talk to a native speaker or a person who can speak English fluently as possible in order to improve my speaking skills .
One of the opportunities is the lesson with a native speaker .
This lesson is held almost every Saturday .
The teacher is one of five ALTs ( ALT is the abbreviation of Assitant Language Teacher ) who work in public school .
This lesson is a quite precious opportunity for me .
That 's why it 's very hard to find them in my area .
The size of a lesson is so small that I can many chances to talk in English .
After talking , we do some things by using a text .
For example , we remember useful expressions , play a role play , and make sentences which contain new words .
Lastly , we read an article in newspaper and discuss it .
2 hours always flies fast .
I attended `` 76 meeting `` today .
Company presidents born in 1976 gather for it and 20 people came .
On the meeting , one makes a presentation about his company every time , this time I made it .
After that , we drunk together and had a fun .
There was a light snowfall yesterday at the neighborhoodof my home .
So far it has come winter .
I watched DVD `` Who killed the electric car ? `` ; this is a documentary film thta deals with the history of the electric car , mainly focused on The General Moters EVI .
This type of car was invented to reduce air pollution , the emission of carbon dioxide out of atmosphere about ten years ago .
When it was released at GM , it became sensational , but disappeared and `` Hammer `` was released instead .
This is said chiefly because the influence of Bush administration and oil company pushed out this environmentally friendly car .
Ten years later , now , we are conscious of how we can be `` green `` and President Obama are going to encourage the invention of this pug - in electric car .
The film is very impressive to know the situation in those days , and how strong policy and companies ' relations are to pursue each profit .
Second of all , I `` d like to study fashion design .
Japanese fashion school do n't teach fashion design .
They only teach how to make clothes beautifully like the way of sawing and making patterns .
I `` d like make my story deeply and study how to express the story to everyone with strong impression .
Therefore I started to study in foreign country .
last night , I do n't know what wrong .
I just ca n't sleep , I used too many way to help me sleep , but that 's ca n't help me .
Now , I am staying in school .

I know I ca n't do that , but I ca n't make me do n't sleep in the class .
It is close to the Christmas .

I watched the World Series last night and as most of you know , The Yankees won .
Most amazingly , Matsui hit remarkably and was chosen the MVP of this World Series .
Since he had been probably the most popular player in Japan before came to the US , many fans were shocked at his decision of leaving Japanese league .
However , most of the people are still rooting him as `` Matsui in the Yankees `` .
I was a fan , too , but last night he turned to just my foe .
In the interview of MVP , he said `` I feel like in a dream . `` That was a nightmare for Phillies fans including me .
Anyway , I enjoyed watching the Phillies ' games and I want thank all players !

I have confronted in need of to speak Elignsh in my office .
I study hard .
The very begining . . .
It 's hard to start the new diary , especially here .
It was a little bit borring .
We are just trying to carry out an interventional study with Juvenile delinquents ' whom are a group of 15 - 16 year olds according to the book `` EXPLORING FEELINGS : the Cognitive Behavior Therapy To Manage Anger `` , which was translated in Japanese .
Therefore I have contacted Dr / / / / / / , the author of the book , so that we would have some advice for the programing .
And with regard to the rating scale and scientific evaluation of the program ( to compare the program 's effect before and after ) , he suggested me to contact you and told your e - mail address .
We are planing to measure with the State - Trait Anger Expression Inventory - 2 ( Schwenkmezger et al .
1992 ) for the evaluation study , but also thinking that it would be a bit difficult for some of the subject group members .
That is why , it would be helpful , if you could give us some advice for the ebaluation of the research and provide the detals about the rating scales that were used in the book .
In my opinion , western youths have more freedom than their friends in Eastern .
In many cases , they have to earn money for not only their living but also their family : they become the main earners .
So sometimes they ca n't follow their dreams , instead they get jobs they do n't like , as long as it brings them much money .
A few people do n't give up but after several years , passion is not strong enough .
In other word , they sacrifice for their family .
Especially youths come from countrysides , they have already suffer dearths and not want their blings to do so .
Today , I 'm going to read law book after I has read lots of novels .
Now , I must go to read .
Byebye !
Yesterday 's My English Lesson
Yesterday my English conversation teacher Sean and I took a very interesting lesson .
He suggested me that tell a lie in English .
When I told a like , I was very nervous to trick him .
Because I had to make two stories which one is true and the other is false and I also had to told them in English with same facial express , voice tone and so on .
My stories are like that ; when I was a younger , I was a tomboy and most of my friends were boys .
I like playing games with them and one of my favorite games was making frog bombs .
It was that I stuffed fire crackers into alive frogs and throw away toward to people .
My mom was always upset to my behavior .
When I was three years old , one day I was looking at a washing machine and had curious about that .
While I was watching the movement , I do n't know why , but I wanted to try jump into the watching machine .
At the same time I recognized that I turn around with laundries .
All my hairs came out and of course , I heard my mom 's screaming .
On the other hand , when I was a younger , I wished to do pee with standing like my boys friends .
When I played with them , I always did pee with standing .
One day I tried to do pee with one of my boys friends from upstairs toward to my dad 's car .
We were standing on the balcony and did pee .
When my mom saw our pee downstairs , she was really mad to us .
Do you know which story ( turning around into washing machine or doing pee with standing ) is true ?
Of course , I do n't speak them in English though .
He gave me a copy of the song 's lyrics , but I just sing a begining of the song that `` I 'm dreaming of a White Christmas just like the ones I used to know . `` That 's all . . . .

It taste thick .
What Can We Do for Tohoku Region ?
Up to now , the death toll reaches at least fifteen thousand and ten thousand people are still missing .
According to TV news , there is still a lot of debris in devastated area .
That is , it is necessary to remove it immediately for revitalizing there .
Also , the region has a serious problem on education environment .
Because of the chain of disaster , the children in the region have not got enough education .
Therefore , since we have knowledge to teach them study to some extent , we will be able to provide the education with them .
What we can do is to buy as many products made in the region as we can .
At first , let me explain the SRI in detail .
However , in addition to the points , the factor of social contribution is being needed .
The former invest 100 yen per a cloth for Tohoku region .

So in the train , I do somethings like reading a book , listning the music and so on .
I was checking email , studying and then sleeping today .
In addition , I 'm also wring my journal !
I have started learning English at the age of 13 which was a junior high school student in Japan .
Since there was not many foreigners in my city at that time , I felt learning English was really fresh .
I graduated from university , at the same time , I quit studying English .
However , I restarted studying English for my better life since I do understood how English is important in the global society .
Both the reading passage and the lecturer in the listening part refer to a question that dinosaurs are warm - blooded reptiles or not .
The reading passage argues that dinosaurs are like today 's mammals and birds are warm - blooded animals , but the lecturer holds an opposite point of view and maintains this theory is not very persuasive .
He refutes what is cited in the reading passage that the fossil in South Dakota in 1993 is the evidence that can support that theory .
The lecturer 's second point is that dinosaurs do not have to adapt unstable climate as how snakes and lizards do today .
Contrary to what is mentioned in the reading passage that only warm - blooded animals can survive from the fickle temperature at that time , he opines that the weather at that time is relatively moderate than today 's , meaning that there is no extremely shift between high and low in temperature .
Besides , the fast - changing weather temperature was never been recorded .
Last but not the least , the lecturer contends that big body size do not necessarily mean that having a warmed - blood system .
He agrees with the opinion of the reading passage that giant body needs a constant body temperature ; however , he believes dinosaurs like big sea turtles have a low ration of surface to volume , which can reduce heat - losing , and that is able to keep them in a stable body temperature .
Recently , I often watch `` FRIENDS `` , American drama series .
Some magazines recomended FRIENDS for English learning .
Because , its wording is not so difficult and they speak natural English .
As a matter of fact , it is easier to listen to and understand what they say
than other dramas such as `` BONES `` ( in which there are too many technical terms ) .
And I enjoy it very much because the story itself is very funny .
But one problem , , ,
Jokes are sometimes very difficult , especially blue jokes .
They require us to have cultual backgrounds or unique vocabulary .
It reminds me of an episode .
a man told a joke but I only saw him blankly .
In the future , when I will be able to enjoy every jokes in FRIENDS ,
it 's the time I really acquire English skills .
I 'm aki
but English is very difficult for me ! !

From my perspective , I strongly disagree with the statement that the help from government is often not necessary since most people can solve their problems by themselves or with the help from their families .
On the contrary with the statement , I believe that even people may receive helps somewhere else , the helps from government , in some cases , is what citizens need most , because of government 's authorities and tremendous powers .
Besides , offering various helps is a government 's obligatoriness , no matter such help would be regarded as unnecessary or not .

Last night , I went to sushi bar with my coworkers and owner .
It was great time .
I learned many things from them .
In Japan , when you have a toast , you have to care about your situation .

She is very heart - warmed person .
But she is n't good at housework , especially washing dishes .
Yesterday a lot of used dishes were piled up at a kitchen and I could n't bear those left for a day .
So it urged me to wash dishes and I dealt them roughly with anger .
10 minutes later , my wife came across to me and showed me a white cup .
She told it was presented by her grandmother who was already dead .
My nummer holidays were to short , as usual ; - )
The reason why my school starts on Thuesday is , pupils with the grade 5 in their school reports can make a test about the whole last year to get in the next higher class .
I am learing Electronics with Informatics and Computertechniques .
The austrian schools are very univerally that we know from everything a little .
It consists many technical acknowledgements , but also subjects as German , English and Economy will be asked .
But that the hardest and the most fearsome test is the `` FTKL Project `` ( translated in english : Manufacturing and Construction Doctrine ) .
After passing all tests , I can decide to start working or go to an universaty .
But I think I will choose working , because I am already sick of studying > . <
Addionally , after 2 years work experience , I will get automatically the title `` Engineer `` .
I kind of thought that , as long as I write something in english , someone correct my english while sleeping .
but I guess thats too good to be true .
and thats kind of sad coz this is about interacting with real person .
I guess I have to take an action in order to find someone to correct my english ?
yeah let me find someone who needs my help .
someone who is studying japanese in this case ?
alright where are they ?
can I just say hello to them ?
or add them ?

My best friend is coming from Japan in a week .
She is the first person who visits me since I came to Australia .

She is now working the same bank as I was working .
However , the first day , she is just leaving Japan late in the evening and the last day , She needs to take an early flight so We have got three full days off .
I wonder if 3 days are enough .
So I was surprized at changing this site ! !
I 'm enjoying my summer horiday , but I have a lot things to do .

A Sad News
I received a very sad news from my friend in Tokyo .
According to her , one of our classmates in our painting school died because of a cancer .
Actually , I talked to her last month .
To be honest with you , I did n't like her because she was the person who said whatever was on her mind .
So , I was weak in her .
When I chatted with her last time , it was my first time to see her in six months .
I live in far from Tokyo , so I can not attend her funeral .
Latterly , I 've had a runny nose .
Sneeze seems to be my routine .
I always sneeze day and night .
In fact , I am allergic to cold air so every time , if someone switch on the AC , I will sneeze later .
A few days ago , I plucked the hair in my nose as it was too long .
Maybe , I assume that I hurt the cell of my noise wall .
The most exaggerated thing is that the tissue I used to blow my nose become moist towelette .
But I wonder if it can be cured with time .
When I was a secondary student , two teachers taught us English at the school .
Mainly , Japasene teacher taught English grammers , accents and various words .
Another teacher who came from English speaking country ( maybe The U .
I had never met a foreigner then , as I lived in a small town in Japan .
The Japanese teacher talked and talked to us in Japanese whole the class .
I did nothing but writing down what the teacher explained .
I 'd alweys like to have a pet at home .
My mother was very sceptic to this idea , but my father fullfilled my dream and bought me bautiful dog : ) I was very happy and I spent almost all the time with my Friend .
But one day my dog disapeard and I ca n't find him anywhere .
Now I miss to my Friend and look for him through the window every day . . .

maybe I use both here . . .
my major is English and American diplomacy & history .
I am going to go to the university of Georgia from this August .

I have been made to borrow a book from six books at once in all today after all .
All these are slightly severe there for two weeks .
But was the book which wants to all read .
I will congraturate starting next year .
I do n't like drinking very well but I say hello , he says let 's drink if you have a time .
Although I do n't like drinking , I like meeting the friends .
I 'll will cheer you on .
My name `` Galle `` is named from a beauty salon I go to .
I am a student at Japanese university .
But my English is bad especially about speaking , so I can have no word whenever I try to speak in English !
So , I want to study ' English of the moment ' in this website .

althougt I am not good at english actually , but I just want to try and to know what level I am .
I feel nervours because it is the first time I take it .
hope it will go well
I was met with my friend last night .
We didn ' meet for a long time .
My friend is working on bank and I am studying examination .
I was very nice to see her .
We were talking about many things .
She has been toughing to work but looking for something special .
Like her dreams in her mind .
Also I do my best to come true for my dreams .
I thought that dreams come true is difficult and need to hard effort .
I thought that I was read one of book at a library .
`` Dream is eating beads of sweat ( your effort ) , not a rainbow . ``
It 's easy enough to understand , and it 's quite entertaining to watch .
I hurt my boyfriend .
I could n't stand his attitude and I said to him really bad words through an email .
`` I know we have different valus and thoughts ,
but this is the worst person to ignore the question what you 're asking .
So I try to react no matter who I like or not .
But , you know , there 's a person like that never care of others .
It was about him but I never referred that because I just want him to
After sending this email I felt better , although he did n't reply anything .
In the evening I found that he had disappered .
I took around I found him in a book room , and he was arranged . ( We 're going to move another building nearby this month of 13th . ) I spoke to him , he seemed to get angry .
He seemed to be crying because I noticed that his eyes out .
I realized my words injured his mind . . .
I just wanted to notice my heart .
He was apparently got down and I proposed going to dinner .
We needed to talk each other yesterday .
If we misunderstand each other , that would lead us break up .
I talked to him my true feeling that I have felt these days .
I tried just to be honest and open my thoughts .
He was always care about what he did to me , and sometimes he felt sorry for me .
And he said to me , `` I was going to break with you , actually . `` Just jokking , but when I heard this , I realized that how bad thing I did for him .
What I was thinking for him was always my egoism , and when I saw his tears , I was really ashamed of myself .
When I broke friendship with a boy friend in college , he said to me , `` you 're always thinking about yourself .
This was one of the biggest depressed experience for my life and since then I tried to keep my mind about this .
Even if I loved him in word , I did n't trust him from hearts of my hearts .
I always want his reply , and reaction because I want to find out his thoughts , views and values .
This matter was bad things from one aspect , but somehow I 'm reliefed
to talk to him my thoughts .
I went to Fortunetelling last night with my friends .
And I got a nice information about my future .
Recently Japanese tend to say that It 's inconsiderable to having an event or festival or kinds of things .
I understand why they say but Do they understand It will make sufferers of earthquake facing even harder situation .
Self - censore an event makes economy decline .
Declined economy makes people unhappy including sufferers .
I ' m confused !
One of my friends asked me such a this question .
I thought it but I could n't find proper answer .
If you read my blog and please correct her answer instead of me .
Her question is meaning of the sentence as below and that sentence is correct or not .
This sentence is printed on her son 's T - suirts .
One day when her son 's English teacher watched that T - suirts , He took pictures it and he said it is so funny !
So my friend anxious about the meaning of that sentence , If it is including slung or bad meanings .
I tried to trancelate it but it 's a little bit complicated .
I ' m sorry to bother you .
Long time no come here ,
because my work was very busy .
And I started new blog in Japanese here .
Because I read them that was translated to Japanese several times , I can read them without a dictionary .
Study English
I 've been to USA for two months at three times .
I think I acquire it with lang - 8 .
I was a first car at signal on the right lane to make a turn right there .
Then , what happen was that the car on my left passed my car and turned right on red signal .
This car was on the middle lane at the time .
In the last semester , things got very messy .
I might not be able to keep my promise for the whole semester but I 'll try .
I might try to raise the number of entries per week after I get a decent knowledge of Spanish .
I did n't even have any time to think about procrastinating this one .
But as Flawless group from Britain 's got talent said , `` Chase the dream , no the competition . `` I just hope that I could make it , not necessarily before the end of the competition but it 'd be nice if it was accomplished for the graduation project .
I keep pushing myself to always be optimistic , but there are some moments when I find this a very hard thing to do , who does n't ? !
This quotation is the only thing that keeps me trying .
I hope it does the same thing for you too .
Fort cunning park and MacRitchie reservoir
Yesterday , my husband and I visited Fort cunning park and MacRitchie reservoir .
Both were beautiful nature parks , we had a good time there .
In the morning we started our walk from Fort cunning information centor to get a map .
It was a time to have lunch , so I went to Fort cunning club house there were some restaurants and bar .
Unfortunatelly , It was renovationing !
We loooked for other restaurants in a hurry and found it on the map .
At last we reached there .
That was a nice looking restauran on the hill around a beautiful forest t .
It was a colonial style ( singapore colonial house is called black and white ) , and founded in 1908 .
If the restaurant had not closed , we cought have a lunch in the teraace !
The resaurant was closed on every sunday !
We wanted to eat anything , anywhere so we had a lunch in a near macdonald ( my husband likes mac ) .
After lunch , we took a walk around the park .
I took many pictures in daze .
On the way , I happen to watch the traddditional malay wedding outside .
That was so wonderful !
We had time to go other place , we went MacRitchie reservoir near our house .
In the reservoir , we rented a canoue two people using the same .
We paddled the canoue there and it was a lot of fun !
The reservoir was in the forest , we felt exploring a jungle or something .
This is the first time since my mother went back home from the hospital .
Although we need to back home by six , my daughters enjoyed it with my parents .
We also visited the grave which my grand parents sleep .

All good people here .
Older brother is 4 years old , and younger 2 .
When my wife was pregnant , `` just like all the other husband and father `` I thougt everything is going to be beautiful just like on TV .
But , after 2 sons , What I imagined proved such an illusion .
Far from talking and eating around dinner table with my lovely family gracefully , I can hardly eat my meals to survive .
I bet anybody who has child ( especially more than 2 ) can understand exactly what I am saying now .
Reality is wholly diffrent from imagination .
Seeing me and wife playing loudly ( maybe my first child seemed to have thought we were quarreling ) , he said to me that `` Daddy !
I do n't want you to hurt mommy . `` T .
T He made my eyes water .
We have to learn children 's thoughtful consideration for others and frankness about it , because we know cosideration and frankness always work .
I like talk to another country 's poeple .
adding me : )
Believe that most of the people like playing online games .
I always want to find some online games to play .
However , it is not easy to find a game that is interesting or I 'm interested in it .
For now , I want to find some online games from the foreign countries .
But unfortunately , it is so difficult to find , even if I use the search engine such as yahoo and google .
So , can you introduce some interesting and exciting online games for me ?
I was sitting in a bus and watching the TV in the bus .

My favorite manga is Doragon Ball ,
I met my conversation partner ( student tutor ) named Amanda for the first time .
( She stood me up ! ) I thought that it could happen , because we set a time at the beginning of the last week .
For that reason , I really looked forward to seeing her .
On the first day , we did not work on any chapter of the textbook .
She did not bring it , because she thought it is more important to get to know each other .
It means she did not reach the legal drinking age yet .
I have a difficulty making long sentences and can not keep talking about one specific topic .
She also asked me to feel free to ask whatever I want to know .
She let me know her cell phone number and I did the same .
We set a future schedule and said good - bye to each other .
Last month , google was attacked from chinese servers .

I thought it is joke .
But it is not joke .
Perhaps , I will visit to Philippines a few months later .
That was the first time that I had ever seen the whole town had no electricity and got completely dark .
No electricity means that everything including traffic lights , streetlights , stations does n't work completely .

As you know , there are two kinds of way to study .
You will talk with your friends , you and your friends want to play outside , but there are n't any parents who will mortify about this things , therefore you may play outside and do n't study .
However , if we study alone , normally we study in our home , so there is n't any partner to talk , although we really want to play outside , there is n't enough friends to play , and your parents will mortify about this .
Some says : It 's healthier for the body to ether lay or sleep at the ground .

Unlike the commom university with more buildings and less plants , Changsha University is more beautiful than a garden .
Getting into the school gate , you will enjoy a feeling of backing to the nature .
Wandering on campus , green trees , colorful flowers and clear water catch your sight , plesant smell of flowers occupies your nose , and the suond of reading aloud and whispering of birds capcutures your ears .
What 's the better , the road is so clean that you almost ca n't find any rubbish , even a piece of waste paper .
What you feel is that , far away from the noise of downtown , studying and living in the university is more close to your heart , and the quiet environment also contributes to concerntrating your attention on study .

# This is an opinion writing .
I should first state my opinion , its supporting reasons , and then make it detailed with some exemplifications .
It demands me to write at least 300 words in 30 minutes .
It means I have to write ten words in a minute , and a word for six seconds .
At the conclusion I would like to see which person I am by observing what I have written , objectively .

Honestly , I worried about their newly married life .
She was poor at housework at one time because her mather took care of her so much .
I felt sorry , but his dish was betther than her . . .
Some foreigner tend to think that Japanese men don ` t keep house at all , and women work for their husbands devotely .
Some men doesn ` t do housework still now , but most of them help with household chores .
It ` s a few husband who do all af housekeeing like New Zealander , but more and more men began to be interested in their home .
Actually , one of my dad ` s hobby is pressing shirts with iron on Sunday .
It ` s not work but hobby for him .
Tnat ` s why , I want to insist for foreign women . `` Don ` t feel that it is worst to get merried with Japanese guy !
`` And it is for foreign men , `` Do not expect too much to get married with Japanese women . ``
if I get a job , I have no problem . .
I 'm really worried about get a job . .
I 'm looking out for learning to drawing .

I often get on the airplane for business trip .
When the airplane sways , Japanese CA always say `` We are going through a turbulence just now , but it ` s not problem about our flight ``
So , thire saying give me a more fear .
I think they shouldn ` t mention about flight detail !

A typhoon is going through Japan tonight , it comes with a very rough weather .
Very strong wind , very heavy rain , typhoon sometimes causes of floods , landslides , and some people are killed .

Therefore we went to the contact center in the station and the police station to ask if the purse was found .
Two hours later it was found , so we appreciated people who help us .
Then I went back to my hometown on 30th December .
I met some friends in recent days , and will go to Chiba tomorrow .
I would like to stay more at my hometown , but I 'll start to work on 4th January .
I wanna work near my hometown someday .
I 'm not good at English , but I want the friend in the foreign country .
today are my favorite singer debut ten years old .
Eventually English class finished today . . .
I think the term of 1 month was very short , but it was very lucky to meet a good teacher .
He is from Chile but he had lived in America from his youth life .
Through the efforts of him , I could improve my English communication skill a little bit than the past time 's .
For instance , when the class started , he always said to us one question , `` What happened yesterday ? `` .
When I got his question at first class , I could not answer about it well .
Of course I had my intentions so I wished to say to him but I could not answer at all .
But as days go by , I could gradually adapt to his question .
So if I have my intentions now , I can brainstrom ideas and tell anything .
Although it is not yet perfect but I feel my skills exactly upgrade .
Anyway I feel so sad with parting from him . . .
I only have good memories and leave . . .
and I think I will be not able to meet like him again in the hard world .
It will be very precious memories to me . . . , so I hope to get them until dead . . .
addios . . .

Although I feel a bit bad , and dissapointed of me because I 've decided be more responsable with my homework and I did n't do it .
In both presentation , I did n't effort for get a good note , because I know that I could do it better but I did n't , but also I did n't recived the support of my team .
If I was lazy , they were lazier than me .
That 's why I 've learn that I got to work harder , if my team do n't do anything , I got to do it because the note is important , and I guess that got to be individual .
At the other hand , I felt very amazed about some clasmates , they did a wonderful job , I felt envy of them because I 'd love to do it at the same way or better .
But I promise the next time I 'll effort and I wo n't trust in my teammates .
