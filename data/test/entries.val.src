And he took in my favor ite sub j e c t like so c c er .
A c t u ally , who let me know about L an g - 8 was him .
H is Ka n j i ' s ability is much better than me .
We ' ve know n each other for only half a year , but his less on was a l ot of f un .
I heard a sen t ence last night when I watch ed T V .
When you go down h i ll , you have to st ic k out your ch est or you will f e ll down .
When you go up h i ll , you h v a e to be n d your back .
It is like when you are con f ro n ted with f r ust r ation , you have to keep your con f id ence .
When you are go s m o o th ly , you have to be more mo d est .
When I was at school , we pai n ted a l ot of w o o d en hand ic r a f t s like small p l ate s and case s .
The ma k ing so u ve n ir is a hard and interest ing work .
Well , f in ally , my mother took me to the c ust o m s w in d ow , she ga ve a pass p or t to man . . .
That ' s two b a ll s : one with a c at inside , other with do g .
You know , you can take them at s l ot machi ne .
The th ir d me m or y is the house we live d .
It was sit u at ed near He l s in k i , big and light house with the small la ke behind it ( it was w in ter , so it was f ro z en ) .
D o n ' t know why .
I like d the w in ter F in l and .
And I ho pe I like the s um m er F in l and .
J ust im p ro v is e already ! `` To tell the tru th , I myself did n ' t expect what I C A N play like that I did .
If only I had black de n se c ur tain s .
A co up le of week s a g o , I heard a new W h it ne y H ous t on ' s t un e on my c ar ra d i o .
I had been wonder ing what she was do ing .
It said that was dis a p po in ting .
O l d and not beautiful . . . . .
I know her t um ul t u ous mar ri age with B o b b y B r ow n and an ar d u ous b at t le with dr u g a d d i ction .
S t i ll she has n ' t re c o ver ed from them ?
M or e dis a p po in ting thing to me is she said the reason of her bad voice was because she talk ed with O p r a h W in f re y too much on her show .
That might be one of the reason s , however , it sound s like just an ex c us e .
I would say after 1 0 year s of wait ing , it has not f a il ed it s ti t le , at least from my first impress ion .
A n y way , I think I ' ll sp ent quite some play ing it in the next f e w week s .
O K , let ' s all for my first ent ry .
B e f or e , I went to a l i b r ar y .
On the way I had a head a ch e .
So , I think if we have to go some where on f o ot , we must put our ha t .
If we did n ' t that and walk for long time , we will co ll a p se or di e .
If my sen t ence s are n ' t p r a c t ical c or re c t them .
This morning I found out that one of my f a v o ur ite b and re le as ed his new al b um .
I already for g ot about R is e A g a in st an it is a great surprise for me , because I did n ' t return to them for 2 year s .
I ho pe this b and did n ' t become w or se yet like many other s big one s and I ' ll enjoy listen ing it .
Well , there re m a in s to get it and c he c k it out .
It ' s because my m um is probab ly the be st c ook I have me t in my life .
C ook ing is not her pro f es s ion , she is a house w if e .
I have at e at hotel s and ex p en s ive me al s but they are nothing like what she c ook s .
I rather be work ing outside than be a house w if e .
I think it ' s about for one and half year .
I should have ex p l o d ed who le this bu il d ing so that I can make them de st ro y ~ ! ! !
I had to write about co un se ling .
This is my first time to write di ar y on the in ter ne t .
I ho pe some on e see my di ar y and c or re c t it .
I watch ed D V D `` G re y ' s an at o m y `` to day .
A c t u ally I keep watch ing it the se days .
So there are a l ot to see .
I do n ' t know me d ical w or d in English very much .
But I can study English through this .
And I think it ' s f un , right ?
And I ' m eat ing a b an an a every day for my he al th .
The b an an a is ga ther in my st o m a ch and give s me en er g y .
I have to make a new s p a p er in English as my s um m er va c ation home w or k and I de c id ed to in t ro d u ce about my do g on the new s paper .
I will in t ro d u ce about my do g , T i ar a .
She is c he er ful and p l um p pretty do g , per ha p s she is the c ut est do g in the world .
She ' s a go l d en re t ri ever and she ' s 8 year s old .
He r f ur is beautiful am b er and so f t .
She is little st up id , but has per c ept ive in s i g h t s about f o o d because she is always f a m ish ed ^ ^ She l o ve s f o o d !
When she is b as k ing she look s very co m f or t able .
however , I ho p ed ra in because it is too hot .
I saw a new s on Ya h o o yesterday .
It re p or ted that C h i en - M ing W an g c ut his ha ir and had a new ha ir style .
He re is the l in k .
It talk ed about there is a big di f f er ence about different va l u es of a hand s ome man between We s ter n co un t ri es and E aster n co un t ri es .
It me n tion ed many ex amp le s of J a p an e se me n , K or e an me n and H on g K on g me n .
They pai d much at te m tion to their face s and also sp ent l ot s of money to sh op .
But in We s ter n co un t ri es , the stand ar d of a hand s ome man depend s not on their face s , but on their ma s c u line s y m b o l s , say , m us c le and be ha v i or .
I started to not ic e the way s of for e i g n c l o th ing and ha ir style s the se past days by watch ing T V pro g r a m s , such as F ri en d s , S r c u b s and e t c .
If they had a long ha ir , it will be re ally long and th ic k .
B y con t r a st , me n in e aster n co un t ri es most dress up .
E x c ept a shirt and a j e an , we usual ly we ar an access or y .
As to ha ir , me n usual ly have a me d i an ha ir , neither very short or long .
If we want to c ut a very short ha ir , we must leave some ha ir on the back of ne c k in or d er to a v o id look ing like a n er d .
It almost co st a who le morning .
I have to watch the N B A f in al game 3 .
I like you give me any co m m e t s and op in o in s too .
I re ally like to dis c us s .
My so n have di ar r he a
When I came back home from work ing to day .
It was like a w ar ter and so n ' s hi p became re d .
To m or r ow I will go to home t ow n .
We are read y to go out .
But we c ance i that .
But a no way .
I am listen ing to m us ic with the co m m ut er train .
To day , I listen the m us ic , it look s like in the c a f e .
I like w ar m sea s on .
so I like sp r ing .
S p r ing is very ex c it ing sea s on .
J a p an e se school , work start s sp r ing .
I ho pe to get any qu ar if ic ation s in e ng l ish .
I ho pe to get my new pro m o tion s .

S in ce to day , I ' m going to try write a di ar y ! !
To day is nothing sp e c al to write ! !
It ' s kind of T a i - w an stay le ma s s age .
I l o v ed the ma s s age sh op where I went because the s ta f f of the sh op explain s what is wrong in my body .
A fter that , I went to a f it t ness c l u b which has be d r ock bath ing .
I feel re la x to take a be d r ock bath ^ ^
I ' m went to S en d a i to business tri p to day .
The sp e c i al pro d u c t in S en d a i is a co w to n gue .
I b ough t it and at e at home .
I want to eat it s co w to n gue again .
The d aught er was w o k en up by my w if e .
The w if e was w o k en up by my s ter t or .
Where to do it and when we should leave is not de c id ed yet !
So , even now I feel n er v ous , wonder ing if It ' re ally going to be he l d .
And I want to live my life on my own p a ce .
B e c a us e when I finish ed my class es , home w or k s or job s e t c . . .
It ' s near ly 1 0 p m when I back home .
It ' s near l ly 1 2 p m .
The se days I s u f f er ed many un ha p p y things .
M a y b e those matter s were not so bad as the fact s , but I re ally could ' t hand le them while they o c c ur ed to g e ther . . . .
I do n ' t know how to m aster this language well . . .
T h ough I sp en d most of my time and en er g y in le ar n ing English , it see m s that I hard ly make any im p ro ve ment has become a tru th . . .
I do n ' t know why I have to le ar n English so hard . . ! ! !
our teacher said a sen t ence to me , which made me heart b ro k en . .
I had never knew my English was poor unti l the teacher told me that my English was sound i ll o g ic ally . . . .
S um m er ho l i day
I had long b re a k time .
I should to study again .
I ' m got up at thirty past 6 a m in J a p an .
He ll o ! N ic e to me e t you ! My name is A il s a .
I ho pe you make many friend s of the la ng - 8 .
than k you every on e !
E le ction will be done A u g st 3 0 .
M a y er is c he er ing H a m ad a mi n is ter of de f ence .
H a m ad a b ir on g to L i b er al D e m o c r at ic P ar ty .
This time they may be los t a d o m in is t r ation .
D e m o c r at ic P ar ty has more many s up p or ter s than them .
M a y er is bu s y with e le ction c amp a i g n and his own work .
I ' m going to do every ting for help him as his se c re ta ry .
I went to Ka n a z a w a un ive r s ity f est i v al with my A m er ic an friend .
I made good friend with V i e t n ame se .
we enjoy ed well .
And we had a dinner with my another friend s .
It ' s a am a z ing day to day .
It is made of sp ng e : ) It is c ut e .
I ' ve receiv ed the accept ance letter and s ch o l ar s h i p de c is ion from the B er k le e C o ll e g e of M us ic .
I ' ll ent er the B er k le e in the f a ll se m est er this year .
But I have two w or ri es .
One of them is that my English is very c l um s y yet .
A no ther is high - p ri c ed t u i tion .
A n y way , I ' m study ing English at the T O E F L In st it ut e the se days .
The B er k le e do n ' t require s a T O E F L s c or e .
M an y as s i g n ment s are give n to me every day .
It ' s very difficult to do all of them , but I always try to make ma x im um effort s .
I ' m la er n ing English , but it ' s re ally difficult for me !
S ever al days a g o , I got an ir re g ul ar heart b e at for the first time in my life !
It was like this ; I s ud d en ly started to feel a kind of dis c o m f or t around my heart .
I was very s c ar y because I had been very he al th y so far .
I ' m still in the 2 0 ' s .
D o I have to get along with it all my life ? ``
The do c t or told me that I did have a ir re g ul ar p ul se o s s a c ion ally but it was not a f at al one .
He a d d ed that it could get w or se d u e to str es s and f at i gue , and he just a d v is ed me to take an enough re st .
I was re le a v ed to he ar the do c t or ' s di a g no s is but I ' m still w or ri ed .
I think that may be a co m m on question for those students want to p ur s u e a high er education .
What C h in e se un ive r s it ies off er for their students are most ly comp o s ed by course w or k b a se c ur ri c ul um .
I ' ve s um up some point s which I think im p or t ant and us e ful .
You can co un t on go o g le as your be st friend , a d v is er and an almost in f in ite re s o ur ce s of a c ad e m ic paper s .
M an y of them you can down l o ad p d f copy , or If you c a n ' t down l o ad paper from the l in k s s ch o l ar . go o g le . co m off er you , go direct ly to the a u th or ' s we b s ite , many a u th or s enjoy their paper to be seemed and cited by p ot ent i al read er s .
A good re v i e w is the be st start point .
And then you can tra ce the a u th or , or the paper cited to do a more in de p th re se ar ch in your interest ed are a .
The b al ance of w id th and de p th of your read ing is es s ent i al .
B o th way have it s me ri t s and dis ad v ant age s .
I no v at ive and original idea is good , but if you can not find them , you should know that most of re se ar ch work is just re f in e ment of other ' s work .
I ' ll sp en d the next week s on board of the `` J ust o S i er r a `` ve s s el ma k ing some g e op h y s ical re se ar ch and le ar n ing .
B ad thing , I have n ' t le ar n ed the ve s s el ' s part s in English yet .
The thing that I want to make in J an u ar y 2 0 0 9 is to in ve st more effort in study ing English and keep on writing sen t ence s in English every day here , L an g - 8 !
However there were not so many people there , so we do not need to wait our turn outside .
I think that M an g a is the great ent er tain ment c ul ture from J a p an .
My favor ite write r s are N a o k i U r as a w a ( The M on s ter , 2 0 st c ent ur y bo y and more ) and H i ro y a O ku ( G ant z ) .
B y the way , I found some we b sit es that there are hu g e am o un t of M an g as that tra n s la ted in English .
( I think no do u b t about il le g al . )
It ' s a new ex pe ri ence and very education al of English .
But , I think that there are a l ot of difficult express ion s in M an g as in English .
D i a g no s ed of being easily impress ed
I re al i z ed that I ' m that kind of people who are easily impress ed .
I ' m mo v ed by very simple things and other people might not even have a second look at .
F or in st ance , I started watch ing In d i an mo v ies about a month a g o .
When I had the time , I brought about six In d i an mo v ies to watch .
The first mo v i e I watch ed , made me c ry for two hour s like a five year old who los t her do ll .
A c t u ally all the In d i an mo v ies have the same b as ic idea .
However , I con t in u ed c ry ing d ur ing the re st five and each one of them impress ed me even more .
In d i an mo v ies are like c la y that you can sha pe into many different sha pe s but they ' re all still made of c la y .
This conc ept might be a b it am b i g u ous for those who have n ' t been in such sit u ation .
I took a me d ic in e , so I feel better for now .
`` 4 5 0 th time s ``
This is my 4 5 0 th time s di ar y .
I started keep ing a di ar y around the 2 0 0 8 .
T h an k s to the people all over the world , I ' m having a f un time and so l id time .
C ha ng ing the sub j e c t , I got my call from my friend yesterday .
I re c ent ly out of sha pe . `` I was somewhat p u z z i ed for an answer .
He ll o ! My name is K en .
I ' m study of English was started .
However , it is ter ri ble and difficult .
The no ve l is about a im p or t ant ro man po l it ic an called C a i us M ar i us .
He is de ma in character , al th ough appear ing other s like C or n el i us S il la , M e t el us , and the C a es ar ' s gr and f a ther .
M ar i us did n ' t come from a im p or t ant family , but he became in con s ul because he was a c l ever and p op ul ar g en er al at ro man ar m y .
So , after he was ch o se con s ul by the ro man s , he went to A f ri k a where he f ough t again t Y u g ur ta who was k ing of N um id i a .
M ar i us w on the w ar in two year s , and when he went back to R ome he was ch o se con s ul again d ur ing five year s .
M ar i us had to f ri g h t other tri b es at no r th of I ta ly , unti l in 1 0 0 B .
he must leave the p ow er because he got sick .
I l o ve study .
B y the way , D o you like study ?
I ' ve just receiv ed a in ter n ation al call by my ce ll p h on e .
I was wonder ing if that was from my friend ' s call .
But that ' s from K or e a ' s qu ar ant in e de po t ,
We do n ' t have this s y m p t o m s now .
If that help s , this picture is the i nformation what ga ve us from J a p an ' s qu ar ant in e de po t when we return ed J a p an .
is every on e free ?
let s ha ng out with me in to k y o ~ ha ha ~ x D
im so o free ti ll next month .
c a z I don have a school unti l it ! !
I don like it .
A l th ough most people think about what ha p p i ness is like , most people never do u b t there are ha p p i ness some where in hu man ' s life .
A f a m ous man , I heard , said in the past that the w or st things for you is to be b or n in the world .
This is my n ic k n ame .
I st ud i ed a p p l i ed p h y s ic s and electronic s at a un ive r s ity in Tokyo .
I took a b a ch el or ' s de g re e of the se sub j e c t s at the un ive r s ity .
I change d job s a f e w time s but the same ty pe of job as an e ng in e er .
I still work for an electronic s make r in J a p an as an e ng in e er .
My p ar ent s and a brother and a s is ter live in Tokyo .
F u ku o k a is l o c at ed the no r ther n part of K y us h u .
K y us he is a part of the J a p an e se A r ch i pe la g o .
C o m p ar ing with Tokyo , F u ku o k a is comp a c t but it is a very co m f or t able c ity .
C o m m o d ity p ri ce s here are l ow er than those in Tokyo and F u ku o k a A ir p or t is very near c ent r al F u ku o k a .
You know , N ar it a A ir p or t is far from c ent r al Tokyo .
M or e o ver Tokyo is a very c r ow d ed c ity .
One thing I un s at is f y to live here is that I ' m se p ar at ed from my family .
It take s much money to go see my p ar ent s from here .
English less on for H a ll ow e en
I ' m an e le ment ar y school teacher as you might know .
In J a p an , start ing next year we ' ll off ic i ally have to tea ch English to students who are in both 5 th gra d e and 6 th gra d e .
I ' ve made some English class es , act u ally .
The less on ' s to p ic was H a ll ow e en .
We provide d some kind s act i v it ies to get the students not only to keep enjoy ing the less on but also to keep some v o c a b ul ar y in mind before they know it .
One of them is `` H a ll ow e en tri v i as and B ing o `` .
The st ud ent need to answer some question s about H a ll ow e en I ' ve p re p ar ed by play ing B ing o .
The more c or re c t ly they answer , the more B ing o they can get .
A fter the class , I asked the students to answer a question n a i re .
I was very glad to find they like d the less on .
One of my ul t im ate go al as an English teacher is that all students look the world b ro ad ly .
I ' m sure you ' ll have p l ent y of op p or t un it ies not only to co m m un ic ate people from other co un t ri es but also to know s ever al c ul t ur al di f f er ence s through the less on .
I believe this will le ad them to accept ing more things .
That ' s why I ' m very ex cited with teaching st ud en s English ! !
It is c l o ud y or ra in y re c ent ly .
A l th ough my school was no le c ture , I got up e ar ly in the morning to day .
It co st six do ll ar s to was h ing and co st six do ll ar s to the dr y er .
When I was h ing end ed , it was even ing .
I went to the c a ke sh op in the c ity my friend in t ro d u c ed to me as n ic e ta s te and f a m ous .
The sh op of in n er de c or at ing was gr e en .
A fter came back home , I c ook ed dinner , and the dinner was p r a w n & a v o c ad o s al ad , ro a st ch ic k en and O T A M A S A N G O H A N .
F ir st , c ut let t u ce , c ut co ar se ly a to m at o and then s ta ir - f ly some p r a w n s .
The O T A M A S A N G O H A N is J a p an e se on ly tra d i tion al f o o d .
It only sp r in k le s the ra w e g g and a p in ch of the so y so ur ce on w ar m ri ce .
They were easy c ook ing but they ta st ed n ic e ! !
A fter that I watch ed two mo v i e , an im ation of g en i us bo y and 0 0 7 , on T V for a p p ro x im ate ly four hour .
I a p p re c i ate to tea ch English to my d aught er .
I was look ing for English class around here .
We thought just tak ing a tri al less on , but she told me that I want to go to the less on again .
I am very surprise d to her pro g re s s .
No w she is very interest ed in speak ing English , writing al p ha b e t s and s ing s W H A T ' S Y O U R N A M E ?
He r pro g re s s ow e to you .
It will be b a se after she will go to new school .
If I did n ' t need to take care of my kid s , I want ed to have your less on s !
It is very easy to come with kid s because it is c le an , s a f e , just a 1 - hour time di f f er ence and a v a il able H an ed a a ir p or t .
A fter class es of un ive r s ity , I went back home direct ly , p re p ar ed pack age s and sea r ch ed what time I should leave home and which train s I should take .
And if the tea m w in 8 game s , the tea m will get first position .
But re m a in d er of it s game s is 9 game s .
There f or e it is so difficult for it to get first position .
The start ing p i th i er was not good , so that the op po s i tion could get 3 point s easily .
We c he er ed very hard , but the mi r a c le was never happen ed .
T h o se are play ing sp or t s , read ing a b ook , l i th en ing to m us ic , tak ing a walk and so on .
My favor it ho b b y is talk ing with my friend s , because I think it is the be st time to be with my friend s .
I ga in ed about 1 0 k il o g r a m s after I qu it ted my c l u b s in high school .
That ' s why I have to los e my we i g h t ! ! !
So , I j o g and ex er c is e always .
I w an n a have the six - pack ! ! ha ha

We friend s h i p s for more than 1 0 year s .

To day is J a p an e se N ation al ho l i day .
So I took three - day week en d .
But B e c a us e of being ra in y yesterday to to day , I and my family could n ' t enjoy .

And re al i z ed how language could help you know more people .

She is teacher for walk ing and po s ture .
We had small talk ( short talk ? ) there , and left .
When I started to walk , I thought I want to talk with her more !
So I shout ed her name and stop p ed her .
We ex change our con ta c t in f o and de c id ed to me e t again very soon .
We me t two week s a g o , I felt strange , because we did n ' t me e t each other for many year s , but we have many things to tell each other .
P l ent y of things to talk , but not enough time .
We should n ' t so r t people into le ve l , but I believe we are living in same le ve l ( same c ate g or y , same world ) .
I do n ' t like watch ing a close s c re en so I k il led time read ing something .
To day , I read `` The catch er in the ry e `` as a s um m er home w or k .
To say the tru th , I could not understand why this b ook is thought a m aster p i e ce .
B e c a us e I did n ' t feel b or ed when I was read ing it , but I was not so ex cited or mo v ed .
If you had read the b ook , please tell me which part you think interest ing .

But it ' s co m m on for we J a p an e se .
We think that having trouble other s is very bad thing and sh ame ful .
E ver y p ar ent want their ch il d re n not to have trouble other s .
J a p an e se have gr ow n ri ce which need to help each other in the co m m un ity the past .
I ' d be glad if you c or re c t my mistake s .

I en ro ll ed the school in this A p ri l .
H ar d home work is require d some time s , but it is funny to get new know led g e and thought .
In the business , I cha ll e ng e a ta s k that I have not ever done .
this is also very va l u able for me .
With o ut f a il where there ' s great need , great heart s and mind s ri se up to me e t the cha ll e ng e .
T w o mouth la ter , my p rofessor will take some students to O h i o un ive r s ity in A m er ic a for a month .
But who want s to go there , he must pass the ex a m and the in ter v i e w .
G o ing a b ro ad is my dr e a m , so I re ally c he ri ch this op p or t un ity .
It is a good ch ance to str e ng th en my know led g e , board en my ho ri z on , and enjoy the for e i g n c ust o m s , and also re al i z e my dr e a m .
With o ut any mean s , what I can do now is to im p ro ve my poor English , speak ing more , listen ing more and read ing more and so on .
In my opinion , it is a difficult pro ce s s to over c ome myself , but I must insist on and keep on ma k ing it , what ever how difficult it is .
On ce you make up your mind , so per s ever e in do ing it .
I was s up ri s ed when I found it . I have been study English for 2 y e ar s . B e c a us e I want to make a l ot of friend s all over the world .

On the other side of the world , a great number of people live in less than 1 do ll ar .
A p p ar ent ly , the world is l op s id ed .
A ll of a s ud d en , I am wonder ing how many of us believe we know what ' s going on outside , watch ing l ot s of new s as C N N or N e w Y or k T im es play out .
I ' m bu il d ing an al g or i th m of comp ut er pro g r a m even when I have a dr e a m in the night , because I ' m do ing comp ut er pro g r a m all day long .

You can le ar n a l ot of things , like how to us e a kind of p en , and me e t a l ot of people , even they are not always very kind .

On ce you get into the so c i e ty , your life w on ' ' t be s im i p le as that in co ll e g e .

A fter left S e o ul , I did n ' t us e the on - line st or es .
I could n ' t believe the me th o d of cha r g ing .
B e c a us e it was much simple than K or e a me th o d .

My e le ve n month s old so n could stand by himself for the first time to day !

He might be s c ar y that he was stand ing without any help .
My e ng l ish is very be d .
I ' m to know nothing about gra m m ar , and I ' m afraid to speak e ng l ish .
In fact , I want to say much something , but write e ng l ish very tired .
He ll o ! I ' m sorry to l ate di a ly ; (
To day , I had sleep ed only two hour s .
So I feel sleep ing all day .
Why I still up l ate , because I watch ed l ad ies so c c er game ! The game was J a p an called `` N ad es h i k o J a p an `` v s A m er ic a .
The half game was s c or e less dr ow , the second half was dr ow .
E x t r a game was dr ow too ! I was very str a in ed by P K ! I ' m afraid of watch ing P K .

Yes , it is my bo s s ' s one .
I than k my e ar for my s ur v i v al unti l now .
So many M M A fight er s thought I want to be more strong er than I thought .
This is the most ne ce s s ity thing for them but my opinion is de f f r ent from them .
Even if they are strong but they some time s co un l d n ' t w in .
B e c a us e M M A is sp or t s but they should n ' t think M M A is sp or t s .
There are a fight er s who do n ' t think M M A is not sp or t s and if they see m s to los e the fight s they are going to try to k i ll their comp e t it or and so that some time s the strong los t by the we a k .
I want to say is no future in just only the strong .
F ed or who is Russian , I think he is the one of them .
He is called the one of the be st fight er in the world .

I had a dinner at 1 1 p m yesterday and s l ept down as soon .
I did n ' t feel that before s ever al year s , I did same things .

Yes ter day I got up l ate as usual , and then had l un ch , went to s up er m a ke t with my good friend , and b ough t something to my family .
Yes ter day was a bu z y day , but very ha p p y .
I feel the time past f aster than usual .

I did n ` t write here for a long time because I find a job .
It was very difficult work because we have to f a g over time .

D ur ing the last s um m er va c ation , I tra ve led around As i a ; M e la k a & K L ( M al a y s i a ) , S i e m R e a p ( C a m b o s i a ) , and B a g an ( My a m m er ) .

It is old c ust o m to make it in J a p an al th ough only ch il d re n do it in the se day . .
U s u ally ti t is hung under the ro o f , but I could ' n t do it .
E ver y on e who j o in ed this class were very good .
Even mi d le age man was better than me !
I am begin n er .
I made mistake s a l ot .
H y s ter ic ally , I am a well p l an n ed person so there are always full of s ch ed ul es that keep me from anything sp on ta ne ous .
So to speak , there are certain things I have to do almost every day before the s un set s off such as read ing a b ook , watch ing new s , and writing anything .
I ro n ic ally , I find it enjoy ing ha ng ing out with my friend who came here e ar ly morning , tak ing a who le day from me , do ing something st up id such as k il ling f l ies , ma k ing me think what is more im p or t ant .
I am very str es s ful ~ now .
It is very difficult to say anything . .
so , I said English with wrong w or d s . .
It was the k ing d er g ar d an le ve l ~ ~ . .
When I talk , I for g e t what I say , ,
G r a m m er was also wrong . .
I only say that `` I like ~ I want . . ``
very simple things . .
I felt very tired .
It ' s very l o ve ly .
It look s like some j e w el ri es .
I thought there were about a hu n d r ed th ous and people at the gr ound s .
I had never see n such a many people , so I was very surprise d : ) .
B y the way , what do you like to do in s um m er ?
P le se tell me : D
Yes ter day , I went to H ome D e po to bu y a b a g of so il and a p l ant er .

I do n ' t like le an ing English in school by two year s a g o .
But , I became like to English because I began think ing by myself .

Yes ter day , I went to the sh op p ing ma ll called `` D es s er t H i ll s `` and I found a l ot of reason able c l o th es , b a g s , sh o es and so on .

I c ar ry it any where , and show it to my friend s .
I de c id ed that I man age it as care ful ly not to b re a k .
Some time s , When I get back from co ll e g e , I feel that I can do a b s o l ut e ly nothing but watch ing a mo v i e .
I feel so ex ha ust ed but I can not sleep because If I s l ept then when I w a ke up , I ' ll have to start study ing again or going to co ll e g e .

I am going to mo ve out to S a it a m a ( Ka n t o are a ) from here just because I study at the un ive r s ity in S a it a m a .
I ' m very worry about the ra d i ation .
We do n ' t know when the sit u ation re c o ver per f e c t ly .
The w or st thing in the world is sit ting in a room with only your p en and watch the time go away
P re y for me : D : D
R e ad ing B ook s in a bath
My p re c i ous time is the time when I read b ook s tak ing a bath !
I usual ly take a bath more than half an hour .
I think know ing other s ' l o ve affair does n ' t make any sen se for me .
I like the st or ies which can not be expect ed and be like a ro ll er
I thought e ar th qu a ke is coming when I was h my face in the morning .
I ' m so n er v ous at e ar th qu a ke .
I made an e m er g en c y b a g in case .
And I have to f i x my f ur n i ture s to stop s l i p p ing .
It is very n ic e .
We walk ed around the ga r d en , we saw the an im al s and different s tree s ; we had a s m o ll l un ch

I think I ' m a la z y person , so I ten d to ch o o se an easy way .
I want to do many things for one day .
On the other hand , I think I sp en d too many hour s to us e a comp ut er .
It is f un indeed , but it is was te time for me .
If I quite c he c k ing sit es so many of ten , I think I can s a ve my time more .
I need to re c on s id er about how to us e a time .
T h ough I ' m not good at us ing a time at all , I want to try to be good at us ing a time .
I must make a good s ch ed ul e which I never give up on it way to .
I want to have more strong mind to keep my s ch ed ul e , and I want to con t ro l a time , not time con t ro l me .
H i every on e it ' s been a while since I w ro te the last di ar y here .
On F ri day I was S c re a m and on S at ur day I was a b l on d ha ir girl .
It re m in d me high school f est i v al .
What I found through c l u b ing as a girl is some guy s are so dis g ust ing ! !
E s pe c i ally one guy who try to dance with me was so dis g ust ing ! !
He was get ting too close and to u ch my as s with his le g even I ' m a man .
The c l u b has some small st age s and I was da n c ing on it then a guy came to dance with me .
A fter 5 or 1 0 minute s dance , at last he not ic ed I ' m a man .
He was like ' O M G ! ! ' n hold his head .

I was ted too much time on watch ing You t u b e .

A n interest ing T V show was a ir ed last S at ur day .
One of them is dr in k ing al ch o le outside , because most co un t ri es do n ' t see m to be all ow ed to dr in k .

D ur ing that sea s on , no one pay much at ten tion even we are dr un k , make no is e .
The next moment we rather become friend s with other gr o up s enjoy ing over there .
In J a p an , strange c ust o m is re m a in ed as for ha n a m i .
When we have ha n a m i , we have to get place before start ing .

To day , my country is ra in y .

So he will try to study about something in that his time .
But he has no idea that he should study about .
J a p an e se e c on o m y is so bad now .
We are conc er n ed about when we los e our job .
If he los t his c ur r ent ly job , he would n ' t know what he should do .
No w , W i i my house .

To day , I was very free .
So , I thought that what to do .
Then , I re m e m b er ed very im p or t ant thing .
My room is so me s s y because I was bu s y re c ent ly .
So , I c le n ed my room very hard .
I was too tired .
T `` is cha ll an g e time .
It ' s easy for me to study it .

P le a se l en d me a p en to write ( with / on ) .

A ll I want to know is that why they could n ' t come to my c al s s .
I asked some on e about why they were not here .
He ex p l an ed the reason in S w a h il i , so I was n ' t able to understand , but I re al i z ed that they were in under the punishment .
D o you re m e m b er my j o ur n al which I w ro te 2 days a g o ?
To day ' s c al s s is the same class which I was n ' t able to tea ch them because of C H O T A M A J I .
T an z an i an students are di f f er from K or e an students .
When I was in K or e a , if we s k i p p ed the c al s s because of other affair s , they seemed very ha p p y .
However , in here , my students do n ' t want to s k i p the c al s s .
When ever I have a class at night ( act u ally , some time s we have an ex t r a class at night like to day ) , I was sat is f i ed of my students who listen ed de v o ur ing every w or d .
So I have to d u g my first M P 3 ( 1 G B ) out from my draw er .
Well , it can not sat is f i ed me .
And I f a ll in l o ve with the l i b er ar y in our school ! ! !
I always stay there for a long time all day .
B y the way , listen to m us ic there is also a good ch o ic e ~ ( ha , ha )
D o you take a n a p ?
I us ed to lie down on the so f a after finish ing it .
R e c ent ly I read a b ook about the di g es tion .
A c or d ing to this , tak ing a n a p is not good for di g es tion .
It re c ome n d s us that even if we are sleep y after l un ch , we should not sleep ,
and if we get very sleep y , we should go for a walk to for g e t our sleep ness .
F in ally I de c id ed to p r a c t ic e it .
A fter l un ch of to day , I brought the b ook to the so f a and began to read it .
But two hour s la ter I found I had been sleep ing unti l that time .
I went to sleep after all to day too .
I wonder I will be able to stay up tomorrow .
My s is ter took entrance ex a m s a f e w days a g o , and she ' s wait ing her re s ul t s .
My brother will take it in this F ri day .
My s is ter is un ive r s ity , my brother is high school .
F ir st , I can see some mo ve ment s of people s to re c o ver from the da m age now .
When the e ar th qu a ke had happen ed , the e c on o m ic act i v ity was de p re s s ed strong ly .
We thought that it was not good to have a sat is f i ed days when people in the da m age d are a were s u f f er ed .
A l th ough that , we have already re al i z ed that the s ta g n ant e c on o m y was more bad for the re c o ver y of To h o ku are a .
F or in st ance , the us age s of the are a con ta m in at ed by the n u c le ar en er g y are now dis c us s ed on J a p an e se new s p a p er s f re qu ent ly .
I ho pe J a p an will re c o ver from this sit u ation and re p ly other co un t ri es for their help s in the future .
J p an e se en er g y po l ic y
B y the great big e ar th qu a ke in M ar ch 1 1 , J a p an e se en er g y po l ic y has change d dr a st ic ally .
M an y people claim that `` we should not us e n u c le ar p ow er p l ant ! !
`` It ' s tru e that ra d i ation po ll ut e people or ve g e t able s , so il , a ir and sea more or less .
However , I do n ' t think that n u c le ar p ow er p l ant should stop im m ed i ate ly .
B e c a us e if we c a n ' t us e e le c t ri c ity full y , e le c t ri c ity fee will in c re a se and some c or p or ation de c id e their fact or y to mo ve for e i g n country .
Then , J a p an e se e m p l o y ment will face great big difficult y .
M o st of J a p an e se people c a n ' t speak English .
So if we los e our e m p l o y er , we c a n ' t have job !
A fter that , we change our e le c t ri c ity s ous e to natural one .
We do n ' t have to change our en er g y po l ic y if we c a n ' t do that s a f e ly .
This is the thing which of ten J a p an e se w ive s say `` W h i ch is im p or t ant I ' am or your work ! `` .
It ' s same question .
Y e t she always answer wrong at the same question s that I had t aught s ever al time s , like ne g at ive number m ul t i p ly by ne g at ive number is po s it ive number .
She just c as u ally answered the question s and so r t of appeared im p at i ent , which made me so r t of a ng ry .
Y e t I has re f le c ted on myself of my be ha v i or back home .
I heard that before but I ' ve never play ed it and every one over there neither .
A fter having a be er po ng , many people play ed with it but a funny thing happen ed on that day .
T w o guy s were comp le ting against each other for run n ing in an a th l etic game .
B o th of them does not know how to run in the game ex a c t ly .
One of the guy tri es to run by l if ting up his k ne es a l ot and the other s are not .
A c t u ally , it require s l if ting up their k ne es high er enough to make K in e c t sen s er to sen se their mo ve , so he was c or re c t and keep the f a st est sp e ed in the ra ce .
However , the pro ble m is he is a b it too serious so he started mo v ing to w ar d the T V mo n it or little by little , then f in ally he s l i p p ed on a floor and f e ll down .
As the re s ul t , s ud d en ly he became 7 th in the ra ce which is the second from last .
So , the ra ce turn s out re ally funny one since one guy f e ll down and the other guy run s his s l ow p a ce .
It re s ul ted in get ting 7 th and 8 th .
E ver y on e started laugh ing and I was feel ing like a do c u ment ar y of a ra ce with a guy who did n ' t give up even though he f e ll down in a middle of the ra ce and a guy who keep s run n ing s l ow ly but never give up .
B e care ful d ur ing run n ing even though it ' s a game .
^ ^ It see m s nothing , but very re al ha p p i ness to me .
A t the same time , I want to get how to say no g ent ly because I want to have much ha p p i er moment than sleep ing in the morning !
I ' m their old er s is ter .
I do n ' t know what g if t s p re p ar ed my p ar ent s .
In the even ing we will n a ve a little part y with b ar b e qu e .
And of course there will be some our friend s with their kid s .
U W mean s U n ive r s ity of W ash ing t on , which l o c ate s in a beautiful c ity who se name is S e at t le .
B e f or e I went to school this morning , I sp ent one hour j o g g ing around a big lack which is G re en L a ke near my ne i g h b or h o o d .

I M is s You In L on el i ness
We live in the world for reason s , some of us live only to live up with their p ar ent s and so on .
I am no one of them , but I also mi s s some on e with heart and so ul when I feel l on e ly .
The first one come s to my mind is my gr and m a .
My mother s u ic id ed her s el f when I was only a b a b y b or n one year and since my father work ed far far away in the town , I was brought up by G r and m a .
As a ch il d , being n aught y , I brought about a l ot trouble to G r and m a , some time s I even b ro k en her heart .
E ver y time I go home , she always say s that : `` O h , my so n !
You are so th in and more than ever ! `` And then make s good dis he s for me .
That ' s G r and m a , in who se heart , I am always a ch il d .
Then I think of my father .
A bout 7 year s old , I went to a p ri m ar y school in the town and live d with my father in his school .
G r and m a made me a hu man and F a ther made me a person .
He always en c o ur age s me that I am the be st one in the world , if only I can hold on , I can get what ever I want .
In my 1 6 s , I did a l ot of bad things , but they never a b and on me .
So here I want to tell you how much I l o ve .
There are far less to ur is t s than S a i p an or G u a m .
There is no sh op p ing ma ll , no d ut y free st or es but full of nature s .
You may feel b or ed if you like mo d er n c it ies but I l o ve there .
A c t u ally I have tra ve led there e le ve n time s !
I think the o ce an of R ot a is most beautiful in the world .
L o c al people are very friend ly and we can be friend s quick ly .
E ver y time I come to R ot a , they say me `` we l c ome back ! `` .
They invite me B B Q , p ic n ic and hu n ting ! !
This time , they took me to a co c on ut c r a b hu n ting .
It was re ally ex c it ing ex pe ri ence .
C o c on ut c r a b is act ive at night so we went to a co c on ut for est at night .
It eat s co c on ut , so it ' s f la v or of co c on ut .
It is sure ly of ten see n that there is a big di f f er ence between idea l and re al ity .
Some time , such a time when you will have to accept something hard or b it ter might be coming in your life .
No w I ' ve been in the bo t t o m of my life never ex pe ri ence d before .
I will try to make the ga p between my idea l and re al ity short , but it ' s not going well l ate ly even in a small matter .
W h o can change your s el f is only you .
I am y u u .
I ' m the big in n er who just began L an g - 8 .
My he ir is not black .
because , It does co l or ing : )
I will have str e ng th en ed m us c le for sp r ing va c ation
To day ' s we a ther was ra in .
I went to the g y m which N e y a g a w a c ity run so that I can str e ng h th en m us c le .
M a y b e , I do n ' t have much m us c le than g en er al me n .
So I str e ng th en m us c le .
And then , I went to L ow s on which is con ve n i ence st or e so that I can work at there at 5 p m .
It s work was easy to day , because to day ' s we ther was ra in .
That is to say , when the we a ther is ra in , people are re l u c t ant to go out .
I was up se t last night , so I went out for fresh a ir .
My bo y f ri en d of ten con d e m n ed me to be against him .
So I try not to op po se his suggest ion , but I felt it us e less .
No matter how much I make an effort , he never change s his mind .
This made me hu r t , so I went for a walk for a while but he te x tm a il ed me ' You do n ' t have to come back !
T u es day , J an u ar y 4 2 0 1 1
F o l d ed e g g make care ful , comp le tion .
My s is ter make e g g .
So , comp le tion e g g .
C o m p le tion even as , mo m come in house .
M o m b at an e y el id .
M o m we make eat , de l ic i ous .
I ' m bad at me m or ies .
I went to a re st a ur ant with my friend who is one of my friend in my s w im m ing school last F ri day .
A t first we s w a m in the class , after that , we went out .
We did n ' t de c id e where we should go , but a co a ch thought me good re st a ur ant .
The re st a ur ant was near my friend ' s house .
I asked her if she know there .
She answered `` I do n ' t know ! `` There f or e we looked for it and we easily found it .
She said `` I knew it !
You and I came here once before !
You brought me to this re st a ur ant ! `` I re m e m b er ed it .
I am st up id , but my friend too !
And people see m s as if they were con st i p at ed ( this w or d is funny because in sp an ish `` con st i p ad o `` is `` co l d `` , and it ' s e as s y mistake the mean ing x D ) .
But I ' ve been ha p p y , and soon I ' ve see n a teacher that was ha p p y too .
A no ther new : I ' ve finish ed my s c ul p ture !
However , if I do n ' t get enough sleep , I will feel de p re s s ed .
On S un day , there are no act i v it ies and no p l an s .
It is suppose d to be a good time to sleep long er .
I ' ve been think ing why I want to study English .
I will ar r an g e it in English then write down here as soon as possible .
I have a feel ing that it is different from every body .
But every body has a something reason why they want to study second la un g u age .
E ver y body has different reason s , I think .
I feel ha p p y now for get ting my answer .
I want to study hard for explain ing my answer .
To day ' s work was end .
In sub st ant i ally , my s um m er ho l i day started from to day .
I took day off for a week .
What a ha p p y am I : - )
I ' ll go to tri p K y us h u J a p an next mo n day .
I c a n ' t wait mo n day ! ! !
I re m e m b er that I could not sleep at night before ex c ur s ion when I was ch il d .
My father was once a D J in c l u b when his you th , he got many L P re c or d s and C D s .
So I could come into can ta c t with many M us ic from B i ll b o ar d to C la s s ic .
A c t u ally I was tru ly b less ed one .
C a us e You may know or may not know , My father ' s g en er ation was a b s o l ut e ly poor .
E ver y th ing was comp le te ly de st ro y ed includ ing M us ic .
But there was U S A r m ed F or ce s in K or e a , and they ra d i o b ro ad c a st th i er so ng s mean ing B i ll b o ar d .
My father listen ed those so ng s from the ra d i o every day and re c or d ed it ( I ll e g al the se days . . . ) and dr e ame d his future .
Even though he could n ' t eat his f i ll , but he was ha p p y f il ling with m us ic s .
He sp ent all of his money to bu y the re c or d s or g u it ar .
A n y way s , I got his b l o o d in my ve in , I re ally into the m us ic also .
B o th of E m o tion ally and P h y s ic ally .
T h o se re c or d s when he b ough t his you th , now it ' s re al va l u able stuff s : )
My English s k i ll is not well .
H i , this is the first sen t ence I write here , la ng 8 .
I ' ve been think ing what kind of to p ic would be good , and then I ' m writing this va g r ant sen t ence s .
B e f or e I went to L on d on , I almost c a n ' t speak English and my English is w or th than an a ver age of J a p an e se .
But I got im p ro ve my English while I was in L on d on .
I know read ing and writing is not so good yet , and this is the one of reason why I de c id ed to write this sen t ence as well .
A n y way , I a p p re c i ate you to have read this a kind of letter .
To day is the good day , and I ' m go n n a go to S T A R B U C K S to get a co f f e e or something .
What W o ul d You D o When You ' re U n d er S t re s s ?
The se days , I ' m str es s ed out for my work .
T h ough I like to be ha ve myself , it ' s not easy to take con t ro l over my sen s it ive character .
I think that I ' m easily p is s ed off regard ing ti n y things re c ent ly .
If I keep going , before long , I might be know n for a p ic k y woman among st co ll e a gue s .
A n y way , I l is ted up my s te p s to re d u ce the str es s as you can see the be l ow .
E at ing sweet ies
P la y ing some m us ic in st r u ment s
H aving a con ver s ation with friend s and family
The simple way is eat ing sweet ies .
But I ' m afraid to get we i g h t .
What a s ad if I get a ch u b b y because of the str es s .
If I had no sweet ies d ur ing hard work , I would s u f f er from st o m a ch a ch e because the more str es s I have , the more ga st ri c a c id my st o m a ch se c re te .
S t i ll I had no idea which one is more better between ga in ing we i g h t and a ch ing st o m a ch .
It ' s a catch - 2 2 sit u ation for me .
S pe a k ing of f al ling as le e p , it ' s the be st for me to re d u ce the str es s .
N ever th e less , it is not f e as i ble to take it d u e to time - con st r a in t s .
: ( D es p er ate ly , I need to sea r ch for al ter n at ive s to co pe with the str es s .
I ' m ha p p y to he ar about it .
I was got ten a old la p t op P C from my mother last month because my mother b ough t a new P C .
So I in st al led a new O S called `` U b un t u `` , which is a l in u x dis t ri b u tion and free , to be f a st the run n ing than for m er one .
The P C us ing U b un t u is run n ing well as if it is a new P C !
And I am writing this ent ry on it with he ar ing a m us ic .
M a y b e , M ic ro s o f t may have any c ri s is ! ?
G o ing to tra n s l ate my b l o g
I de c id ed to tra n s l ate my tra ve l b l o g in two e ng l ish .
F ir st I will im p ro ve my s k i ll ' s in e ng l ish and second I ' ll have b l o g in e ng l ish .
B e c a us e last time , people of ten as k s me , if I have b l o g .
I re p la y , `` Yes I have , but in r us s ion `` , so I think it ' s time to c re ate an e ng l ish ver s ion .
I am a co ll e age st ud ent .
I live in C h on g q ing .
To day is a sp e a c il day .
D r u g ' s name is difficult to pro no un ce .
U s u ally , can English n at ive speak er pro no un ce difficult dr u g name
F or in st ance , when you saw a ar t ic le on to day ' s new s p a p er about this dr u g ,
can you pro no un ce them at a first g l ance without con s ul ting a di ction ar y or we b s ite , e t c . ?
B y ch ance , you can pro no un ce them c or re c t ly only from the al p ha b e t ?
In J a p an e se case , we can not pro no un ce some Ka n j i .
My so n has left for A ust r al i a last night .
I did n ' t know whether he w or ri ed about or looked for w or d to , but I ho pe that it will be sp e c i al and wonder ful ex pe ri ence for him .
I p r a c t ic e for ma k ing st or ies with some w or d s and p h r as es that I st ud i ed to day .
I made a story , to day .
I w o n ' t accept that .
To day , I went to school .
O ur teacher was a ng ry because re c ent ly many people b r ing on many ch o c o l ate s , a ce ll ul ar p h on e and all that .
But I never b r ing on them .
So I am sh ut of .
But my teacher said `` If you find person with many ch o c o l ate s , a ce ll ul ar p h on e and all that , you must w ar n ing to the person .
If you turn a b l in d e y e to , you are t ant a m o un t of the person . `` But I was un c on v in c ed .
B e c a us e I think that those people do not listen w ar n ing .
I am always we ar ing a p ed ome ter .
E ver y day , I look for w ar d to re c or d the dis t ance walk ed .
My w if e was h ed it without know ing the p ed ome ter in the pocket .
Even before , she a c c id ent ally was h ed i P O D in a pocket and i P o d did n ' t work .
My w if e said `` You are wrong le aving something in the pocket .
I said `` You are bad to was h without c he c k ing nothing in the pocket . ``
I will take English ex a m at J un e 1 2 th .
This ex a m in ation name is `` E I K E N `` .
E I K E N is p op ul ar English ex a m for J a p an e se people .
I think that E I K E N ex a m is made by J a p an e se people for comp ul s or y education al st ud ent .
O f cause , usual a d ul t s are able to take ex a m .
However , unti l E I K E N is somewhat re p la c ed by T O E I C .
M a y b e , T O E I C ex a m in ation is normal English ex a m in ation all over the world .
I feel difficult T O E I C more than E I K E N .
and then , I will take E I K E N ex a m .
I just c a n ' t stop s ne e z ing to day because of he y f ever ( + _ + ) I take a me d ic in e every morning , but it does n ' t work the se days .
To day , I have ra n about 5 k m along the ri ver .

A ccord ing to bra in s c i ence , J o g g ing have effect to be ri ch s er ot on in .
L a st S un day , I went to k a m a k ur a .

On j un e , many A j is a i come into b l o o m in Ka m a k ur a .
M an y pe p le visit there .
Ka m a k ur a walk ing is go o f at m o s p he re .
I went to P i an o comp e t i tion with ho st family .
O l d er ho st brother got a second p ri z e !
I think that comp e t i tion was big .
It ' s the sp r ing dr i z z le , so I ' ll walk to we t through it . . . ?
I heard some on e on T V said `` It ' s the sp r ing dr i z z le , so I will walk to we t through it `` .
I have a mar a th on to day .
I do n ' t like run n ing in the ra in very much certain ly .
That is why I said the w or d s a b o ve .
U m m , o k a y , o k a y , It is just a sp r ing dr i z z le , I will run to we t through it !
Then , I b ough t not e P C at B i g C ame r a .
So , I write this di ar y w h it it ! !
It was very di f f ic ul e t that I set up this P C .
I will p r a c t ic e it !
Even though I say it myself , I ' m us ing some so a p s that do n ' t con tain c he m ical sub st ance s .
I heard that some de ter g ent s can be ha r m ful l when they are dr a in ed to the ri ver or o ce an , re n d er ing l o c al people un able to a v o id some da ng er from the po ll u tion .
F ro m the look of it , e c o - conc i ous might be the watch w or d from year s to come .
yesterday I and in s o m n i a , mind is all the me s s of things !
In or d er to dr in k , I f in is ed my work e ar ly .
I dr an k with co w or k er s days after a long se p ar ation .
B e c a us e one of the man was on leave of a b s ence from work , we could n ' t me e t with us .
But I was re f le c t that I could do something for him more .
M a y b e if I could listen to his affair he might be not on leave of it .
I went to the c l im b ing g y m .
I could c l im b to day more than last time because my hi p ' s hu r t was get ting better .
I felt that he al th is the most im p or t ant thing for hu man .
I can have been tired , never th e less , I went to the c l im b ing g y m .
I thought that I ' m ha p p y to go to the c l im b ing g y m .
B e c a us e I could me e t to my friend s who se I want ed to me e t .
A J a p an e se f a m ous c l im b er Y u j i made many cha ll e ng es in there .
I tri ed some new cha ll e ng es but they were so difficult for me .
A fter all , I could n ' t do c l im b ing at le ve l five of cha ll e ng e .
I could n ' t speak English too much .
I went to dr in k ing with No b u after w or d .
A th i e f open ed his g y ve by a not e and k il led himself by his sh o e la ce
A n off ic i al on be h al f of the police st ation said to the me d i as that he k il led himself by his sh o e la ce after open ing his g y ve by a not e in hand .
I ' m glad to see the off ic i al became so im a g in at ive .
I ' m not ir ri t able so much but I ga in ed 6 k g since then and some time s I w an n a eat f o o d s that I do n ' t take before .
It ' s a little s c ar ed .
So I ' ll try to find things I like more and I have to go on a di e t !
It see m s to have been very hard day to day for me all day long .
It was just because I was very g l o o m y un c on s c i ous ly .
I do n ' t know e ll the reason why I was very an n y o ing about everything .
W as it just because I have l ot s of less on s .
I got out of te m p er to my friend s as much as I felt for ry for her .
She show s me de e p understand ing , because we are ve st friend .
B e ing the school will be off tomorrow , I ' ll take a re st co m f or t ably at home .
If some on e is b l o at ing too much .
You are ex a g g er at ing too over .
I am in w u h an now

I ' ve heard that The United States in t ro d u c ed a s y s te m that ra ting teacher ' s
what the most interest ing I thought is that this s y s te m as se s se s teachers with students s c or e .
I do n ' t think students s c or e could be the stand ar d for est a b il ish ment .
F or ex amp le , va ri t ies of teaching me th o d s and ma ter i al s should be in v o l v ed in c ri ter ion for est im ation .
A f er n begin s to gr ow on the str u c ture name d pro th a ll us , which is gr e en and who se sha pe is similar to heart mar k , and a f er n will b r ing up through a l ot of comp le x even t s .
G en er ally speak ing , a `` w ar a b i `` is un e at able , but it s you ng s te m is eat able if you c ook c or re c t ly .
When I had a b as is c he c k up - up at the comp an y ,
I was told to go to a ho s p it al to have a c he c k - up again .
The re a ul t of a re ch e c k - up was also a ne m i a .
I have to give the ir on by in j e ction 2 0 time s for a treat ment
It will be t ough to me ! ! !
I have been stay ing at my p ar ent s ' - in - law ' s house in the se three days to sp en d our new year ' s days with them .

I still do n ' t know how to us e this we b s ite , which is very comp le x for me to understand the s y s te m .
I ' ve just come back J a p an from B o st on and N Y .
I visit ed s ever al c l i ent s d ur ing the day time and we went to re st a ur ant s and b ar at night .
I want to do a hu n d r ed of things .
It is some time s hard because of my poor English ; however they are tru ly good ex pe ri ence s * B y the way , I mo v ed in the new house last S at ur day .
A c t u ally , this was the f if th mo v ing . . .

The house is very n ic e because it is c ut e and c le an ! !

It is going to start 1 st F e b .
My English friend now is stay ing at my house in J a p an as home st a y .
Besides that I have intention to le ar n D an ish , which will be six th language I know .
In ter d is c i p l in ar ity , p r a c t ical st ud ies , wide ch o ic e of course s , ex pe ri ment al spirit and open - mind ed ness are cause s why I am so ent h us i a st ic about R U .
This is a p en c il sh ar p en er .
So c ut e !
I ' ve been le ar n ing English for about 9 year s with 4 year s of bra ke , but I ' ve never had con ta c t with people who speak English , so I think that in my future po st s you will find l ot s of po l ish in f l u ence .
My idea for a life , I think , is make all dr e a m s come tru e do ing everything what I can at the moment .
I ha te living in one place and do ing the s ame every day .
My f a v o ur ite sub j e c t s are ma th s and p h is ic , so probab ly I can have pro ble m with con ne c t they with tra ve ling or something like that .
But last time I heard about cha r ity or g an i z ation s which need ing e en er s and it can be a n ic e idea .
I D e p ar ted N A R I T A a ir p or t at 1 1 : 3 0 to go to S ing a po re .
but I ` m tired be a c us e di f f er ence in te m p er a ture between S ing a po re and J a p an .
I s l ept long time yesterday night .
S ing a po re d ur ing in R a in y sea s on s .
I ` m look ing for w ar d to school start ing = )
I am p r a c t ic ing writing the comp o s i tion s to im p ro ve my writing ability for the G E P T ex a m in ation . - - - - - - - - -
If you are study ing , you would n ` t w ant some on e to both er you .
L a st night , J en n y was study ing for t est .
If I were an an im al , I would be c at ! !
A c t u a ly , I l o ve c at !
When a c at say `` my a o ~ `` , I f o ll in l o ve with the c at .
If I can be a c at , I will go out for a walk who le a day , sleep unti l I feel good , be along with people when I l on ly .
I finish ed read ing a b ook of the second , `` A S er ies of U n f or t un ate Even t s `` in English .
C o m p ar ed to first b ook , second one is more compli c at ed .
I would l o ve to finish read ing it in this three days .
As soon as I saw that , I found it was a w al n ut .
And it was de v id ed and rolled on the l o ad .
S ud d en ly something had been f ly ing for the w al n ut .
And I not ic ed that this c r ow d ropped the w al n ut from his be a k to gr ound in o d er to b re a k that she ll .
The c r ow must understand the ex is t of gra v ity which we have ' t understand yet .
On my bu s y days , It was a time I felt ha p p y .
A s um m er co l d
No w a day s whether is so hot !
O ut s id e is like a s te ame r and inside is very co l d because of the a ir c on d i tion er .
M a y b e you think I make absurd remark s , but I m sick and tired of an
How ri d ic ul ous it is ! !
T ur n on an a ir condition er in mo d er ation is a be st way we can .
R e c ent ly , I watch ed ' G r an To ri no ' direct ed and star r ed by C l in t E a st w o o d on T V .
I think this f il m is one of the be st f il m s of C l in t E a st w o o d .
There was a kind of le c ture about his m us ic care er .
He play ed the con t r a b as s and the g u it er .
H is m us ic is play ed in the end of G r an T ri no .
I am at my first year of un ive r s ity and I ' m c ur r ent ly study ing English and J a p an e se as ma in sub j e c t s .
I ' ve always l o v ed le ar n ing new language s , and the se are the one s that I de f in ite ly like the most .
I re ally enjoy le ar n ing new w or d s a d express ion s , and when I do n ' t know the right way to say something or the right w or d for something you ' ll litera l ly see me run n ing to w ar d s the di ction ar y and gra b b ing it as soon as I can !
As far as J a p an e se is conc er n ed , It ' s always at t r a c ted me in a way and so , since my town has one of the be st language in s it ut es in I ta ly ( can you say that about a un ive r s ity ? I do n ' t know . . ) I ' ve de c id ed to study this cha r m ing language .
S in ce the s um m er va c an tion start , I always stay up to play comp ut er game and even get up unti l A M 1 3 : 0 0 .
Besides , little ex er c is e make me ga in f at , so I want go g y m and go on a di e t .
This ti t le come s from my favor ite so ng s un g by G re en day , one of U S b and .
As they said , It ' s es s ent i al for you to know your e ne m y which make s you in a trouble .
As for me , To day ' s my e ne m y is unti d y f at around my st o m a ch !
F e w week s a g o , I went to A ust r al i a for sight se e ing .
The tra ve l was very enjoy able , but I at e high - c al or i e me al s many time s d ur ing my tri p .
( In particular , on the p la ne for A ust r al i a f light c re w s kind ly serve d me with me al s five time s )
A fter I came back to J a p an , my we i g h t in c re as ed by more three k g before I left for .
And I have n ' t change trouble s ome part of my body yet .
It e m p ha s i z ed it ' s im p or t ant that the c al or i e you con s um e must be high or e qu i v al ent against that you take in .
That ' s why I de c id ed to eat l ow - c al or i e f o o d s and to go j o g g ing every day .
Then there ' re good thing and bad thing .
The l at ter is that going outside in w in ter is re l u c t ant be ha v i or as much as possible !
U s ing L an g 8 may be a way to make a friend .
D o es some on e know a English speak er who want to study J a p an e se .
P le a se Let me know .
I can help S t ud y ing J a p an e se in s te ad of le ar n ing English .
When I was enjoy ing cha t ting at about 3 - ish , I consider ed if I should go to be d , but I thought if I went to be d once I would n ' t be able to w a ke up at 6 and con t in u ed cha t ting ti ll I went to school .
I was a b it sleep y at school , so I de c id ed not to do the same things again .
A l m o st all j a p an e se business man us e train .
Some of them see mo b i le p age s , and read some b ook s , the other sleep in the train .
Some time s they who are sea ted on cha ir le an against me .
It ' s we i g h ty .
I think they are very tired at their office , because of their a l ot of hard work .
So they want to sleep more long time as possible as they can .
To day people next to me is so .
I ' m J a p an e se woman .
I want to express my thought in English .
I de c id ed that this year , I write di ar y every day , and I ' ll be c he c k ed my English some on e on L an g - 8 on in ter ne t .
She is J a p an e se , and works n an n y in E ng l and .
So , I want to speak English .
P l ant a you ng tree s
Yes ter day father and I p l ant ed a you ng tree s .
They are five kind of tree s which are about one or two - year old .
They ' re ma p le s , v in es , and some k or e an n at ive kind of tree s .
B e f or e we go to our ga r d en to p l ant , we went to a re st a ur ant for l un ch .
Then we me t my el d est s is ter co up le by ch ance in the re st a ur ant .
My b ro ter - in - l ow who ' s name is M r .
p ar k , j o in ed .
And we p l ant d e tree s and c le an the ga r d en .
It take d about two hour s to finish .
Yes ter day , a friend of mi ne re c o m m en d ed me this we b s ite .
To a new come r like me , it is a re ally very interest ing and us e ful we b s ite .
I find what most appeal s to me is that one can im p ro ve his or her ability in a for e i g n language while make new friend s from all over the world .
D is ne y c ar t o on was very funny and made us am a z ing .
My mo m , you ng er s is ter and I de c id ed ti go to see the mo v i e this morning .
The ti c ke t s is ex p en s ive because we need put on the g la s se s to see the mo v i e .
I l o ve D is ne y ' s mo v i e .
I went a hot sp r ing to day .
It o c c ur r ed to me that J a p an e se does n ' t he s it ate to take a bath with other s is but sh y to talk with for e i g n er s .
I think that ' s why J a p an e se is sh y .
How do you think about this ?
A n an n u al meeting of so c i e ty for ne ur o s c i ence will be he l d from the next S at ur day to We d ne s day at C h ic a g o .
This is the first time to go U .
And I have n ' t us e in ter n ation al f light alone .
I know almost nothing about in ter n ation al tra ve l !
And some time people say s `` U .
So , I ' m re ally an x i ous about this tra ve l .
To day I b ough t a b ook written by M or im i To m i h i k o at the b ook st or e in my co ll e g e , where all the co ll e g e students and teachers can bu y b ook s at a five per s ent dis c o un t off the re g ul ar p ri ce .
M o st of the J a p an e se co ll e g es have such b ook st or es . ) The ti t le of the b ook was ' K it s un e No H an ash i . ' ( ' K it s un e No H an ash i ' mean s ' A story about a f o x . ' ) I found that the story was very my s ter i ous .
I do n ' t think M or im i To m i h i k o is co m m on all over the world , so let me explain who he is .
No w he live s in K y ot o and the set ting s of most of his no ve l s are K y ot o .
T h ough many of the ma in character s in his no ve l s are d u ll co ll e g e students , his litera ry style is very co l or ful and so p h is t ic at ed !
In J a p an , his b ook s are very p op ul ar among you ng people , es pe c i ally among co ll e g e students .
When ever I read his b ook s , I am f as c in at ed with his wonder ful litera ry style .
F u ther m or e , his story is very enjoy able .
A n y way , I am fond of the b ook s written by M or im i To m i h i k o .
But I ' m afraid his b ook s are very difficult to tra n s l ate into another language .
I ' m going to f in is read ing ' K it s un e No H an ash i ' to day .
, A fter that , I have to conc ent r ate on the p re p ar ation for the S T E P t est on the next S un day !
B e c a us e I want draw CHA R T S in ex ce l by p y th on , I ' m read ing mi c ro s o f t ex ce l b in ar ies .
E x ce l b in ar y for m at is know n as `` C o m p ound D o c u ment `` .
The first se c t or is `` head er se c t or `` that in d ic ate s `` di ction ar y se c t or `` , and da ta str u c ture like F A T ( f i le all o c ation t able ) in F A T 1 6 / 3 2 f il es y s te m .
The by te str e a m is se qu ence s of B I F F R e c or d s .
I had n ' t ever had ex p re ri ence of a ha ll stuff me m b er , so I always be ten s ed up d ur ing work ing .
R e c ent ly , I feel a little re la x that I got a c c ust ome d to work ing as a ha ll stuff me m b er .
To day is the most bu s y day in my ex pe ri ence days .
I can not only having a b re a k but dr in k ing a g la s s of water .
To m or r ow , I have a work as a ha ll stuff me m b er but I have a ho l i day day after to m m or r ow , so I can stand it .
The U S p re s id ent B us h will finish his ter m soon .
In my opinion , I ' ve always thought he is re ally in c a p able and d u ll .
( A g a in , it ' s just my person al opinion . ) In sp ite of in c a p able people , they can be a po l it ic i an .
There are a l ot of such po l it ic i an s in J a p an , too .
P ro b ably , they also could be a head of state , if they had something a d v ant age , such as c r ow d - p ul ling cha ri s m a .
So I ' m wonder ing what is B us h ' s a d v ant age .
I still c a n ' t find it .
A ccord ing to the new s , the sh o es were not the re p or ter ' s own one s .
He p re p ar ed big and he a v y sh o es for this at ta c k .
If it had hi t B us h , he must have got ten in j ur ed .
Then , f in ally I found B us h ' s a d v ant age .
What a good re f le x es he has .
He has c at - like - re f le x es .
I wonder if he was play ing any sp or t s when he was you ng .
If J a p an e se po l it ic i an s were him , they would get hi t and in j ur ed ter ri b ly .
I do n ' t think he could be the U S p re s id ent d u e to his good re f le x though .
I think you watch it a l ot of time s , but look at his in c r ed i ble re f le x es again !
E s pe c i ally , the first th r ow ing !
N e x t month , I will go to a co ll age .
I become fool ish .
I have been be l on g to ten n is c l u b .
I usual ly play ten n is six time s in a week .
The back one is I have for g ot ten see ing the name ta g of it .
The s and ow i ch co st s 2 8 0 y en and I at e first time .
M a y b e I c a n ' t get ra w ha m at or d in a ly st or es .
It ta st es high - gra d e hu m !
To day is mo n day , I just finish ed my ho l i day and back from my home t ow n .
No w , I ' m work ing in my comp an y , I feel a little tired , may b e I enjoy ed to much in this ho l i day , so I c a n ' t a c c l im at i z e myself to different place or pe po le e t c .
I think a f e w days la ter I can get right .
R e c ent ly , I feel it ' s to bad .
that ' s make me feel to bad .
I think I need a big re la x to help me f i x this question .
So I will do more ex er c is e to re la x myself .
I think I can make this question go away .
I d ropped in a de p ar t ment st or e at N i h o m b ash i on my way to come back home .
A fter four days , I will do a C h ri st m as part y .
I will ex change my friend s to present s ga ther ed by us .
It co st s about 1 0 0 0 Y en per one .
I was at a los s for a while , but I b ough t sh o es - keep er in v o l v ed in de o d or i z er s .
N an o te ch no l o g y is one of the most pro m is ing are a for s c i ence and te ch no l o g y f i el d .
B e c a us e of it s part ic le s i z e , which is less than 1 0 0 n m , n an p ar t ic le has me ch an ic ally , physical ly , c he m ic ally , and electronic ally different proper t ies than that of bu l k ma ter i al s .
E ng in e er ed n an op ar t ic le is a p p l i ed for dr u g de l ive ry , so l ar ce ll s , c le an man u f a c t ur ing pro ce s s , co s m etic s , and so for th .
V en ture c a p it al s , go ver n ment s , and in d ust ri es has in ve st ed t re m en d ous money for sp ur r ing the in no v ation of n an o te ch no l o g y .
While the b ri g h t side of e m er g ing n an o te ch no l o g y has been ex ten s ive ly co ver ed by me d i a , the s a f e ty of n an op ar t ic le has at t r a c ted small at ten tion .
B e c a us e of it s s i z e , n an op ar t ic le could in t r ud e our l un g when we are ex po s ed t o it .
On ce n an op ar t ic le is in the en v ir on ment as pro d u c t s or by p ro d u c t from fact or ies , it is p r a c t ic ally im po s s i ble to de te c t because of the part ic le s i z e as well .
English pro no un ce ation
I have work ed for an A m er ic an comp an y for 4 y e ar s .
A ll of my co ll e a gue are b il ing u al s .
O f c o ur ce each English le ve l s are different but my comp an y require s at least 73 0 to e ic point .
There f or e , our e m p l o y e es English le ve l is high er than other J a p an e se comp an ies .
O ther co un t ri es , for ex a p m le G er man y , most of business people can speak English rather than J a p an e se .
H ence , 73 0 to e ic point s are co m m on for them .
But the a c c ent of English is not associated with To e ic s c or e .
Even if people who have 9 0 0 to e ic s c or e , their pro n un c i ation is not good .
I found this fact when I j um p ed in this comp an y .
A woman co ll e a gue can write English e - ma il very well but her speak ing has very strong J a p an e se a c c ent .
It ' s difficult for us to im p ro ve the pro n un c i ation only by read ing or writing for e i g n language .
F or A m er ic an , J a p an e se `` F ut on `` is a mi s ter i ous sound because sha pe of mo us e for `` F u `` is different between A m er ic an and J a p an e se .
I ' m not e ng l ish very well , but I re ally want f l u ent e ng l ish s k i ll .
I want talk about many story but it ' s difficult . . . .
English class is be st of be st hard s h i p .
I c a n ' t understand that my e ng l ish pro f es s s or ' s le c ture . . . .
I do not understand the us e of p re po s i tion s such as in , on , at , and of .
it was re in y to day .
it was very di f f ic l ut ! ! ! !
The t est that the t est write s a character beautiful ly .
It is very sh in y s un n y and di z z i ly hot to day .
P le a se take care not to get de h y d r at ed or not to s u f f er he at str o ke .
You had better not to ex po s ed the s un sh in e and he at for very long time .
E n ough water and e le c t ro ly te s help you from he at at ta c k .
T a ke good care and enjoy s um m er as well as possible .
I like five - f ing er s ock s and we ar it almost every day .
It ' s quite co m f or t able because my feet do n ' t get s w e at y .
One day , a friend of mi ne found me we ar ing five - f ing er s ock s and said to me , `` I know it ' s co m f or t able and I like it too , but c a n ' t we ar it .
When my mo m was we ar ing five - f ing er s ock s , da d said that it was enough to turn off even a l o ve that last ed a 1 0 0 year s ( a J a p an e se pro ver b ) .
M m m , it may look a little go o f y , but I do n ' t think it that bad .
How do you feel if your girl f ri en d or bo y f ri en d we ar it ?
You should try we ar ing it if you have never w or n .
Some th ing f un !
My friend P h il i p p and I went to office this morning by bu s .
He had to call one guy who would hand a ke y over to him .
The one was ent r ust ed by P h il i p p ' s G er man friend .
A t begin n ing , `` # $ % ! @ # % ! @ # $ `` P h il i p p said in G er man . but the one op po s ite end s of the p h on e line did n ' t re p ly .
So P h il i p p said , `` D o you speak G er man or English ? `` And then , they cha t with English .
A fter two or three sen t ence s , ' D o you speak C h in e se ?
And he turn ed to speak C h in e se .
The guy is a C h in e se as we are . .
I was laugh ing unti l we get out of the bu s .
I start English t w e e t .
I ' m going to t w e e t da i ly life , family , sp or t s , my job and more in English .
If you ' ve had t w it ter account , please follow me .
J a p an e se mar ri g e s y s te m
In my country , we do not need to v ow when we get mar ri ed .
B ri d es and gr o o m s simpl y go to c ity office s and turn into the mar ri g e a p p l ic ation for m , which has the b ri d es ' , the gr o o m s ' , and two w it t ness es ' s i g un i ture s .
No picture I D s are re qu i er ed to turn into the mar ri g e a p p l ic at in for m .
Even the law does not require the co up le to come to the c ity office .
Some body else can go there in s ter d of the co up le .
B e c ous e of the s y s te m , some time s pro ble m s are a ri s en .
When a co up le go to the c ity office to ture n in their mar r age for m , they some time s find out that one of them ( or both of them ) is al r ed y mar ri ed to some on e else .
No one person has receiv ed more prais e and a b us e than S te ve n J o b s , who is the C E O of A P P L E & P I X A R c or p or ation , as well as has being co ver person over 2 0 0 f a m ous ma g a z in es .
I was as t on ish ed by J o b s ' s le c ture spoke n in S t an f or d U n ive r s ity in 2 0 0 5 , which includ ing three st or ies , and tell us should follow our heart to find our go al s .
He did n ' t know what ' s the mean ing of con t in u ing his study in a co ll e g e which fee s is so ex p en s ive that co st most part s of his p ar ent s ' money .
In s te ad of this , J o b s started to dr op in the call i g r a p h y class in his co ll e g e , which s up p l i ed the one of be st call i g r a p h y train ing in the who le country .
A t that time s , he just interest ed in this class but have not a w ar ed of the im p or t ance .
U n t il did he c re at the first A P P L E comp ut er , all the effect s what he had done before came back .
On ly did you tru st something what follow ed your heart as well as work hard , one day when you look ing back , you can clear ly know the se c re t s of the se do t s you have done .
He was ex pe led on the gr ant s c al e from A P P L E , which comp an y was c re at ed himself .
N ever th e less , he said that he has been re j e c t , but he still l o ve .
D r a m at ic ally , the se str i k ing things let him found his dr e a m b o at , est a b l ish ed a new comp an y : N E X T , p ur ch as ed P L X A R and became the C E O of A P P L E again .
So do n ' t settled , keep look ing your l o ve .
now I ' m f in ally writing my j o ur n al . . . . !
A c t u ally , the se days are kind of he c t ic and I could n ' t sp ar e time for do ing that .
But it is a fact that I had n ' t been writing j o ur n al s .
Even though I s k i p p ed it for only 1 day .
let me explain it !
F ir st , when I want ed to write it , something was wrong with my P C !
To make matter s w or se , there were no time left for me .
As those who have read my j o ur n al s know , I started work ing part time ( the con t ent s is that g i v ing out le a f le t s outside ) and I was kind of bu s y .
In fact , I did it too to day .
I said that I e ar n enough money on my own to study a b ro ad at the A ust r al i a , but this job is a little hard .
L O L In addition , when I do it , I am a v o id ed by people in most case . . . .
I went back home from U S A yesterday .
I re al i z ed many di f f er ence s between J a p an the U S d ur ing my 3 week s stay in the E a st C o a st .
S e c on d ly , street s in the U S are de s i g n ed in gr id style , and each street s have their s own name s .
F or in st ance , the name s of the street s are number s ( like `` E 3 2 S t re e t `` , `` 5 th a ve n u e `` ) in N e w Y or k .
I ho pe will me e t some n at ive speak er s and some on e
who have many idea s to express for my sen ten se s .
O f course , I also will j o in to help W h o are le ar n ing J a p an e se .
I read the ar t ic le about S t ar b u c k In st ant co f f e e in the As a h i
I suppose most of A m er ic an people know it well , as it ' s been being so l d since a year a g o .
My A m er ic an friend has kept sen d ing it to me , I ' ve been enjoy ing it every day .
If you are a S t ar b u c k s f an , it would be w or th to try it .
S a k y o say s `` I could n ' t ex c ept a b ook e v o l u tion s like this al th ough I am a s c i - f i write r `` .
I have a certain o b se s s ion about the train .
It was off at 5 : 3 0 a m be ne a th the mo on light to take the train left at 6 : 0 0 A M
What I had done on train was to go s s i p something happen ed in the class with my p al s
when ever I heard the sound came from train st ation
It was very co l d day to day , even though J un e is coming tomorrow .
I think that it is kind of hot and very hu m id sea s on in J un e , a J a p an ' s ra in y sea s on .
So I ho pe there will be no high hu m id ity .
I have only live d in J a p an , but I ha te J a p an e se very very very hu m id c l im ate in s um m er !
L a c k M ot i v ation
But , I was at home all day without do ing anything particular ly .
It ' s re ally was te of time .
I think I ' d rather go out than stay at home us e less ly .
But , I do n ' t feel like going out as well when I do n ' t feel like do ing it though I have what to do like a re p or t .
I always re g re t it after finish ing the day .
It is very bad morning .
N ever go the street s of S t .
P e ter s b ur g to - 2 0 de g re es .
H ot co f f e , s i g ar e t te s and w ar m b l an ke t - this mi ne to day ' s need .
I ' m k n it ting a c ro ch e t case for hand y p h on e .
I would like to present for my gr and m o ther and my for m er students .
If I have many time , I c ro ch e t a c a p for my hu s b and : - )
When I entered the sen i or high school and j o in ed the mo un tain e er ing c l u b in 1 996 , I b ough t a head light by P an as on ic .
To day ' s first l o g in - day .
I ' m s y s te m con s ul t ant .
and I will qu it my job the end of next month .
I will home - make r and will take care of ch il d re n .
I some time s come to E C C , E C C is English con ver s ation school .
My comp an y pai d 8 0 % fee for me .
But I will qu it it , after that I ' m go n n a study English .
and I ho pe con ver s ation every on e .
D o you know a hot - water bo t t le ?
It ' s a bo t t le made of p la st ic or other things ( I do n ' t know ex a c t ly . ) in which you po ur hot water .
You put it in your be d on the co l d night , so you can w ar m your feet and sleep very well .
It ' s a wonder ful ar t ic le .
U n f or t un ate ly , the other day , I ' ve got a small ho le in the one that I ' ve us ed for s ever al year s .
So I went to go sh op p ing to bu y another one .
F or t un ate ly , I found something better .
It ' s a kind of a hot - water bo t t le , but there are c er ry see d s in the b a g .
You put it in the mi c ro - w a ve for 3 m in , and read y to be us ed !
It was a little b it more ex p en s ive , but it will be soon my b ir th day .
So I b ough t two , one for my feet and the other for my ne c and should er .
I ' m not interest ed in B ud d h is m , but yesterday I st ud i ed a little .
I came to think that B ud d h is m might have pro f ound teaching s .
B ud d ha mean s a person who is spirit u ally a w a k en ed .
However , even if we could so l ve the trouble , unless we would so l ve the ro ot of the trouble s , we would be in another trouble like that re pe at ed ly .
B ud d ha had know n the ro ot of trouble which are co m m on in man k in d .
When B ud d ha would have help ed people in trouble , he had thought not only the trouble in front of them , but also the who le trouble should have been so l v ed .
The va l u e of c ur re n c y al way change .
Even I have done the de al for three year s , I still con f us e the mo v ing of the M ar ke t some time s .
My tra d e re ly on the two b as ic for m s of an a ly s is : f un d a ment al an a ly s is and the te ch n ical an a ly s is .
F un d a ment al an a ly s is is b as ed on which the p ri ce will re f le c t the big new s .
The ch n ical an a ly s is us e the cha r t s as the object s .
L ook my tra d e the re c ent ly :
C h in a s up p or t P or t u g al and bu y the n ation al bo n d s .
How do you think my de al me th o d ?
I think every man have to believe something
H um an is so we a k so always want to believe something .
In k or e a for e i g n mission ar ies have been s u c c se e ful ly bra in w ash ed people .
I living in a small c ity where to t al p op ul ation is almost 2 0 0 0 0 0 .
but In my c ity hu n d r ed s ch ur ch s are here .
every ho l i day people come into my house tell me about go d and if I do n ' t believe in go d I will go to the he ll .
our country us ed to believe d in bu d ha but since a d v ance d co un t ri es open ed our mar ke t by for ce 7 0 % of people are c a th o l ic s and pro t est ant s even old man s start ing to go to a ch ur ch .
It ' s good to go to a ch ur ch but do n ' t push ing other s to believe it .
he might do n ' t th r ow away at he is t s to the he ll .
just one reason I did n ' t be l ive him .
he ll o !

Some time s I go a b ro ad , such as T a i w an and another as i an country .
English is co m m un ic ation too l and the most p op ul ar in the world .
I think co m m un ic ation too l give us some ch ance s .
If possible , I work with for e i g n people us ing my e ng l ish .
The f l ow er s keep f l ow er ing and ri s ing up to w ar d s the S un .
F ri en d is hold ing a k n if e or a g un .
A ll around you does n ' t mean a thing .
I got the me l an ch o l ic time which give s me a re f le c t of life that has already pass ed me by .
It hi t me and it even made me ma k ing r h y m es .
But some time s I think that good life is n ' t b ook ed for each one who want s it .
I wish that G o d he l d your hand in the time full of do u b t s . .
The moment that last s can be the be st moment of all you had .
You still have new friend s , the old one s are co ver ed by a d ust .
`` English c a f e `` was open ed every first S un day once a month and many students , teachers and C h ri st i an s ga ther the part y .
It was different the usual ly less on , the students and the teachers were re la x and f un .
I made many C h ri st i an s friend s there .
I ' m not C h ri st i an but I was ha p p y to ma k ing friend s .
If I was woman ~
I ' ll think of a b it about if I was woman .
The reason I ' ll think of it is just enjoy able for me .
If I was woman , the f i g ur e would be more l o ve ly than se x y .
She would have long ha ir ha ng ing down the ch est , and the ha ir co l or must be black .
The person al ity would be rather c al m than to m b o y ish .
M a y b e she would n ' t be so act ive , so she would n ' t be l on g to any c l u b .
She would n ' t be do ing so poor ly at school , but she would ha te study ing .
He r ty pe would be a man who is a little bra w n y and has a tender heart .
D o o d dinner at o m i y a
F or t un ate ly we can us e e le c t ri c p ow er all day long to day , which made as sp en d a day as usual .
Yes ter day I went to T s ut a y a ( it is the big g est r ent al D V D and C D sh op in J a p an .
However , we can bu y new D V D s and C D s there . ) with my family because my hu s b and want ed to b or r ow some D V D s from the sh op .
And then , I dis c o ver ed many im p or ted C D s are s el ling for 8 0 per c ent off .
I ' m very ha p p y because I could b ough t each C D for only 3 0 0 yen ! ! !
It ' s very c he a p ! ! !
To day is the last days of go l d en week .
D ur ing go l d en week , I could n ' t le ar n English any m or e .
There f or e , from tomorrow , I would l o ve to le ar n English again .
I know I should we ar them but they make me look like an id i ot .
P e op le tell me to where con ta c t l en s but I think it make s my eyes un he al th y a b s or b ing tea r s in my eyes .
T r u th ful ly , I have los t more than five pai r s of l en s so it is never w or th it .
I think my bad eyes i g h t is d u e to that I like watch ing , read ing , and writing .
A ll of my good friend s mo v ed to a dis t ant place for reason s .
I ' m very conc er n ed with it .
I have heard of that mo ng o l i an people ' s eyes i g h t is very good d u e to the no bu il d ing s and no mo n it or s en v ir on ment .
They always see a dis t ant not like us .
A n y way , some day , I want to get l as ic if it can im p ro ve my eyes i g h t c a us ing no side effect s .
A ll of we should re m e m b er to we ar more c l o th es ^ .
The day before yesterday , it is a sp e c i al d ate to our you th es .
It is so called You th D a y which ce le b r ate s the you th es ' con t ri b u tion to our country .
We are just the f l ow er s gr ow ing up he al th i ly and will serve the country after gr ow n up .
I feel for t un ate that I can live in such a country with sp e ed ly de ve l op ing e c on o m y and s up er i or mi l it ar y p ow er .
As a un ive r s ity st ud ent in the present age , I have a he a v y b ur d en on my should er , so I know that I should have the will to bu il d our country strong er and take every a ction to ga in a good know led g e of s c i ence .
We gr il led be e f , c or n s and s a us age s .
I enjoy ed some be er !
A s ing el house
There are s ever al different ty pe s of house s in A m er ic an .
So far , I ' ve visit ed town house s , con d o s , a p ar t ment s , ex c ept s ing le house s .
I heard about a s ing le house s is very p ri ce y .
A b s o l ut e ly , you have your own ga r d en without sh ar ing it with other s .
L a st week , I sp ent two days to stay over at my father ' s friend s ' place .
It is re ally a l u x ur y house .
The ga r d en ing of the front y ar d is very n ic e .
The ant i ma in tain it in a very ne at and or g an i z ed condition .
No t only the front y ar d is good but also the back y ar d is too .
They bu il t a out d o or f i re p la ce and a B B Q st o ve .
It is two - floor - high and there is a sp ir al s ta ir c a se there .
E ver y room has it s own bath ro o m and each of it has 2 s in k for hand was h ing .
The most sp e c i al room is that there is a in d o or w in d ow of it .
You can stand in the room and see the who le p an or a m a of first - floor living room .
The S ta f f V al u ed H ome Even t T h an The W or k
I w ro te about a t est of the ra d i ation con ta m in ation for f o o d s before .
The ra d i ation sp e c i al i z ed s ta f f s have been perform ing this in s pe ction .
However , our s ta f f s were asked for the help because of the short age of the t est me m b er .
To day the s ta f f who was de c id ed as a help er want ed the change of the d ate .
The reason is because he want s to part ic i p ate in the a th l etic me e t of the ch il d .
B e c a us e we de c id ed the d ate after having heard the s ta f f ' s con ve n i ence , this is not almost possible .
I was surprise d that there was the s ta f f who va l u ed home even t than the work .
I ' ve f in ally got ten why they w on the world c up .
O f course , my go al is to be as good an English speak er as a n at ive English speak er .
but I must get the good s c or e with the T O E I C so that I do my be st to English now .
While I get into the study ing English , my la b has be g un the pro j e c t that la b students have make a g l id er ro b ot .
There is hard er and hard er work ing the pro j e c t .
We had felt difficult y that we make the g l id er ro b ot .
That ` s why we took a l ot ex t r a time .
I want to us e time the English study more than I do that .
I ` m re c on s id er ing to a d j ust ment my s ch ed ul e .
I have never for g e t to make good both things .
The life after ma ter n ity leave
This is the first time for me to write di r a y in English .
I ' m re ally ha p p y if some on e kind ly read and c he c k my English .
L a st week en d , my hu s b and was not at home , so I invite d my friend s in comp an y on both sat ur day and s un day .
They said they were bu s y , and they had to get many days off because their ch il d re n of ten got sick .
In her case , her mother live s near her , so she can get her mother ' s help , and she does ' n t need to get off work .
I felt down when I im a g in ed the life after I started work ing again .
I tea ch It al i an and English ( funny but tru e ) in an As s o c i ation where street bo y s and girl s with difficult back g r ound s are help ed with their home w or k s .
One of the guy perform ed in the show so he invite d me and other teacher to s up p or t him .
What change s happen d ?
I want to write the one of the big g est change s to night .
It is natural , but I have had life with my p ar ent s for 2 7 year s .
I was depend ed on my p ar ent s , and in f l u ence s from my p ar ent s was large .
I believe my a ction was limit ed with in my p ar ent s all ow ed .
So now I ' m feel ing so free as if I were a b ir d le aving a n est .
F or t un ate ly my has b and do n ' t in ter f er e me .
No w after mar ri age , six month s pass ed .
And then I started two things , because I felt I can do anything .
I want to write about new things next time .
D I A R Y , my b ro will en l is t into k or e a mi l it ar y .
My b ro will en l is t into mi l it ar y .
K or e a is di v id ed into So u th k or e a and No r th k or e a .
the se day s in ter n ation al new s are not good for every on e who live in k or e a .
( you know the Y e on P y e on g D o ' s new s ) So , my family and my re l ation s are w or ri ed about him .
But , he just said that every man in k or e a should go to the mi l it ar y , ex c ept the dis able .
So , do n ' t worry about me .
He j o k ed `` P le a se bu y me at for visit ing , es p ch i ch en , da k g al b i . . . ``
I look ing for w ar d to re c ome b a c k to home . . .
he will dis change at 2 0 1 3 . . .
how long do we have to wait for him ? !
To day was very bu s y day .
I went to G an g n a m st ation to study English in P a g o d a a c ad e m y .
I me t my friend who s er v ic ed in mar in e b and .
We talk ed about the old days d ur ing about three hour s .
I went to comp ut er a c ad e m y after meeting .
The le c ture of to day was so difficult , however , I did my be st to make good pro g r a m .
M o st of the people are old er than me .
E s pe c i ally , an old man who sit in the next of my desk is the old est people in our class .
I thought he will be very hard to le ar n to make pro g r a m .
I am right .
so , I always help him ma k ing pro g r a m .
My name is M ar i C ar m en and I ' m a sp an i ar d new us er of L an g - 8 .
I ho pe to im p ro ve my e ng l ish here and I want to le ar n f re n ch too .
N e x t year , I want to study a M aster of D es i g n in a B ri t ish or F re n ch U n ive r s ity .
I ho pe to help with sp an ish language to some body who need it .
I to t ally agree d with his opinion .
How long they work a day is kind of con t ro ll ed by the ur g ent de m and s from their va ri ous s ta ke h o l d er s , so they do n ' t have any dis c re tion ar y z on e .
The w or d s spoke n out of mouth is str e ng th less , and e y e con ta c t s are full of con f us ion .
It re m in d s me of the B able story , G o d se p er ate s people with different language s , and people are never un it ed as one any more because of the language s , then the world is full of s us p ic i ous ness and f r ust r ation .
K e e p ing going !
To day is so tired : P
everything make me c r a z y
I do n ' t know what happen may b e just feel con f us ed .

And I have question s . .

A fter I ent er an e le ment ry school my p ar ent s change their sh op to f ri ed ch ic k en re st a ur ant e .
And after a f e w year s , they change d me n u to p or k c ut le t .
A ll of my friend s en v y ed me .
And now they run gr il led me e t re st a ur ant e .
When I had my for t un e told on in ter ne t , I was di ed in e ar ly age because of hung er in my previous life .
I would like to w ir te a letter to my English teacher , so I want you to c or re c t my English .

I ' ve never me t a n at ive teacher like you who have been study ing hard er J a p an e se .
I do n ' t know what I should do without you from now on . . .
well , I have a present for you .
I give you a re d b a ll po in t p en .
I will be re ally ha p p y if you could c or re c t my English some day in this p en .
I took the free way first time .
I had n ' t take n the free way before .
L a st S un day was my f r at er ' s b ir th day .
So I came to the J e on g se on - g un that my p ar ent s live .
I dr o ve alone , I ' m not afraid of dr i v i g any m or e .
I ' m good at c ut ting in c ar s .
H a ve you dr ive n in K or e a ?
It ' s so over c r ow d ed with c ar .
Some of the c ar have no manner s .
I do n ' t sub m it to no manner s ' s c ar because I ' m bra ve woman ? ! ^ ^
I do n ' t go because my ex - hu s b and will come .
`` D o n ' t leave ch il d re n , I c a n ' t take care of them ! ``
He do n ' t like that I leave ch il d re n at ch ur ch .
But ch il d re n like to play at ch ur ch , and ma b e , their feel ha p p y to me e t their far ther I thought .
I ' m so full of s ad ness . . .
I want to be a kind er g ar ten teacher because I like a small ch il d is .
I went to sh op p ing to G in z a after work .
I b ough t a shirt which co l or is de e p p in k .
The shirt see m s too ti g h t I feel .
But I like this .
It ' s by far the most great T - shirt I think .
I got in to u ch my girl friend and I say `` I like it !
I live in S ant i a g o de C h i le , in a small town at the outside of the c ity .
In the first floor I have a k it ch en , a living room , and a di n ing room .
A t the second floor I have my room and two room s more for my family .
The wall s of my house are y e ll ow , and the ce il ing is w h ite in all the house .
The se days , I always bu s y .
B e c a us e , the t est days are near .
I have to do my home w or k s .
In addition , I ' m bu s y my part time job , too ! !
I can hard ly wait for the sp ling va c ation .
How to get dr i v ing l ic en se success ful ly ?
This week en d , I will go to train ing gr ound to le ar n dr i v ing with train er .
T h ough I understand some know led g e , I never dr ive a c ar .
There is some str es s for this train ing .
What no is e it is outside !
It ' s too loud to f a ll as le e p , it ' s about 4 : 3 0 am here in J a p an though .
N ever th e less , my w if e see m s able to keep sleep ing even under
I wonder if we even here are s a f e .
that the sp ar k s set f i re to it s s ur r ound ing house s and sp re ad the f i re .
W h o did it ?
are them id ent ical ?
I even did n ' t re al i z e what happen ed unti l the week pass ed .
And it seemed that I for g ot a l ot of things , like find ing a part time job , ma k ing a call to my mo m .
I quite did n ' t know what I was bu s y with , it just pass ed .
F ir st , d ur ing the week day , I got a little bu s y , and things about my work seemed got better , because my co ll e a gue s treat ed much better last week , and they seemed more believe in me now , ex c ept one , who have never say anything n ic e to me .
L i ke me , I am not very p at i ent and sen s it ive about number s , but now , my work is close re la ted to number s , It make s me le ar n to be much more p at i ent and care ful .
And I have le ar n ed another im p or t ant s k i ll , that is to write down everything that you do n ' t know , or you can not re m e m b er clear ly , es pe c i ally which are very im p ro t ant to your job .
I know that I should be con f id ent , and should be more sen s it ive , so that my co ll e g es will believe me more .
It seemed like I did n ' t p re p ar e it well , but it also pass ed quick ly .
In fact , this is my second time to me e t a E - friend , but the se two time all turn ed out well .
L i ke me , before I went to see my E - friend s , I was quite s c ar ed , and I was p r a y for a good l u c k .
But don ot over re a c t to it , because there are also a l ot of n ic e people in the world !
M an y big w a ve s are coming to the sea by the in f l u ence that T y h o on is a p p ro a ch ing now .
It ' s good day for s ur f er es .

Yes ter day was so co l d and w in d y so that it was too hard for us to run .
But we ra n about 1 hour with talk ing each other .
T r a in ing body is im p or t ant .

My house is near to a po st office .

When I go to the mar ke t I can see many kind s of things , such as a b ar b er sh op , a sh op p ing ma ll , and a kid s ' school , as well as my school .

That ' s why I can speak co m m on a c c ent too .
I took a class to study J a p an e se language str u c ture to be a volunteer to day .
O ur teacher told us we should not be as ha m ed of our own a c c ent s because each a c c ent s were c re at ed by their c ul ture s .
She let me speak al o ud my a c c ent in front of other students .
I wonder if many people all over the world are pro ud of their original language s .
I ' m very pro ud of my a c c ent now !
B e c a us e it was g if ted by my ance s ter .
To day I had a G A B A ' s less on with a new teacher who was from E ng l and .

I le ar n t I need to have more va ri ous point of view through this se m in ar .
A fter the se m in ar , some part ic i p ant s includ ing the teacher and I went for a dr in k at a b ar .
We talk ed a l ot and had a b la st , and it was f un that one of the part ic i p ant s talk ed his ex pe ri ence s when he ' d been in G er m a y .

He is good at c re at i v ity and make a good de c is ion .

The other day , I saw a w ome n who play game walk ing a bu s y street !
I like play ing a game too .
But we must ch o o se place s to play a game .
I wonder What do for e i g n er s think about this .
S in ce both my language ex ch an g ing part n er s , Z a c and M ar k are bu s y for school , I some time s talk to them though , I think it is n ' t enough for me to speak English .
I ' m very tired . .

He was tak ing ho l i day from 1 8 th D e ce m b er to 1 8 th J an u ar y .
So we had a less on another teacher who is E th i op i an d u er ng his ho l i day .
We have a less on from E th i op i an more than English teacher l ate ly .
He question one by one , we try to answer but some st ud ent can not answer
When another st ud ent help s to the one , he said at once `` I asked her , not you . ! ``
It end ed un p la s ant at m o s p he re .
A fter that we f e ar ed all this time .
But , I ' m look ing for w or d to my friend s coming here .
This week en d is going to finish after 2 hour s .
I have to sleep e ar ly to day .
It ' s my b ir th day yesterday .
My friend told me that she w an n a give me a s up ri se .
She took the p h on e n um ble of my ex .
I thought she would call him because she know n I ' m very very very mi s s ing him .
But he do not mi s s me .
Then I told the girl - - - do n ' t do anything .
W a it ing , just wait ing .
L o ver ' s day .

It ' s very c al m and clear a ir .

A l s o I was not ic ed my c ity is b ri g h t .
We ' ve for g ot ten there are many star s in the s k y .
If they not ic ed it , they turn off light s more than before not ic e .
I knew , I like nature and an im al but I ' d not know n , I like a far m life so much .
I was living at Tokyo in J a p an before I ' ve come C an ad a since 3 0 th , M a y , 2 0 1 1 .
Tokyo is bu s y and always c r ow d ed that why .
I ho pe I could live in a r ur al place .
I was surprise d when I knew about this we b s ite .
O f course , this is because the a g ed have more money than the you ng er .
In an a g ing so c i e ty , the a g ed are im p or t ant t ar g e t s .
S aving money is l o o m i g as the bad c ir c ul ation .
A il ing J a p an eyes a s al v ation of at t r a c ting the a g ed .
I am p l an n n ing to stay in H on g K on g for a month .
And I ' ve s er ch ed i nformation about where to stay there .
In the place that I want to r ent house , the a ver age p ri ce you bu y a house is about 3 5 0 0 0 0 ( $ 5 4 8 4 . 5 ) y u an per square me ter and the a ver age p ri ce you co st to r ent 6 0 square me ter house is about 5 0 0 0 y u an per month .
C on s id er you are the house own er , the house will co st you 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 y u an .
If you let the house , you can get 6 0 0 0 0 y u an one year .
That is to say , you money only gr ow in a ra te of 2 . 8 6 % , while the c ur r ent one - year de po s it ra te is 3 . 5 % .
With the fact that the house p ri ce have stop p ed from ri s ing , why not the house own er se ll the house and de po s it the money to b an k or do ing other in ve st ment ?
I s the ho us ing p ri ce in B e i j ing is too more high ?
I would like to the ho us ing p ri ce and r ent place in your place , could you tell me ?
I could n ' t hand le it well yet , but I felt the came r a had very good perform ance .
The at ta ch ed p h ot o is some street scene at S t an f or d un ive r s ity .
I set the came r a ' s mo d e as No st al g ic M o d e .
And find something interest ing to take picture s and po st my b l o g .
can not to bu y a re p la ce ment for two year s .
Some people also do the same p l an , but the p ri ce are different .
to be con t in u e .
The new comp a c t di g it al came r a C X 2 is re le as ed from R ic o h .
This new came r a has the new f un ction .
It can take the p h ot o g r a p h like the mi n i a ture .
I ' m look ing at the l and s c a pe like to y s .
A g e of the future , I think that the new comp a c t di g it al came r a has the f e a ture .
The p h ot o g r a p h be l ow is took by the new di g it al came r a .
D o you look at the l and s c a pe like to y s ?
L un ch T im e T ri p !
My office is near by a bo t an ical ga r d en .
So some time s I go there to have a l un ch .

H aving a l un ch under ch er ry b l o s s o m s is a f ant a st ic ex pe ri ence !
M or e o ver , a small mo un tain and a la ke is also near by my office .
It take s about 5 minute s by b ic y c le .
There is also c a f e & di n n ing by the la ke .
Some time , I take a hot d o g and a co up le of co f f e e .

H aving a l un ch in the at m o s p he re is very co m f or t able .
To day I come here to le ar n more about English writing s k i ll .
A l th ough I have st ud i ed English for many year s , writing a es s a y is hard for me .
So I think writing once a day can help my English ability .
I have see n some people di ar ies .
B y the way , if you have pro ble m s at C h in e se , I can help you .
M al e c at s K ur o ch an and D or a ch an dr in k the water in the bath t u b .

But they called off school because of ty p h o on .
My job sit u ation is becom ing bu s y again re c ent ly so I called b a b y sit ter to day .
To day was o k , because I was able to be back in home e ar l i er than I thought .
I could n ' t re a ch home before 9 p m almost while that time and had to re ly on be b y sit ter every day .
And now , my job is becom ing bu s y again ( even gradua l ly ) and I ' m pretty sure that I ' ll be much bu s y this s um m er .
But this is the my way , I ch o o se it by myself so I never be able to give up .
This year I ga in two sp e c i al ti c ke t s for mi n at o - ku re s id ence people .
So , we could sit sea t in front of f i re w or k s .
It was so beautiful one and w or th to see every year ! !
O f course , I was free there f or e I was take n to there .
It is a ma in place where mo un tain game s will take place in 2 0 1 0 V an c o u ver O ly m p ic .
Even bu il d ing s in W h is t l er V i ll age were beautiful .
It was like C an ad a that I im age d before I came to C an ad a , or more .
I enjoy ed very much .
To day , I went to help the de l ive ry of f ur n i ture .
I got a hu g e mi r r or so dis po s ed .
I place the mi r r or on my desk back soon .
I like this s i z e ! !
B e c a us e the room appear large r in the mi r r or effect .
But , It ' s too big for my desk .
I have to find good way . . . . .
I think the e ar th qu a ke will c al m down if there not coming large after qu a ke s .
But the a c c id ent of n u c le ar p l ant is too much serious .
O ur J a p an have de v a st at ed t w ic e of at o m ic bo m b s .
However now F U K I S H I M A n u c le ar p l ant go bad .
I think may b e there will be after - the - fact re p or t .
The me l t down was happen ed .
but we must so l ve it .
To day , I got bo n us .
I have some idea to sp en d money .
But I can ` t de s id e w th at to sp en d it .
I want to bu y a i po d us ic play er .
I want to take a f l ow er es s en se se m in ar .
But it is ex p en s ive se m in ar .
I like play it .
I want to eat s us h i ` s full .
It ' s 5 am now , but I still stay up .

H ot so y m il k usual ly help s me to sleep , but the so y m il k ma g ic did n ' t work to day .
I must be sleep y when I have to go .
C o ul d you let me know how to sleep well ?
No w , I have to in c re a se my English s k i ll because it is es s ent i al for the co ll e g e entrance ex a m in ation .
The co ll e g e I want to ent er de m and very f le x i ble English s k i ll .
But I was not hard le ar n er , so I can not write English sen t ence s f l u ent ly .
B y the way , I think it ' s very s il ly to le ar n another language just for pass ing the ex a m .
I can in t ro d u ce some of J a p an e se things if you write as a commen t .
I ' m glad if you c or re c t my sen t ence s very str ic t ly because I re ally want to write in English quite natural ly .
A new se m s ter !
To m or r ow a new se m s ter will begin .
A fter one and a half year I will gradua te from my co ll e g e .
I have p re p ar ed to take the I E L T S ex a m in M a y .
But one of my friend think I should take B E C first , and then finish the I E L T S in J u ly or A u g ust .
B e c a us e B E C is good for job hu n ting .
No w I have no idea what should I do .
C an you give me some suggest ion s , my de ar friend s ? I am re ally con f us ed now .
It was hard to set up unti l I could print out a 1 p age .
It took a long er time more than I expect ed .
I us ed to us e it easy .
B a c k then , it was n ' t take s time long unti l I could print it out .
It is hard to keep up with new te ch no l o g y .
A fter this , I will play hand b a ll ! !
And I left a ho s p it al yesterday .
A c c id ent : (
I f e ll over by b ic y c le on my way home .
I have never f al le n down by s c o o ter so it was been a long time since I have hu r t myself .
How the a c c id ent has happen ed is I was ri d ing along a ro ad but then the ro ad dis a p pe ar ed so I had to go over to a c ar ri age way , there was a small s te p , I tri ed to s te p over but I could n ' t since I was going kind of per p en d ic ul ar to the ro ad and t um ble d over with the b ic y c le .
I s c r a p ed my k ne es and el b ow s p l us , got b l u es .
However In some way , I think I was l u c k y , it could be w or se .
I am glad there was no c ar coming behind me .
I re m e m b er when I was little , I hu r t myself ex a c t ly the same way .
B ic y c le is da ng er ous .
My b ic y c le ' s hand le b ar b ent , so I had to keep it di a g on ally to keep going straight .
The w ound is not too bad but I was a b it e m b ar r as s ed .
Even the small s te p s s c ar ed me and I was ri d ing very care ful ly .
It has a long time I did n ' t write an ent ry and now I ' m here again .
I been stop p ing le ar n ing K or e an for a number of week s already .
The se days I just re al i z ed that I should le ar n my E N G L I S H !
I ' m f i g ur ing out what ' s wrong with my English .
F or the past f e w week s , I been play ing a we b s ite called O m e g le .
It ' s a we b s ite who is r and o m let you talk to strange r s .
It let s me know my English le ve l .
I can not understand English N at ive S pe a k er s .
I think that ' s a l ot of s la ng inside their con ver s ation s .
D o you think I talk to them will im p ro ve my English s k i ll s ? ?
So I know No r th K or e a has been ma k ing n u ke we a p on ! ! !
And I watch ed on T V that U S j er n al is t s were de tain ed in No r th K or e a .
They did n ' t know the sit u ation there ?
j er n al is t s are so c r a z y that go to da ng r ous place s , even though there is po s s i b il ity to di e .
I respect them , but I will never go to w ar place ! ! !
I s it K or e a or J a p an ?
O r are they bra ve enough to at ta c k U S direct ly ?
A n y way no country is interest ed in P h il i p p in es , so . . . .
What a pe a ce ful world here ! ! ! ! !
I heard there are some p ir ate s in the P h il i p p in es , and they kid n a p people and k i ll them .
M a y b e b and it too .
I think he live in my house . . .
`` You have your who le live a head of you ``
That is one person ' s w or d which I ' ve just got when I as k something about live in a little while a g o .
I some time feel in se c ur e about my way if I should get things going whether or not .
I kind of he s it ate to do .
In that time , some on e give me a s up p or t ive small push in right way .
I wish I could become like one of them some day .
I went to the l i b r ar y near my comp an y , in the l un ch time .
I read some ma g a z in es , about fashion , money , mo ter c y c le and so on .
This l i b r ar y is the big g est in my c ity , so many b ook s in there .
I found the b ook in A m a z on sit e , so I want to r ent the b ook tomorrow .
Yes ter day I me t a friend who st ud ies law in my un ive r s ity .
He called me on the p h on e when I was eat ing l un ch in c amp us .
In the after no on , We me t at a c a f e in front of s st ation near my un ive r s ity .
He see m s to me that he want some on e he can talk without any con st r a in t .
L a w is not my f i el d , but soon I re al i z ed I ' m interest ed in it , es pe c i ally when he talk ed about a re l ation s h i p between c ri m in al law and p s y ch i at ry .
He looked like enjoy ing himself by talk ing his matter of conc er n .
It see m s that high school life is not far behind , those ha p p y moment s o c c ur to me all the time .
I was like what if I could stay at that time for ever , but I know my mind now have change d a l ot .
And I would n ' t have thought I would go this far .
A ll I ' m think ing now is how I can get a good , pro m is ing job , im p ro v ing myself , so c i al i z ing with other people and get ting my English , es pe c i ally or al English , even better .
And I think it ' s quite a long time that I did n ' t po st any English ar t ic le on the we b s ite , and it might be the be st time for me to p r a c t ic e my second language by us ing L an g - 8 .
I would for ce myself to write something in English every day .
T h an k U ! !
I ' m going to speak about me in English at 1 0 P M .
So , I will write what I ' m go n d to say .
I ra n a full m ar a th on two week s a g o .
It was n ' t T O K Y O mar a th on .
I talk with my friend s on S k y pe l ate ly .
I ' m re ally glad to j o in this gr o up .
I felt bad because I am not us ed to accept ex p en s ive g if t s from people .
In the morning and night , t w ic e !
I was re ally tired and felt down .
I re m e m b er ed my teacher told us this when I was a high school st ud ent , he said : `` One of the most ha p p i ness is that you have a work for your living , and you re ally like it . `` I did n ' t understand at that time .
I thought I would n ' t do anything if I dis like it .
As other almost C h in e se students , I off er ed too many time to le ar n for the un ive r s ity entrance ex a m in ation .
L u c k i ly , I entered a good un ive r s ity and after gradua tion , I get a job in a comp an y .
But the pro ble m is I do n ' t like my work .
I never try to do anything be s id es le ar n ing know led g e for the ex a m .
I do n ' t even know what I re al like .
So my co w or k er and I went to b ar r a k s for c he c k ing two of the room s .
H or ri ble .
F il th y room s are c le an now .
To day is hot in J a p an . . .

When I ar ri v ed at C op le y , I ' d n a ver see n a t re m en d ous am o un t of people at there .
I thought all the people in B o st on came to down t ow n yesterday .
To make matter w or se , the we a ther was so hot . . .
This was the first time watch ing a p ar ad e in B o st on , even I ' m not a big f an of the ic e - ho c ke y , It was a w es ome .

H i , This is the first time to write di ar y on la ng - 8 .
I would like to im p ro ve my English for my future !
I have never st ud i ed history since I was j un i or high school st ud ent .
I felt as ha m ed because I know less about J a p an e se history than A m er ic an friend .
I think that many you ng J a p an e se do n ' t know about history .
We do n ' t know about own country and for e i g n country .
T h ough It take s 5 hour s to go to H i ro s h im a , I ' m very ex cited .
E at ing L o c al F o o d s

It is so difficult that I am so dis a p po in t ment .

To day , when I as le e p in after no on , I had a bad dr e a m .
It is very ter ri ble .

I always try to write something but I have very difficult y sp e c i ally because of I do n ' t have who c or re c t me .
I ' m afraid to write wrong in face b ook and the people laugh .
English is not difficult but I con t in u e with f e w v o c a b ul ar y .
I took money from my pocket but it was 93 0 yen , so I was going to pay 1 1 0 yen from a my point c ar d of this came r a sh op but it was lack of 1 0 yen , so I had to give up on bu y ing one pack but I re ally want ed to bu y one more .

ha p y y day
to day is very ha p p y , b a c a us e my class was very funny .
They al way make me ha p p y .
One of my go al is co m m un ic at ing without pro ble m in English with the people who se mother language is English .
So , please do n ' t he s it ate to re v is e my poor English al th ough it ' s ti n y ti n y mistake , mi s us e , or n u ance pro ble m .
I believe there are kind people in this co m m un ity L an g - 8 and ho pe they will help me with English for im p ro v ing my English ability .
I study like this .
To day , I have the ch ance to speak English .
I think it is better to le ar n con ver s ation and know our c ul ture s than study v o c a b ul ar y .
So I want to watch mo v ies but it ` s too ex p en ive for me . . .
To day I thought about po st ing a v id e o from a F re n ch mo v i e , in which the scene take s place in H ar le m .
So the pro ta g on is t s speak English of course , and then every body could understand the v id e o , I do n ' t need to tra n s c ri b e or to tra n s l ate .
I in t ro d u ce a little b it the mo v i e : The mo v i e , take s place in the 1 9 8 0 s , it ' s a co m ic F re n ch mo v i e as they were very p op ul ar in F r ance .
The ma in character is play ed by M i ch el C o l u c c i a . k . a C o l u ch e , a very p op ul ar F re n ch hu m or is t ( one man show ) and act or .
In this mo v i e , the pro ta g on is t ( C o l u ch e ) works for an in s ur ance so c i e ty and have to tra ve l around the world to b r ing back the un l u c k y to ur is t s who have un f or t un ate ly had pro ble m s or a c c id ent s , in F r ance .
T h us , in the mo v i e , C o l u ch e tra ve l s around the world , and ex pe ri ence s some a d ve n ture s in va ri ous co un t ri es such as M ar o c c o , United - States ( H ar le m ) , C h in a and so on . . .
It ' s one of my favor ite F re n ch come d ies , I still laugh each time I watch it , even at this very moment writing the ent ry and listen ing to the ex t r a c t at the same time .
I think it may be interest ing to listen the F re n ch a c c ent and the ( may b e ex age r at ed ) view of H ar le m by the F re n ch at the time .
The man say s that N e w Y or k is very da ng er ous and w ar n s C o l u ch e to be care ful , es pe c i ally from the black people who at ta c k s the w h ite s .
C o l u ch e who was not afraid before he me t the man , is now very ten s ed and afraid . . .
And as k s him to go to H ar le m , but even the black tax i - dr ive r re f us es to go so far and leave s him close to the dis t ri c t .
And the v id e o begin s as we see him walk ing on the H ar le m de s er ted street s .
S ur p ri s ed to see that this same man was in b and age s and a p p ar ent ly in j ur ed .
He as k s him what happen ed , and the answer is that the man has been at ta c k ed ( if I re m e m b er well , I even think that he was at ta c k ed by w h ite me n . . .
W h i ch is funny as he only w ar n ed about the black s ) .
The reason is may b e I work ed in co l d st or e yesterday .
The be st d ur ing catch ing a co l d is eat ing well and sleep ing well .
My f a v o ur ite sea s on is s um m er , but not very hot .
No w in R us s i a is s um m er and it ' s a w ful ly hot ! ! ! We go to the ri ver almost every day , but even bath ing does n ' t re t re at me from the he at ! I ' ve never im a g in ed , that I will ho pe it will be w in ter now .
W in ter I l o ve too , but if you want to go for a walk in this sea s on , you will be able to we ar many c l o th es ! ! A ut um n . . .
I ha te a ut um n ! It ' s of ten ra in s , it ' s why you must n ' t go for a walk .
The s un s h in e is n ' t so hot , gra s s and leave s are gr e en , b ir d s are s ing ing . . .

It is very im p or t ant and very f a m ous which if you can t pass , you w on t get a s u it able job in ch in a .
It is for co ll e g e st ud ent .
Even though people s who have already gradua ted , they also take this ex a m , for ma k ing them more comp it it ive .
But act u ally , even people s have a b el ity to pass it , they could not co m m un ic ate well by e ng l ish .

However , It is found ed that Tokyo may be s a f e are a this week , so they try to come back J a p an .
I he ar that when they come back J a p an , they have pro ble m .
O ther work er s who did not leave in their comp an y were con t in u ing to work and they may be a ng ry .
In fact , they im po s ed their work to other work er , but I think s a f e is the most im p or t ant and they should be we l c ome d to their comp an y .

While I was sea r ch ing some i nformation about al ter n at ive en er g y for 5 minute s speech , a thought o c c ur r ed to me .
It is ne ce s s ar y that we us e another en er g y to de ve l op al ter n at ive en er g y .
In c a p it al is m , it is in e v it able that al ter n at ive en er g y become to be mean s for pro f it s .
So I think what we need now is not de ve l op ing en er g y but less con s um ing that .
In mo d er n so c i e ty , es pe c i ally in ur b an life , we have depend ant on en er g y too much .
F or ex amp le , when I come back home after work , I us e water and ga s en er g y to take a show er .
I s ur f the in ter ne t with an a ir - condition er and a f an turn on , after finish ing we b s ur f ing , I watch T V with the de st - to p still on and us e a st o ve and mi c r ow a ve to have a dinner .
B e f or e going to be d , I usual ly read a b ook listen ing to the m us ic unless I dr in k at the p u b .
I went thought black o ut once d ur ing stay ing in the P h il i p p in es .
I to t ally re al i z ed that how much I depend on en er g y .
D ar k ness made me a fool who could n ' t anything at all .
I was just sit ting in front of my la p t op in dark ness for a while .
N e x t thing I know , dark ness s ud d en ly came to me .
So I went outside f el ling my way .
I could n ' t nothing .
electronic de v ic es had n ' t been re ch ar g ed were us e less such as a la p t op , t v , m p 3 play er , even re f ri g er at or .
A ll I could do was dr in k be er going va p id in the f ri g er at or .
F o s s il f u el is limit ed and get ting ex ha ust ed .
There f or e we will de ve l op al ter n at ive en er g y some day .
But the en er g y it s el f will be me re ly a co m m o d ity to be so l d or b ough t in c a p it al is m .
We also made c ar b on d y x id e a co m m o d ity even se ll and bu y the right of e mission .
I think it ' s im po s s i ble that s us tain able de ve l op ment is re al i z ed .
The conc ept of s us tain able de ve l op ment must have been made by c a p it al is t s who want ed to le g it a m i z e much more de ve l op ment and ex p l o it ation .
D e ve l op ment and ex p l o it ation were already enough .
U n less we do so , we will be at ta c k ed on by nature like hu g e c l im ate change as much as we ex p l o it .
B e c a us e of the e ar ly a ir p la ne , I f a ll as le e p while the p la ne was f ly ing .
When I w o ke up , I heard a sound like g la s se s f e ll to the floor .
I re al i z ed that it was my g la s se s , but I could not see where they are after to u ch ing for a while .
al th ough I even did not know who he like s .
He was very friend ly brought it to me ,
then I not ic ed he was looked like a gentle man with full of understand ing ,
as same as my age , may b e ? we ar ing a g la s se s .
A fter con t in u ing ex p l or at or y talk s , we found that each er other act u ally pro d u c ed a good impress ion , because we enjoy ed our talk ing , we had a re ally n ic e time , we will be close friend s in the life .
I think o il sp i ll a c c id ent in the g ul f of me x ic o is very im p or t ant thing in the world .
D e p en d ing on a case , I think it is more im p or t ant than the e c on o m ic pro ble m or the re l i g ion or the w ar or the po ver ty or any other pro ble m .
because It affect s the who le world , no body know s a so l u tion , no body are p r ed ic t able .
But We hard ly he ar the new s about a c c id ent on T V in J a p an .
You guy do re ally speak like that ! ?
`` We st of mo un tain s are b ro ad and f a ir ly f l at p la in s . ``
I can understand the mean ing of it , but I s it a w k w ar d for the English read er or l is t n er ?
e ng l is again !
I tell to my se le f again and again after an e ng l ish le c ture every time : I must le ar n e ng l ish now !
it ' s re ally look s n ic e here .
I have sen t many me s s age s to strange r s who speak e ng l ish .
I ho pe their re p ly .
I ha te e ng l ish , because I le ar n it for e i g h t year s , but I c a n ' t listen a le c ture well , and I c a n ' t read an e ng l ish paper well .
I re ally need this language too l to pro ve my work .
so , I ho pe e ng l ish speak er s to be my friend s .
So I think it ' s me m or able to keep something down here .
I have to a d m it age is a becom ing more and more sen s it ive as I get old er and old er , and the old er I got , the more respon s i b l ity come s along and the more ma ture you should be ha ve .
Well , I think I wish I could we l c ome the moment at home as usual y , but I f a il ed for the last con p le of days which f l ash ed through so quick ly in a no r ther n c ity I have never been to before .
T r a ve ll ing make s the time e la p se so quick y that I have hard ly any time to di g est the change of age sat is f a c t or i ly , Even though I have been able to come back home this morning , I still c a n ' t take my time and am act u ally str u g g ling to keep a w a ke to di g est it as much as I can , because I hard ly sleep yesterday .
n ' t tell other s , o k a y ?
- D a i k on - O ro s h i is a m ash ed J a p an e se w h ite ra d ish .
He got a ng ry and s w un g his k it ch en k n if e , his d aught er re s is ted with her can e and es c a p ed .
And then the police c aught him in the act of do ing it .
He said that my d aught er at e my D a i k on - O ro s h i in re f ri g er at or without my per mission , so I got up se t ,
I did n ' t in ten d to k i ll her all along , just for a th re at . . .
My new friend s who they come from U S A .
I was suppose to very n er v ous , because my English is n ' t well , I was afraid that I could n ' t express well in English .
That right , I should be about to b re a k through myself .
To day is ho l i day .
J a p an have `` B on va c ation `` .
D o you know B on va c ation ?
A l m o st people are ho l i day d ur ing B on va c ation .
B on va c ation is ance st or w or s h i p day .
But I am work ing d ur ing B on va c ation .
So I re st to day al ter n at ive to B on va c ation .
The comp an y is about tra d ing .
There are many things to ex p or t es pe c i ally f o o d s .
My bo s s went of sit e of the comp an y at the moment .
I re ally hung ry .
I want to have b an an a .
In the picture .
It is a s amp le for se ll .
But It look re ally n ic e and s m e ll good .
My bo s s always tell us do n ' t eat the s amp le because he have to us e it for ex b i tion ( I mean to show in some where ) .
But I c a n ' t p at i ent .
I found it ter ri ble when I had the first sp a g he t t i in U K .
It was bo il ed for too long time and too so f t for me .
M or e o ver , I felt bad when I b ough t a can of sp a g he t t i and had it because g el ly sp a g he t t i appeared and I regard ing that can as a can of me at s a u ce .
In J a p an the far e a st country , we did n ' t know al de n te in the past .
that ' s because we have tra d i tion al noodle s , which are U d on and So b a , which are b as ic ally bo il ed ti ll their co re were bo il ed .
However , we know that ' s far better to have sp a g he t t i in that way now a day s .
Why is n ' t al de n te that co m m on in this E ur op i an country who se people are most o m n i v or ous .

I made a t w it ter account .

E a st M on ke y .
I think I understand their va l u e , but they look s that they do n ' t understand other va l u e of me .
I know it ' s re ally small thing , but I also feel this ti n y ga p de f in ite ly ex is t s .
As you know , I ' m a kind of person who is so ' easy ' .
B e ing easy is good point , but it make me w an n a di e .
I do n ' t know how to es c a pe from this guy I have live d for 2 2 year s .
The thing I re ally ha te is p r ed ic t able future .
There is no op tion not us ing this ch ance .
I can stay here only 3 month more .
How could I understand it . G ive me more i nformation .
K or e a have very tra g ic mo d er n history .
The c a p it al is m side and the co m m un is m side b ro ke into w ar .
To day , I found one new s ar t ic le .
No r th K or e a began large con st r u ction pro j e c t in P y on g y an g .
I do n ' t understand how it can do
I write a paper , please help me c or re c t it .
T h an k you very much !
In s te ad of re p ly ing each , I than k you all for c or re c ting on this di ar y .
I ' ll have mi d - ter m ex a m .
I have to re m e m b er l ot s of dr u g s name for
and the class is ed u c at ed by English .
J a p an has a big pro ble m which J a p an had a big e ar th qu a ke .
So I have to end ur e many things because many people s u f f er .
I feel s that the sp r ing have ar ri v ed here over night , for the simple reason that the te m p er a ture in re c ent days even ri se to 2 0 de g re e d ur ing the day .
however , there was a he a v y s n ow on 1 2 n d , a p ri l last year and the s n ow re m a in ed unti l the end of the month .
but so far , only a little part of s n ow in the corner where the s n ow she l ter ed from sh in ing direct ly in the day .
A ccord ing to the n at ive s , they had even ex pe ri ence d s n ow ing in may when they were you ng .
now the we a ther is becom ing more and more ex t re m e ly .
I b ough t a N e w L a p t op to day .
B e c a us e My P C was B ro k en .
I will take a less on of English on S k y pe this week en d .
But just now I try to he ar my voice on S k y pe .
I could take a less on s m o o th ly this week en d .
I want to write my p l o f i le first .
I listen to [ the G a z e t te ] and [ Ka la f in a ] well .
And I like R or il it a fashion !
T h an k you read me !
The p ri m ar y reason that I watch ed this mo v i e because I just want ed to re la x for a little b it after knew we still c a n ' t get the an n u al bo n us again this year .
P l us , the mo v i e scene inside look s could n ' t be better .
This mo v i e is talk ing about two different A m er ic an girl s sp ent their s um m er to B ar ce l on a where they have a ro man t ic , un f or g e t t able a d v an ture .
M e al w h i le , they are still le ar n ing how to face some sub j e c t in their life .
M o v i e ' s s i p ri t see m s give us a po s s i b il ity that everything is possible , es pe c i ally re l ate to l o ve .
When it came s to sub j e c t to the l o ve , some people ten d to re l is t ic , some people are always expect something very different .
I can understand how ' s feel when people want to cha se , find something in their life , but do n ' t know what ' s ex a c t ly purpose .
There f or e , what ever what kind of life you want , it ' s our ch o ic e .
But I think most people in our country , we do n ' t have enough en c o ur age to change the sit u ation , or some time s we just c ar ry more mo r al re s p n s i b il ity .
O ur sp a ce is near the sea and the st ation , and when I ar ri v ed there , there were some friend s .
And we had wait ed while eat ing and dr in k ing for start ing the f i re w or k s show . . .
We have been tired , but when we watch ed them , we for g ot our f at i gue .
The f i re w or k s was the most be a ut if l which I had watch ed ever .
P le a se watch them with my picture ^ ^ In fact , more beautiful ! !
O r , I we ar ed a y u k at a for a long time so I was ha p p y .
I say about my f un .
My f un is to watch favor ite T V pro g r a m s .
So when I come home about all pro g r a m s I want to watch has done .
As I re c or d pro g r a m s to my B l u - ra y dis k .
In re c ent days I ' ll write about my favor ite pro g r a m s .
Some un ive r s ity students find they be ne f it from part - time work while other s say that work ing even part - time would p re v ent them from ma k ing the most of their st ud ies . D is c us s the me ri t s of both ar g u ment s . With which point of view do you agree with regard to your country and why ?
Some students need to find job for living , but other s have ch o ic e if they work or no for ex t r a money .
A l s o some of them say work would o b st a c le for their study .
But I agree with that students do part - time even in J a p an .
So they do not need to work , though they still need some ex t r a money for c l o th da ting and so on .
I think there are f e w students who work for living co st like f o o d s , house r ent , ut il ity b i ll .
That s why it see m s un ne ce s s ar y ex pe ri ence .
C o op er ation s k i ll is very im p or t ant , so if they w o n ' t do any job while they are st ud ent , after gradua te they may face some difficult y such as re la ted with so c i al and co p ing s k i ll in the future .
A l s o they would know how time is p re c i ous and en h ance their time man age ment s k i ll .
In conc l us ion , part - time job is be ne f ic i al but students should n ' t sp en d too much time for a little ex t r a money .
I he ar new s that one of old est and most f a m ous re st a ur ant s in R ome was p un ish ed with s us p en d ing business op er ation because they dis h on est ly charge d a J a p an e se co up le about 7 0 0 E ur o s for l un ch .
They can not speak It al i an or English , but their J a p an e se hotel own er went to the police with them and claim ed it .
I was surprise d that they pai d it with their credit c ar d !
If I were them , I would make comp la in t in English , any way .
But they might th re a ten me or p re ten d not understand ing English . . . .
What can I do ? ? ?
P ' P un suggest ed this sit e to me and I re ally a p p re c i at ed him . .
ha ha ho pe he did n ' t see this .
there are so m th ing that we need to re m e m b er , while there are something that we need to for g e t , and we had better not re m e m b er again .
try to for g e t some body who just my life ' s gue st , they just live d in my pass ed life .
they would not come again .
tea r can get people ' s sympath i z e , also can make myself feel good , but I do n ' t like it .
tea r s show ing that I am we a k , I never will ing other people find my tea r s .
so the se un ha p p y things also would los e to g h ter with time .
It ' s M a y now , but is too hot .
To day , we had V ER Y long meeting . . .
It took over 2 hour s , and it was so b or ing that many of us s l ept : - P
A fter that , I tri ed to f i x bu g on my so f t w ar e .
I go o g led 3 or 4 hour s and f in ally I could f i x the bu g ! !
It see m s that there is no J a p an e se I nformation about the bu g , so If I can have time , I write an ar t ic le about that .
We live a re g ul ar life us ing clock s .
G e t ting up in the morning , G o ing to work , B a c k ing to home , G o ing to be d in the night .
But I of ten dr e a m the life without clock s .
I think that It might be a life of we al th .
My bo s s is go off ic i al to ur to day .
So .
I am a free in the mo r in ing .
But t est is next week .
B y the way , I s there the dr i ll that as s um es e ar th qu a ke ?
As for the dr i ll of J a p an , e ar th qu a ke s are more than f ir es , because J a p an o c c ur s of many e ar h qu a ke .
There is this language in J a p an .
`` A e ar th g u a ke , A thunder , A f i re , A father ``
The se are all s c ar ed .
If there are mistake s in my sen t ence , please tell me .
A ccord ing to the we a ther for e c a st , it ' s going to s n ow tomorrow .
I think w in ter is sure ly coming .
I ' m p l an n n ing to go to S a p po ro ( a c a p it al of H o k k a id o , J a p an ) this week en d and I feel un e as y to go through the pass because it ' s very da ng er ous to dr ive on the ic y ro ad .
A c t u ally , I ' ve never go ne through the pass in this sea s on of the year .
I ho pe that nothing will happen .
The th ir d and four th gra d e class are s us p en d ed as well as the first gra d e class .
T h an k you f o y read ing and for your c or re ction s .
A ll most of J a p an e se people are cha ng ing there ' s dress for the sea s on in O c t or b er .
I want to eat something the J a p an e se s te w s when it is get ting co l d .
I made `` O D E N `` a f e w days before .
O D E N is one of the f a m ous of J a p an e se s te w s in w in ter .
I l o ve it , because my body becom ing w ar m and he al th y .
W o ul d you tell me what f o o d s do you eat the co l d day in your country ?
I ' m a ng ry to my father ! !
I made some mistake s but every on e expect for my father said it was good .
They were re ally kind .
My father , however , said `` O h , this mo ch i is re ally hard like a stone . `` as soon as he at e .
While I c ook ed , he just s l ept .
He should help or say nothing .
S in ce f ri day , when ever I turn ed on A / C , some we ir d and loud no is e came from the front part of the c ar where an e ng in e is l o c at ed .
But , I still could he ar very in ter r up ting and worry ing no is e from A / C .
To m or r ow is s un day , so I do n ' t think they will open their business .
I ho pe It w o n ' t co st me a l ot .
I will po st a picture of S po t tomorrow with some writing , yet , right now , I ' m so tired and want to go sleep .
I feel so tri ed , I had to finish my home w or k , but I think it ' s all right that I can finish my home w or k at the end of this ho l i day .
but my p ar ent s did n ' t , think so , they think I finish my work and I will le ar n something else .
so many work , how long can I finish it ? ? ? ! ! !
I de c id e to go on a di e t .
I went to G u an g Z h o u a f e w days a g o , in t ro some kind of di m s um for a S ha ng H a i friend .
She l o ve s it so much .
My favor ite D im S um is L i u S ha B a o , co l d c a ke , and ch ic k en feet !

I want ed to be friend s , but I could n ' t .
I was sh y and could n ' t find the reason to talk with her .
My bo y f ri en d and I are going to a sh ri ne to p r a y for our he al th of this year .
We are sp en d ing a very re la x ing time in our ho l i day .
I wish I can take good care of our family F in an c i al man age ment .
I get a part of our s a ve s to st ock mar ke t .
so , if I have free time s I conc er n st ock mar ke t i nformation .
When ever I think about job - hu n ting , I feel so o o o an x i e ty .
I want be a ch il d re n for ever . . .
I s this P at er P an s y n d r ome ?
I think a de f in ation of a d ul t is different in the world .
But may b e there will be many country s that de f in ate `` a d ul t `` more e ar ly age .
No w I ' m 1 8 year s old , so I ' m a d ul t po s s i b ly in other country .
My comp le x ion are get ting better comp ar ed to other sea s on s .
No other than mo s qu it o es .
D e ar mo s qu it o , do you re ally think my b l o o d is more y um m y than other s ?
I ' m already get ting t u c k ed at a great de al of mo s qu it o b ite s .
I even dr e ame d that mo s qu it o es at ta c k ed me serious ly like `` the B ir d s `` by H it ch c ock .
I make up my mind to take a ction s for it .
I do n ' t like to be a p ow er less v ic t im from mo s qu it o es .
I ' m w re st ling with the idea s so as to pro te c t me from them .
B as ic ally , it is said J a p an e se pe a p le are not good at speak ing English .
We begin e to le ar n it since j un i or high s c o o l .
And if we go to un ive r s ity , per i o d We le ar n is 1 0 year s .
my name is o an h ch a u , im from v i e t n a m , my language is v i e t n ame s ,
this is the first time s I write my j o ur n al s on the in ter ne t , act u ally my

N e x t month I p l an ing to get some re st at s n ow y mo un tain s .
U n f or t un ate ly I could not it d ur ing the new year ' s ce le b r ation s with my friend s because of my i ll ness .
But now , after ex a m s I must have some fresh high l and a ir .
There is a s k i re s or t in my town , but to my re g re t I have got to know about it at last year .
O ver there s n ow b o ar d is p op ul ar est , but I have ch o s en it not for this reason .
I have ex pe ri ence of many year s in s k i , but I never s n ow b o ar d ed .
Well , I wait for the end of this month and for good we a ther now .
The be st tra d i tion al per u v i an f o o d of all the place s I ' ve already at e .
It ' s l o c at ed in the S an M ar t in 1 0 6 2 a ve n u e P u e b l o L i b re .
P ar t ic ul ar ly , they have a great and good va ri e ty of f o o d , a big me n u of tra d i tion al me al s and dis he s such as p a p a re ll en a , ce v ic he , but if ar r a and one of the most f a m ous is `` ch or it o s a la cha la c a `` .
The who le place has an str u c ture of our co l on i al time !
I think is one of the only place s in the c a p it al c ity that ma in tain s the se tra d i tion s .
In s id e of the re st a ur ant , you will see many picture s about the time when this place was under con st r u ction , picture s of our first mo n or a il , the first c ar s in per u , e t c .
The wait er s are a b it old but they are re ally good .
I feel very p le as ant every time I go there , you c a n ' t not only find out about our f o o d , but also you can find out a little b it about our history !
and there are a l ot of for e i g n er s going there as well .
The p ri ce it ' s quite normal and I find it reason able since they c ook very well . .
I would like to re c o m m en d this re st a ur ant for all the to ur is t s who are coming to visit P er u , if you p l an to f i ll your st o m a ch with something tra d tion al , f a st , un i qu e and good with such a an c i ent place like this , do n ' t he s is t ate and go find it out for your own .
I ' m w ri t ting my first po st , and I need to your help to ex p l or e my e ng l ish .
My friend R a f a el , said in one of his last s po st , that he only can study in a per f e c t not e b ook .
He ' s a very funny guy , and I me e t him when we was only five year s old unti l now .
U n t il th is start year , he was my class m ate , and he suggest ed me this we b s ite .
In my point of view , it ' s a compli c ate we b s ite , but I think if I p r a c t ic e , I can us e so go o s this sit e , and f in ally re a ch my o b j e c .

I sp e ed ed up the ro ad ty ing to catch up my friend ' s c ar .
I did not see a police c ar was behind me .
I re al i z ed that ' s why every on e was dr i v ing so s l ow .
E s pe c i ally , I like watch ing E ur up e so c c er !
He de f e at ed a bu l ly
When some bu ll ies walk ed up to him to bu l ly him yesterday , he s ud d en ly de f e at ed the bo s s of them by a p un ch in his st o m a ch .
H on est ly , I was glad to he ar that from my so n and I am pro ud of him .
I thought that my so n got the piece school life for a while .
No w a day s I think a l ot of things .
M a y b e f in al t est is coming soon .
I ro d e his mo t or c y c le .
And he took me many place s that I ' ve never been .
R id ing mo t or c y c le was not as s c ar y as I thought .
I heard he has n ' t girl f ri en d .
To day I will going to me e t my friend s who study with me in un ive r s ity .
We will me e t at 6 P .
M and have dr in k some l i qu or .
I think I w o n ' t come to my home to day .
I like to take home sick k it ten s to treat their i ll ness .
M o st k it ten s are over ly i ll and di ed f e w days la ter .
My c at is the only k it ten that gr ow s to a d ul th o o d .
I want ed to a d op t him but I do n ' t have a sp a ce for two c at s .
I bath him every day because he has th ic k la y er of f le as .
A fter a f e w days , his eyes are get ting better but he ' s still th in .
This no on , when I c he c k ed how he was do ing , his bo x was e m p ty .
The house m a id said , that he went to the ver and a , j um p ed from the second floor , and es c a p ed through the front ga te .
It see m s like the s um m er is back .
The te m p er a ture in the day time is more than 3 0 de g re es .
However , it is co o l er in the morning and even ing with p le as ant a ut um n b re e z e .
We also feel p le as ant b re e z e in the sha d e even in the day time .
D ur ing the c y c ling , I stop p ed at some l o c al public f a c il ity ,
where many t re k k er s took a re st .
I wonder ed why so many people were walk ing there that I asked one of them .
She told me that this f a c il ity was one of c he c k po in t s of O x f a m T r a il w al k .
A c t u ally the c he c k po in t I saw yesterday was that for 8 0 k m .
She said that they were w al ing another 2 0 k m for the re st of the day .
This even t is also f un d - ra is ing even t .
as they might f e ar the n u c le ar c ri s is and after s h ock of the 3 . 1 1 e ar th qu a ke .
Some w or e T - shirt s on which some en c o ur a g ing me s s age s for J a p an were written .
It is four th time for her to part ic i p ate the O ly m p ic game .
The re s ul t of her first o ly m p ic in N a g an o J a p an , was the 7 th place , the second ' s one in s al t la ke c ity U .
He r perform ance and condition were better than she was and other play er s , but the re s ul t was 4 th place .
I was ho p ing she would be a me d al is t .
A fter the game she said `` I could n ' t re a ch the me d al but I did it and I did my be st . ``
That made me think I would s up p or t her ever though I am not ur e that she will con t in u e to play mo g ul .
A n y w an y , I think it ' s going to be an ex c it i g O ly m p ic .
If you want to le ar n J a p an e se , I will ing to help as much as possible .
I enjoy school f est i v al from O c t o b er 9 th to 1 1 th .
There is a conc er t , and I play the T ro m b on e .
M an y people came to look our conc er t , so I was very ha p p y .
I think I will be very hard for next conc er t .
I write easy and short sen t ence this time .
I will write more difficult ( conc re te ) and long sen t ence next .
To day I had a English meeting with three re p re s ent at ive s of our comp an y c ust ome r s .
I me t three co ll e a gue s in Tokyo st ation then head ed to U t s un o m i y a st ation where we were going to me e t them .
I was a little b it n er v ous yesterday so called my mo m to as k her the point s I have to keep in mind in the business meeting in English .
M o st J a p an e se do n ' t understand the b as ic conc ept of `` sha ke hand s , `` She said .
H u g e e ar th qu a ke and t s un a m i have at ta c k ed my p re f e c ture
I could not believe my eyes at all when I saw that on T V .
B e c a us e now I live in T ha il and .
So it is in c on ve n i ent to get the p re c is e i nformation .
I went for a dr in k with my co ll e a gue and watch ed a B B C pro g r a m .
What I saw there , is an at ro c i ous scene .
L ar g e am o un t of c ar s , house s , people had f l o at ed .
W a ll s and sign b o ar d s had f e ll .
The w or th things , the f o c us of the e ar th qu a ke is near my house .
My mother and my s is ter still live there .
And a p ar t from them , my father and you ng er brother also is in the p re f e c ture .
There f or e I called with my ce ll p h on e to them .
I was so w or ri ed about of them .
I can not help stop p ing to see in ter ne t to get any i nformation .
F or ex amp le , ust re a m , t w it ter , face b ook
She said they are all s a f e and stay at home to g e ther now .
I felt re l i e v ed a little .
the da m age of n u c le ar is so ter ri ble .
A ll I have to do is to p r a y for their s a f e ty .
To day I got a p h on e call that M r s hu an g as k s me to in ter v i e w in her comp an y .
It ' s th ir d call s unti ll this moment , but I did n ' t go any on e .
Some time I re g re t my de c is ion , but I have no way because of my st ud ies .
I do n ' t per p ar e for it ent i re ly .
I do n ' t know how to dress up and how to de al with one and one hard question s that I can n ' t answer .
No w , I ' m con f us ed .
I ` m co ll e g e st ud ent and I live dormitory .
D or m it or y have c ur f e w .
So even If I ` m hung ry , I don ` t go to a s up er m ar ke t to bu y f o o d .
But I ` m hung ry now .
We went to to b o g g an to the hi ll in my ne i g h b or h o o d .
This is my first time to try to to b o g g an , al th ough I have s k i ed or s n ow b o ar d ed .
That was so s c ar y !
A t first I saw it light ly and I thought it is the sp or t just for kid s .
It is like co aster s .
The more it went down , the more sp e ed it got .
The sp e ed is out r age ous .
Besides I could n ' t con t ro l well .
I act u ally str o ke on a ch il d re n .
F or t un ate ly she did n ' t hu r t , but my mind went b l an k at the moment .
I a d m ir ed ch il d re n because they have no f e ar .
I gue s s there are a l ot of op p or t un ity to to b o g g an here and I have to im p ro ve it for not be be a ten by ch il d re n .
I consider ably got dr un k .
I will sleep a head of time to day .
It is far more difficult than we think to be ha ve like that way .
B e c a us e en se m ble require s co op er ation , listen ing to other is very im p or t ant .
It also a p p l ies to da i ly con ver s ation s .
It was n ' t finish .
I ' ll try next day .
he y ~
this is an ne who keep listen ing 5 7 5 by per f um e ( j a p an e se ar t is t ) the se days .
first I went to v i ll age va ng u ar d which is a b ook st or e .
this is one of the most k a w a i i and us e ful b ook st or es ive ever been .
and I had a b an an a t ar t with c re a m and a c up of so y l at te .
I wish that place was no n - s m or k ing place and
I wish I could stay more . . .
( you have to or d er more if you want to stay there over 2 hour s . . . )
and this is a kind of b ook c a f e so
so many b ook s are there .
I read the b ook of mo v i e qu ot es ( interest ing )
am a a a a a z in n ng and made me c ry .
this is me and this is a day of ot a ku - girl .
As you know , e c on o m y sit u ation is get ting w or se es pe c i ally c ar in d ust ry includ ing U S and K or e a .
I have to s a ve money if bu y a c ar . . . ^ ^
I ' m ha p p y to know this sit e .
I ' ll try to write a di ar y and c or re c t a some on e ' s di ar y every day .
I am t est ing whether L an g - 8 has re ally become f aster after it s ma in ten ance and I think it is work ing just fine .
The access sp e ed is very c ri t ical for an S N S and I re ally a p p re c i ate the effort which the s ta f f has made so far .
No w I can keep my language p r a c t ic es .
I was think ing about c re ate pro x y that is difficult .
but to day , I w ro te it .
like p ic e of c a ke .
but us e that co d e , I can access that U R L .
That me ch an is m is , When I a c c se s s `` U R L `` , pro x y respon ce `` U R L `` .
normal y , A j a x can not cross sit e .
but , but us e this me ch an is m , per ha p s , I can do it .
He ll o , I ' m a new here .
But then I re al i z ed it was the interest ing one ; there f or e , I have re g is ter ed here .
P e op le say I ' m ma k ing a big pro g re s s , but I do n ' t think so .
B e c a us e my spoke n English is still poor .
I of ten talk to n at ive speak er s , but as a matter of fact , I do n ' t understand them too much .
Yes ter day , the ra in y sea s on began at K y us y u dis t ri c t , which is l o c at ed to so u th w est er n part of J a p an .
It will begin at all part of the country in the next f e w days .
I do n ' t like this sea s on because it is difficult to go out at a ra in y day .
But you can see beautiful h y d r an g e a at the ra in y sea s on in J a p an .
My ha ir is di v id ed on the left side .
When I put down my ha ir , it is about the le ng th to my middle back .
I am p l an n ing to gr ow it long er be st to my l ow er back .
I us ed to we ar bang .
S in ce I was told to re ve al my for e head to have better l u c k , I gr e w the front ha ir and p u ll it to the side .
That sh op always put a f l ow er in a big va se .
To day ' s f l ow er was `` f o x face `` .
My friend is a tea ther of j un i or co ll e g e .
D o you think that ?
I thought a little , and I answer d .
She smile d in agreement , and s i p p ed the hot co f f e e .
I ' m not go to school
because ce re m ome y of my school open n ing
I go to l i b r a y and study hard
and go to a c ad e m y
To day is a ho l i y day .
I was very sick , th ur s day .
But I am not went to the ho s p it al .
I am very felt bad .
I am feel so good .
yesterday , my be st friend was b ir th day .
I b ough t a clock and ha ir d ry .
I does went to dr ive d a c ar .
We are the part y .
I could n ' t go to A k it a to enjoy them but I watch ed T V .
As of yet I have n ' t see n the f i re w or k s neither T V no r re al one .
B e c u a se they are so beautiful with be a ut i ul m us ic .
In the train , a high school st ud ent sit down on a cha ir .
In front of him , an el d er ly woman appeared .
He said to her ' S it down , please . '
But she de c line d that propos al so he felt e m b ar as s ed and p ity to say so .
A week la ter , a head of el d er ly man , the st ud ent become to sit down without saying anything .
What would you do in that sit u ation if you were the st ud ent ?
But you should know there are people who do n ' t want to be said so .
W ome n l o ve talk ing .
My friend and I were going to do the home w or k after class es .
we were do ing the home w or k at the good p a ce .
But we talk ed about our high school days to re fresh our s el ve s because we were tired .
and we had not time to do the home w or k , so we went to each home .
It is very f un of me to talk with my friend s .
P ro b ably , most w ome n will like it .
I ' m a J a a p an e se .
I like c at .
She name is Ka r up in .
She w a k ed up me at se ve n every day .
But she sleep to g e ther .
It ' s very c ut e and I feel ri la x .
To day , m work ed as in ter n in a small ve n ture comp an y .
In this comp an y , there are only four people there and some in ter n students includ ing me .
This comp an y de al with some It like business .
And to day after the work ing I had a dinner with my a c qu a in t ance , a person who is work in in the f a m ous con s ul ting comp an y a c c en ture .
He is also b or n in Ka n s a i are a , I mean O s a k a , so the te m po we are talk ing ma t ch es .
The to p ic came to the ex pe ri ence I had in my P h i ll i p in e tri p that I had in this A u g ust .
This tri p was he l d by all myself to see the thoroughly different c ul ture and study English , and my tri al re s ul ted in success .
I could ex pe ri ence d p re c i ous time .
And as I talk ed about that to p ic , I do n ' t know why , but I not ic ed tea r s in my eyes .
This is probab ly because of that ex pe ri ence , I had there , that is what I saw in s la m are a and people in po ver ty and what I felt un re as on able .
I thought I want to heart i ly change d this sit u ation , people who natural ly did n ' t do anything wrong .
I thought again , and what should I do ?
I asked to myself again in my mind , but my answer still could n ' t come back .
F ro m the a ng le where I was sea ted , I could see Y o s s y and behind her the g l o o m y , st or m y we a ther in Tokyo through the w in d ow , but could n ' t he ar any sound s of the ra in or thunder .
If you had stood next to the s l id ing do or of the room he ar ing what was being talk ed inside , you might have heard in ter m it te t laugh ing sound s made by a f e m al e , and mo no t on ous , ent h us i a st ic talk s by a ma le , which might have ga ve you an impress ion ; the at m o s p he re was not too bad , or too good either .
It has been about 2 week s I had j o in ed this sit e .
S ur e ly , I got many friend s that re ally want ed to help me .
However , I only found a friend on this sit e which was re ally kind and conc er n .
She was L a ur a also called as A m a y a , .
She was from U S .
She always help ed me on every j o ur n al s that I have written .
She also c or re c ted me .
I ' m pro ud of her because even though she was bu s y work ing and study ing .
She still got time to help me .
So , I would like to than k to A m a y a for her help s and a d v ic es .
I ho pe she will a ch i e ve her dr e a m to study in J a p an .
On b ir th day , f a m il ies ga ther and wish each other well .
I feel like please d .
I ho pe we will con t in u e to a pe a ce ful family in the future .
I have p r a c t ical train ing for three days , the comp an y ' s do r m have w i re less we b .
I c a n ' t s ur f the in ter ne t at the first day , so I am very s ad , because I s ur f the in ter ne t most ly every day .
But to day , I can s ur f the in ter ne t , I am very glad , so I like the comp an y more than before !
R e c ent ly , high - sp e ed train a c c id ent o c c ur r ed in C h in a .
J ust very c al m and gentle people who even talk to people in C h in a with this sit e .
O f course , not every on e does it all .
So , I want to see the world is still .
hi , I ' m C ar on te 7 5 1 and this is my first po st in this sit e ,
I ' d like to im p ro ve my e ng l ish writing some st or ies or paragraph s
I ho pe I will do the same with you
A t that time I did n ' t know how to eat them , so I po ur ed mi l k over them , which did n ' t ta s te very well .
In Tokyo I found out m u es l i in a gr o ce ry .
I saw that we should make them so f t by so a k ing them for s ever al hour s in y o g ur t .
It seemed a good idea .
I b ough t a p a c a ke of m u es l i , mi x ed them with y o g ur t and put it in my re f ri g er at or at night before going to be d .
In the next morning I had it with f r u it s j a m .
It was so de l ic i ous that it was ne ce s s ar y for my b re a k f a st .
I will be f un .
I T h in k My s el f on the Q u ic k S and
We ' ve had no long er life time e m p l o y ment s y s te m s ic e l ate 8 0 ' s .
In s te ad , I ' ve watch ed p ow er ful ha r as s ment like `` you ' re in c o m p in t ent ! `` or `` we do n ' t a f f or d to pay d ud e like you . `` in or d er to en f or ce them e ar ly ri t i re ment .
A fter in t ro d u c ing the perform ance s y s te m to mi m ic the U S , tea m w or k does not work and we think co - work er s as e ne m ies .
We us ed to be ha p p y and en er g etic even if we had hard time in a
We , however , ex p l o it te m p or ar y s ta f f and live in do g - eat - do g world .
We bu l ly we a k er s and we a k er s bu l ly we a ke st s .
L u c k ly I have a job and de p en ad able pay ment .
But , I some time s feel
help less when my co ll e a gue left the office .
I ' ve just re m e m b er ed I knew `` x x x `` has `` that `` mean ing when every on e told me , and I do n ' t want you guy s to mi s le ad my name any more !
My c ut e `` My L it t le P on y `` should not con ne t to such a n as ty w or d .
l o l o l o l No , they sh o ud not . . . . . . . . .
We just know `` K is s K is s K is s `` , so you can see c ut e and class y J a p an e se girl s have us er n ame s includ e `` x x x `` on t w it ter !
B el i e ve or not , we just think `` x x x `` look s `` Ka w a i i `` .
The reason my new name became `` C h l o e `` is my re al name start s `` C `` also .
: - ) I think `` C in d y `` is good one , too .
My de e pe st con d o l ence to the e ar th qu a ke v ic t im s .
I ' m pretty s ad about the e ar th qu a ke happen ed in J a p an the se days .
G o o d l u c k to all the people live in J a p an !
My comp an y ' s office hour is suppose d to be from 1 0 : 0 0 to 7 : 0 0 p m .
But , no body leave office at 7 : 0 0 .
My co w or k er all work unti ll l ate night .
I do n ' t know ex a c t ly what time they go back to home because I ' m first three people to leave office .
I usual ly leave office around 7 : 3 0 .
I want to finish job ex a c t ly 7 : 0 0 and enjoy my p ri v ate life .
But It ' s a w k w ar d to leave office to 7 while other are work ing s il ent ly . . .
I ' m not con f id ent about get ting a high s c or e very much , but I ' ll try my be st .
One of my friend s on s k y pe told me that all you have to do is con ce t r ate on the ex a m and re la x .
C er tain ly , To re la x is ne ce s s ar y to get a high s c or e .
S in ce I ' ve written some j o ur n al s about T O E I C , you might have gue s s ed that I ri s k my life for it , but it ' s not tru e .
Well , study ing bu s s ies s English is b l o o d y b or ing .
I do n ' t think very much that bu s s i ness English must be need ed to co m m un ic ate with for e i g n people .
what should I write to my p en p al s ?
if everything would be so easy then I just start writing right now . . .
it ' s big `` di le m m a `` .
can you re c o m m en d me something ?
T w o week s a g o I b ough t a new p or t able D V D play er that is re g ion free at an on line - sh op .
A l th ough I like it , I re al i z ed that some D V D s do not work .
I have l ot s of A m er ic an D V D s who se re g ion c or d is 1 in my house .
A fter I looked for why I can not watch some of them , I dis c o ver ed there are some D V D s that is difficult to re c o g n i z e the re g ion c or d with a re g ion free D V D play er .
That is why some my D V D s can not work with my D V D play er .
So , I am think ing when I go to A m er ic a next time , I am p l an n ing to bu y a p or t able re g ion c or d 1 ' s D V D play er .
I think if I b ough t it , since all my D V D s are re g ion c or d 1 , I could watch all of them .
A l th ough I have to stand this sit u ation before I will go to A m er ic a , I think it is a good idea .
I ho pe I will be able to bu y a good one with a good p ri ce .
I ' ve got a str a in ed back when I took a D V D of 2 4 .
It ' s too he a v y to me ?
It is last question l o l
When I speak E ng l s h , though It is n ' t per f e c t sen t ence , a n at ive speak er can understand what I mean .
But I always wonder my English is right . .
I have never visit for e i g n country .
As an English le ar n er , de f in ite ly , It is ne ce s s ar y to go to a b ro ad , But I did not have enough money .
I heard about S ook m y un g un ive r s ity T E S O L course is l in k ed for e i g n un ive r s ity , so after finish the course I ho pe to study going in for e i g n un ive r s ity .
As an English le ar n er , I felt the English education in K or e a was not effect ive .
T h r ough the T E S O L course , I ho pe to im p ro ve myself as the good English teacher .
A fter finish the course I will p r a c t ic e what I le ar n ed in K in d er g ar ten and if the ch ance come s to me I want to go to gradua te school .
However , the in ter f a ce is not so p h is t ic at ed as that of i P h on e .
M or e o ver , the display sp e ed is very s l ow so that I feel str es s a little .
A m a z on should de s i g n K in d le to show the pro g re s s st at us clear ly when it take s s ever al second s to finish some op er ation .
R e c ent ly I have a g l ut t on ous a p pe t ite . . . .
And the day before at e a dinner but I at e two hu m b ur g er l ate at night . .
B e hung ry soon a h ter eat ing . . .
why ? ? ?
M or n ing !
I found ed to M r ho u 8 5 9 2 9 8 4 ' s b ro g .
H is ch in e se f a ir y t al es are such a f ant a st ic !
How do you think about ly ing ?
Some people say that it ' s not good to tell a lie even it has a reason to do it , other s say that some time s we need to lie to make people feel better .
How do you think about it ?
In or d er to con t in ut e to write English , I should de c id e a them a .
The m a : D e p re s s ion J o ur n al
R e as on s : No w my hu s b and is work ing for school s as a J a p an e se teacher .
B y writing his de p re s s i o j o ur n al , I would like de p re s s ive p at i ent s and their family to know about this dis e a se and sure ly believe his or her re c o ver y .
( This is po s s i b ly d u e to my little read ing ex pe ri ence , my being la z y and i g n or ant . ) I certain ly enjoy ed read ing it in the original a co up le of year s a g o , and for that now I probab ly need the di ction ar y no more .
No w I stay in my a un t house .
E ver y time I ' m going to be on a tri p , I visit here .
There are five people here , un c le and a un t , un c le ' s mother , c ous in who is a man , c ous in who is a s ing le mother and has a b a b y .
I did not dr in k al ch o h o l a co up le days .
I was a very good girl .
I did n ' t dr in k yesterday too .
I have teaching a dance class every th ur s day . ( yesterday was th ur s day )
I was so r us h ing to go to a dance st ud i o .
I was l ate to leave my place .
I run to a st ation , and I found it out when I took train .
I w or e two different sh o es on my f o ot . . .
T h o se sh o es are different co l or s , different sha pe s .
I re ally want ed to go back to change them , but I did ' t have time to do it .
so I took train we ar ing two different sh o es .
I was stand ing by one f o ot on the train .
when I got the st ud i o , every body laugh ed at me so hard .
I was d y ing to laugh .
This co up le week , I ' ve been very bu s y .
I have a l ot of things to do , so may b e I was tired ? !
I know It ' s not good ex c us e .
I play ed f ut s al for the first time in three week s and s c or ed four go al s and did four as s is t s .
B t w , I ' m going to bu y a present for g if t ex change part y on C h ri st m as but do n ' t know what to bu y because the present is n ' t for some on e sp e c i al .
I could n ' t us ing a comp ut er for a long time .
So , I could n ' t sen d my return me s s age .
I am sorry for the de la y in my respon se .
And I ' m just feel ing a little de p re s s ed about J a p an .
The sit e is re ally good because many people who le ar n second or th ir d language in there and all of us help each other ; c or re c t our each writing .
U n t il re c ent I had give n up writing con t in u ous ly s ever al time s , however the sit e is like a so c i al co m m un ity and I can visit there as possible I can .
So I could keep writing more f re qu ent ly .
As my friend in the sit e say , I need to read more English writing .
The ar t ic le was about a girl who had N e w Z e al and father and J a p an e se mother .
She ha te her look ing unti l she was te en age r .
But la ter she found about her be a ut y her s el f and became a fashion mo d el .
I was impress ed about her story .
A fter that I am think ing ma g a z in es are good for read ing , but I can not a f f or d to bu y new ma g a z in es and I do not want to read old ma g a z in es from second h and sh op s .
However I might have to bu y new ma g a z in e some time s .
R e c ent ly , I have got a B l ow O f f V al ve for c ar .
She live s in Tokyo to go to a un i she se le c ted , so we have n ' t see n each other for a while .
We talk ed a l ot of things and c r a c k ed up : - >
I like c ook ing more than anything else , but I ' m wonder ing de e p ly if I should go into the way of c ook ing . . .
In addition , I re ally like c ook ing , but am not good at c ook ing very much .
And if you live in F r ance , please give me some i nformation about F r ance . ( In English , please . )
If we had a large ga r d en , we could b ar b e c u e there .
If you were a b s ent in the class , you would be y el led at by the teacher .
If you had left a me s s age on my p h on e , I would have called you back .
A : Why did you ri d e a b i ke to her home yesterday ?
It was too far from your house , was n ' t it ?
B : If I had had a c ar , I would have go ne there by a c ar .
To day I so l d my g u it ar to day because I ' m going back to J a p an soon and I c a n ' t a f f or d to take my g u it ar to J a p an .
I b ough t my g u it ar 1 0 month s a g o and have play ed every day before going to be d .
I told my s is ter to play my g u it ar s in J a p an con st ant ly because my in st r u ment s feel l on e ly .
There is a fact that your in st r u ment s will go bad if you do n ' t play them for a long time .
I c a n ' t believe that N ation al C ent r al L i b r ar y change d my in ter n time , and they did n ' t tell me !
So un f or t un ate ly , I have to c ance l my part - time job d ur ing my s um m er va c ation , and also make me los e at least 8 0 0 0 N T do ll ar s .
but I do n ' t know how to make it .
how do every on e get many friend s ?
if I sen d me s s age to strange r like `` he ll o M a y I be one of your friend ? ``
I re ally think we will be good language part n er : ) `` ?
I have n ' t ever a p p ro a ch to people so much .
I s this re ally j a p an e se think ing ?
L ook ing la ng - 8 , there are va ri ous people .
But I not ic e J a p an e se difficult .
I am J a p an e se but J a p an e se language has many con f us ing .

When have you tra ve led some where re c ent ly ?
I have been to T ur ke y last s um m er .
I went to C a p p ad o c i a .
C a p p ad o c i a is very interest ing because there are many character is t ic r ock s .
One of them is like a came l ( P ic ture 1 is it ) .
I s c al ed r ock s and scene ry which I saw from the up p er part of r ock s is so beautiful and am a z ing .
I was impress ed with the be a ut y of nature .
I found a di f f er ence of s um m er between G er man y and J a p an .
In J a p an , we listen the bu z z ing of c ic ad as every time and every where .
I l o ve s um m er better than w in ter , because I like s w im m ing , water m el on , and f i re w or k e t c .
I have to try to s a ve on e le c t ri c ity this year , so I ' m going to bu y a J a p an e se f an .
Why I ' m study ing English is to co m m un ic ate with people from other co un t ri es and to study j e w el le ry de s i g n in A m s ter d a m ( the N e ther l and s ) .
I b a k ed a c a ke unless us ing eggs and but ter last week .
I re ally re ally like them .
But almost sweet s are very high c al or i e .
So I thought out how to b a ke a c a ke without much o il , eggs and the other high c al or ies stuff .
O f c o ur se it should be y um m y !
It was light ta s te and y um m y .
My mother told me she l o v ed it too .
This re c i pe have became my re g ul ar me n u !
It was sp ic y but ta s ty .
The p ri ce was more ex p en s ive than other re st a ur ant , but s er v ic e was better .
There was the m us ic b and play ed n ic e m us ic .
I ' d like to go to again .
2 n d - an n ive r s ar y of going out with my girl f ri en d .
To day is 2 n d - an n ive r s ar y of going out with my girl f ri en d .
F ir st , we went to A m er ic an V i ll age .
She b ough t me a bo t t o m and two shirt s .
It ' s so co o l !
S e c on d , we went to Ka i y u k an ( This is a qu ar i um in O s a k a ) .
We looked at many fish es and took many p h ot o s .
I will bu y present for her ( because we did n ' t have time to day ) .
I ' ve got to know here just a f e w days a g o .
I do n ' t know who made this we b s ite , but I w an n a a p p re c i ate him / her .
It ' s very interest ing place to get part ic i p at ed in ! : )
I l o ve ri d ing b ic y c le !
We can enjoy M i ku to s ing so ng s as we like .
They made her s ing in front of hu n d r ed s people ! !
M i ku took her first conc er t in Tokyo and A m er ic a .
I felt de e p impress ion when I saw her conc er t D V D .
I s an g to g e ther her and an a ud i ence in D V D ( ^ ^ ;
No w J a p an e c on o m y is de c re as ing .
The a ut o m o b i le has been an ma in e ng in e for J a p an e se e c on o m y for a long time .
In 1 96 0 ' s and 7 0 ' s any you ng people long ed a c ar .
I ' m sure M i ku ' s conc er t is first thing ! ( ^ ^ ) I ' m very very glad to see G ame C h ar a c ter coming to see me out of P C .
I went to Y u as a town yesterday for business tri p .
That town is well know as old so y s ous e town .
So y s ous e was made about 8 0 0 year s a g o in that town , so there are a l ot of old so y s ous e and so y be an s fact or y there .
We also visit ed so y so u ce m us i um .
He y , I did n ' t write anything on la ng - 8 for a long , long time .
G u es s it was because f i re in me did b ur n to the co al and I ' ve los t my spirit : (
So , in the past two year s I ' ve change d a l ot , now I ' m certain ly more to l er ant , f o c us ing on my study ing , but not for g e t ting about friend s : D
And , I ' m k or e an who live in k or e a .
I re ally re ally want to study e ng l ish with another country friend s .
The life is full of te m p t ation s , es pe c i ally in which some on e study a b ro ad .
My friend and I went to eat supper to g e ther for ce le b r ate his future .
A fter we went to In ter ne t to play game .
N e x t , we play ing c ar d , because the ti ne so long that we were hung ry .
I and two me n went to bu y some f o o d at 3 o ' clock in night .
U n f or t un ate ly no ne of one open , we watch ed a G u i P i an called ' The gr ud g e ' and sleep ing .
under too m u ch p re s s ur e
O f the most hot to p ic in my class , the p re s s ur e we under is talk ed f re qu ent ly .
It is said that students in for e i g n usual ly get up at 9 : 0 0 and then go to school , and it is 3 : 0 0 when the school is over , right ? ? ? But the sit u ation in our country is the op po s ite .
No t only the time t able is am a z ing , but the con t ent we le ar n is a l ot .
E ver y ter m we study C h in e se , M a th , English , P h y s ic s , C he m t ry , B i o l o g y , H is t or y , P o l it ic s , G e o g r a p h y , M us ic , A r t , and P h y s ical education , 1 3 in all .
That is s c ar ri ed , do you think so ? ?
On the other hand , the know led g e we study is also difficult , too .
No w I give a sub j e c t for in st ance , which is the most difficult sub j e c t in one of our ma th t est ( I us e picture to show it ) :
F ir st week have pass ed in C an ad a
But , I feel little di f f er ence between J a p an and C an ad a because there are many J a p an e se students who be l on g to my same co ll e g e at un ive r s ity , which I ' m stay ing .
It ' s mean ing less study ing a b ro ad , though I want to p r a c t ic e con ver s ation in English .
Then , I am not good at he ar ing and con ver s ation .
D o es en y on e tell me the way to pro g re s s with con ver s ation s k i ll ?
I am a st ud ent , study English for becom ing f l u ent ly English speak er .
My st ut ent v is a has been sen t to my house from A m er ic an e m b as s y this morning .
I ' m feel ing easy now get ting the v is a al th ough I knew there is no pro ble m . . .
It was first time to go to the A m er ic an e m b as s y .
When I got there , I was so surprise d that there are a l ot of people w a in ting outside the e m b as s y .
M or e than 1 5 0 pe a p le were there .
On ly 6 people per one time can get into the little house next to the ga te , and that ' s why we had to wait so long .
I had been stand ing for 1 hour s .
I was l u c k y that day was not ra in y or s un n y . .
it is mi d s um m er now but it was co o l in that day .
G e t ting inside the house , The man c he c k ed me and my b a g with the X - ra y ma th in e .
To my surprise , I had to left my ce ll ul ar p h on e .
and then , I f in ally could get inside the e m b as s y .
It take s more 3 0 minute s to have done all things inside .
I need ed to have an it er ve i w and have my f ing er p r in t s took , too .
A ll f un i ture s of the bu il d ing was A m er in c an style .
I feel like already being in U .
It was funny .
H a ve you ever been to J a p an e se E m b as s y in your country ?
How was it ?
I gue s s you do n ' t have to wait so long . . .
She usual ly say : `` I ' m so tired ! ! ``
now , my mother is read ing English , because she want
I ' m only M id d le school st ud ent .
I ' ll sen t it to you soon ! ! ^ ^
The le ad er of the de p ar t ment that I ' m tak ing told that most of so p h o m or es includ ing those who transfer ed to this co ll e g e might ' ve got ten over 6 5 0 point s at T O E I C .
And I had thought I was s m ar ter than students who had st ud i ed at the co ll e g e just because I transfer ed .
I found that wrong .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t like to comp ar e .
One of the reason s is be c as u e when you comp ar e your s el f with other s and if there is some on e s m ar ter than you , you get very de p re s s ed , like you ' re going to di e .
A no ther reason is that I do n ' t like people who look down on some on e es le , and when there is some on e less s m ar t than me , I find myself look ing down on him .
As I w ro te yesterday , I had to write a r ough dr a f t of short re p or t on be h al f of my el d er d aught er .
To day , I had to tra n s l ate her me s s age for the gradua tion ce re m on y .
She will be gradua ted from e le ment ar y school soon !
She had sp ent only 3 month s in this e le ment ar y school , She need ed to write some ar t ic le s ;
But I am all an x i e ty now .
You know , my English s k i ll is such poor and I do n ' t have any con f id ence to my writing at all .
If there were more time to sub m it , I would write the sen t ence s here and as k to c or re c t !
The T y p h o on I s A p p ro a ch ing !
A ty p h o on is s l ow ly on it s way to J a p an .
I ' m p l an n ing to tra ve l to G un m a p re f e c ture on S ept e m b er 2 n d and 3 r d .
So I ' m w or ri ed about it .
I ' ll go to the hot sp a and eat many de l ic i ous f o o d such as c r a b s , s te a k s , de s s er t s and so on at the hotel .
I st ud i ed English and about my ma j or much in this s um m er va c ation , so I want to take a re st and enjoy this tri p !
I want to go to as many place s as possible !
How I should do ?
I think , F ir st I re m e m b er a l ot s of English w or d s .
N e x t I re m e m b er a l ot s of ng l ish sen t ence .
she is one of my favor ite J a p an e se s ing er .
I re ally like her so ng s es pe c i ally a so ng follow ing U R L .
She has stop p ed her act i v ity for her sick and now take a long b re a k .
I re ally want her to be back and re la se new so ng s some day .
He r so ng give me en er g y es pe c i ally when I feel kind of down .
I think every on e have own f a v i ri o te so ng that make you feel better .
I like both J a p an e se so ng called J - p op and for i e ng m us ic .
But J a p an e se m us i i is more con f or t able for me , may b e because it ' s easy to understand the mean ing of ly ri c s .
S pe a k ing of ly ri c s in e ng l ish so ng , it ' s very hard to l is i ten and understand comp ar ed to con ver s tion . . .
D o es any on e feel the same way when you he ar so ng written in your l ar n ing language ?
In the future ho pe ful ly my e ng l ish become good and understand ry l ic s .
I have been st ud ing English for e i g h te en year s , start ing from the school , con t in u ing at the in st it ut e and now - by myself .
But I have no great success es in my st ud ing .
F or ex amp le , I can understand very small part of ra d i o and t v b ro d c as ting , di al o g s in mo ve picture s .
C o ul d some on e give me a hand ? T ow sen t ence s , A : `` D o you like the gr e en one ? `` and B : `` What about the b l u e one ? `` .
C an I tra n s f or m A and B ' s position in the follow ing ar t ic le ?
What ' s the di f f er ence from `` do you like `` and `` what about `` ?
It s beautiful , but too small for me .
It s a n ic e dress , I ' ll take it .
it s been a w h i le since I w ro te the last one here .
how s life going every on e ?

S t i ll I want to con t in u e .
I ' m keep ing this j o ur n al for my d aught er to be interest ed in for e i g n language s in the future .
M o ther ' s j o ur n al written in for e i g n language s is interest ing enough to mo t i v ate her d aught er to le ar n to read them .
D o n ' t your think so ?
My bo y f ri en d and I have f al ling in l o ve each other , M ar ch , last year .
So , we went to the very p op ul ar re st a ur ant in L ot te hotel .

It is J u ly 2 n d to day - - that mean s a half part of this year has pass ed .
This half year was quite bu s y one for me .
A fter mo v ing into C A and get ting us ed to the life , I found myself have got p re g n ant .

I ho pe it would be a good one and I ' d like to me e t my b a b y b or n just he al th y .

A t N e w Y e ar ' s D a y , we had N e w Y e ar s dis he s `` O se ch i `` .
But now most J a p an e se bu y it at the s up er m a ke t and de p ar t ment st or e .
B e c a us e there once live d so many people s in a family , and mother and gr and m a ther made much dis he s for their ch il d re n and gue st s , however , there are many n u c le ar f a m il ies in J a p an and are f e w gue st s .
`` O se ch i `` ma k ing is re ally hard work .
I mi s s the c ust o m s are going to los e .
And this time is my first p ic n ic in my co ll e g e !

M ed ical C he c k up for B re a st C ance r

A L it t le He st it ation and N er v ous
I am so bu s y the se days .
My gr o up ' s le ad er asked me p re p ar e ra ce speech and a show of a c c o m p l ish ment s be c as u e have a va c ant position for a se c re ta ry of you th le a gue co m m it te e in the gr o up .
I just have a little he s it ation and n er v ous .
M a y be I should to take things co o l ly .
This picture is of b a b y to m at o in my k it ch en ga r d en .
I gr e w some p l ant s of to m at o , e g g p l ant and gr e en pe p p er in A p ri l .
It was un c er tain ly we a ther in this sp r ing , and I w or ri ed whether their p l ant s gr ow up well .
F or t un ate ly , some p l ant s of to m at o have many f r u it s .
To day is very good day ! ! !
I go to ar t school less on tri al in morning .
In or d er to tak ing an ex a m in ation in C o ll e g e of A r t s .
I must become s k i ll ful draw ing r ough s ke t ch so ex a m in ation ! !
N e x t I go to K A R A O K E with a friend in after no on .
I s ing a l ot of so ng s ! !
It ' s ex it ing ! !
The man g a is l o ve story of 1 6 P .
I just started to make it yesterday .
What ' s a bad day !
N e ed less to say and no se le ction for me , I had to we ar a l ot of c l o th es and make my effort to keep my body w ar m before I went to school .
Yes , I had act a s n ow man to day . . .
A c t u ally , I did n ' t know and understand that why my school could n ' t provide the w ar m water to all of the students after they had finish their p h y s i o l o g ic ally need .
I m a g in e that you have just finish ed p is s ing , when you are going to was h and c le an your hand s , you have to let the C O L D water run through your hand s .
What ' s the ' great ' feel ing that is !
The w in d blow ed my W E T hand s and I could feel my hand s were sha k ing .
What ever , I know that I have to cha ll e ng e the nature again tomorrow , even if I do n ' t want to face it .
E ver y time I me t a for e i g n er interest ed on le ar n ing sp an ish and also interest ed on l er n ing the language on a sp an ish speak ing v o un t ry their natural ch o ic e was S p a in .
and I started wonder ing why .
It might be that sp a in is close r to them because in E ur o pe all co un t ri es are kind of to g e ther , or the c ur re n c y .
but then again , so u th am er ic a is far , I know , but by p la ne is what 1 3 1 5 hour s away from e ur o pe ?
P la in ti c ke t , much more ex p en s ive . . .
then what .
many things we a p p re c i ate being our s are act u ally the her it age of S p an ish , G er man , or ho ll and e m i g r ant s .
but this mi x of c ul ture s to g e ther with the effect of time over our p op ul ation make us a country ri ch on ar t and ar ch ite c ture .
P le a se if you are p l an n ing to visit a sp an ish speak ing country , don t l o o se the ch ance of dr op ing here or in an y other ne i g h b or country .

I have a difficult y
I am study ing of English w or d s for get ting high s c or e on T O E F L t est .
But I am having a trouble .
It is that I found it difficult for me to understand the s c i ent if ic w or d s .
B e c a us e their mean ing are difficult if I tra n s l ate their w or d s from English into J a p an e se .
F or ex amp le , `` C or i o l is effect `` , `` sp e c t r um `` and e t c .
I do n ' t re m e m b er the se w or d s quite .
But I will , want to gradua te from A m er ic an un ive r s ity , so I will study hard ! ! !
My friend and I visit ed M or in a g a comp an y , and j o in ed in fact or y - to ur .
It made me ha p p y so I ' m a ch o c o h o l ic .
A t end of the to ur , a g u id e ga ve us `` H i - c he w `` , can d y .

B el ow picture is it s s n a p s h ot .
P re p ar ing Z on b i W al k part 2 .
I went to C h i b i C an ad a to p re p ar e z on b i W al k .

I think I ' m good at mi m ic ing z on b i .
B y the way .
I do n ' t ri d of j e t la g .
D o you know how to ri d of it .
P le a se tell you . . . . ! ! !
I ' ve been think ing about writing b l o g in English , but I was n ' t sure how I could start it .
To day when I was ne t - s ur f ing for b l o g s in English , I happen ed to find this sit e .
I ma j or ed in so c i o l o g y at So p h i a un ive r s ity in j a p an since I ' m interest ed in what affect s people ' s de c is ion s whether to do something or not .
U n f or t un ate ly , I have n ' t a ch i e v ed that yet , but now I ' ve ch o s en English education for my care er and I ' m enjoy ing my work teaching students .
It was not only out of c ur i o s ity but also because I did n ' t feel that I f it ted in my s ur r ound ing s well .
I thought that if j a p an was not the be st place to live in , just try another one .
You can ch o o se where you live , you have ch o ic es - that make s you feel easy when you find your s el f un f it ted in your circumstance .
If you can speak e ng l ish , you can live almost every where .
I ' m also interest ed in an a ly z ing the ty pe s of so c i e t ies .
I want to think about what ty pe of a so c i e ty j a p an is through my every day ex pe ri ence s , and express my view s on the J a p an e se so c i e ty .
I wish to get fee d b a c k from people who visit my b l o g from over se as and ex change opinion s about j a p an and your country .
When I c ut my f ing er , a l ot of b l o o d ra n out .
A t that time , I was was h ing the dis he s , and the s in k became to ta ly re d .
I was surprise d , and r ash ed into the bath room to was h my hand .
I a p p l i ed a B and - A id , see ing the s in k look ing as if a scene of m ur d er .
( E : ex a m in er , M : me )
M : Yes I do .
I live with my w if e , two so n s and my mother .
M : We get to g e ther only once a year at my home .
M : There are a l ot of f a m ous sp ot s .
E : What are the interest ing place s to visit in your home t ow n ?
It re se m ble s the N e w Z e al and .
As if the big b l u e mo on speak s me . . .
I always ch o se st able way . . .
I always be afraid f a il ur e . . .
I always a v o id tru e my feel ing s . . .
And probab ly I dis t re s s myself about my at t it ud e .
The mo on light as k me to make life for your s el f .
I wonder how many time s should I see the mo on to make a s te p to w ar d . . .
This is to night . . .
I just s l ept 5 hour s yesterday because of ch ur ch things .
and went to the ch ur ch .
H m m I b or r ow ed 2 b ook s for s is ter who m I know .
re m e m b er the s is ter who m I told to you ?
the p re e t ies t s is ter who m
( da m n , I do n ' t know how I express . )
2 week s la ter , there will be ex a m a w a it ing me .
I de c id ed my mind
This was a J a p an e se p op ul ar an im e .
It is in the new s , in J a p an , that a man who name a ti g er ma s k make a con t ri b u tion for ch il d re n ' s in st it u tion .
To day I had the p l ent y of time in the after no on so I took walk a ro un g my home t ow n .
A t first I went return D V D s which I r ent a f e w days a g o .
And then I went to a b ook st or e which so l d the second - hand b ook s .
In fact when I was a high school st ud ent , I be l on g ed to A m er ic an F o ot b a ll c l u b .
I us ed to a re p re s ent at ive A m er ic an F o ot b a ll er of my p re f e ture . . . .
It ' s ir re ally tru e ! !
He has n ' t been change d at all .
When I was about to go home , it ' s going to be ra in . . . .
I sh o u k d a v o id to tak ing a bath . . .
It see m s to be hu m id we a ther to day .
S u ch a we a ther is no good for me , because I us e the b i ke to co m m ut e .
nothing I have done , but I am ha p p y
It will be gr ate if I make friend s with English am d J a p an e se speak er s .
F or ex amp le , let ' s say you can not get any idea to write in your ent ry on L an g - 8 .
You talk to your s el f , `` a h , I can write nothing on L an g - 8 to day . `` And the explain of that you can write nothing affect s you .
Some th ing to write might o c c ur to you if you kept on think ing for a while , but you become not to get any idea to write re ally d u e to your explain ing , `` I can not `` .
If you o b s er ve your s el f , you may find how you are affect ed by what you talk to your s el f in every day life .
being an e ng l ish teacher
One is D a v id from E ng l and and one is C h in e se .
O f course , D a v id is the teacher .
He ' s help ing that C h in e se woman with her English because her English is not that good .
She need s to im p ro ve it , she say s .
I le ar n English not because it ' s us ed every where but I like it .
I like language le ar n ing .
I think I will write more if I have time and am in the right mo o d l o l .
L a st day in F e b r u ar y
To day is the last day in F e b r u ar y this year .
What do you think ?
We had already two month s go ne .
D o some on e know good way s for me ?
I p l an n ed to go to G r and C an y on on the way to J a p an this J u ly .
But There are no a v a il able sea t s in the a ir p la ne s by which I can go to sight se e ing around L as V e g as .
So I just tra n s it at L as V e g as . . .
I will mo ve to a new place so I qu it English con ver s ation school at the end of this month .
My last class was this M on day though , I had to go to my d aught er ' s c r a m school at that time .
I like my English teacher , S e an , and I some time s w ro te about him here .
H is teaching style is so un i qu e that I l o v ed the way .
He always en c o ur age d me and spoke to me after class es .
We enjoy ed cha t ting in co up le minute s .
When I listen ed to that , I was very ha p p y .
I mi s s that I could n ' t at ten d the last class very much .
I want ed to express my than k s feel ing s , and I also want ed to say good by e .
If I know his e - ma il address , I can con ta c t with him though . . .
A fter I mar ri ed , I ' ve re pe at ed mo v ing because of my hu s b and ' s business .
This is se ve n time s .
P e op le told me that I ' m l u c k y because I can live many place s , and I can have the ex pe ri ence which people c a n ' t .
O f course , it is tru e but I ' m not an easy going person like that my friend s think .
M o v ing some time s works mi n us .
S e an and I could ma in tain good re l ation s h i p s if I did n ' t mo ve .
I always have to c ut good re l ation s h i p s by myself even if I do n ' t want to do that .
In this case , I c ut two good re l ation s h i p s by myself .
One is my o il pai n ting teacher , and the other is my English teacher .
I ' ve never return ed back to here so I never me e t them from now on .
I know that after pai n ful se p ar ation , I will have good meeting .
There f or e , I will be op t im is t ic , and I want to expect good meeting in a new place .
F e w last days have been strange .
S in ce I ' ve came back home , I ' m feel ing very l on e ly .
My mother and brother are in I ta ly , my father ' s re c ent ly work ing almost who le day out of town and I can see him only for a while every day .
F ri en d s I ' d like to see are all out of town too .
A t first I thought it will be great to have so much time only for myself and my ho b b ies , but I gradua l ly found out it ' s not that easy .
S in ce I have so much time , I do things I ' d never expect myself to do at the begin n ing of s um m er ho l i day .
And I a b s o l ut e ly do n ' t know why am I do ing such a thing , because I ' ve never been interest ed in it .
To m or r ow I ' m having a J a p an e se less on after a long time .
I ' m very ha p p y about it , also because my teacher is a very good friend .
F ir st we saw the 8 picture s and gue s s ed what this story is about .
And then we read this ar t ic le .
What story do you im age from the se picture s ?
T w o month s has pass ed since I came here .
I am re ally le ar n ing a l ot , but I some time s wish the class es would be a b it more difficult so that I could le ar n more .
To day , I j a m m ed with a b ri t ish person in his house because his b and los t the g u it ar is t , so he was look ing for one .
I was surprise d how people here make friend s .
N e x t month , I have n in e days va c ation .
I f a il ed to get a W or k ing H o l i day V is a of U K . . .
It mean s that I can not work there and will have to go back J a p an only 6 month s because of a circumstance of my money , if I had got ten the a p po in t ment I could stay up to 2 year s . . . .
It ' s so tra g ed y for me .
I ' m feel ing so b l u e de s p ite in N e w Y e ar . . . .
I have a dr e a m I will be a teacher .
O r e m p l o y er of little sh op .
T h an k you for you visit ing and read ing my ma s s age !
I will try to write my di ar y in English for my le ar n ing .
But I c a n ' t write so difficult w or d s and sen t ence .
I ' m not good at English , so please c or re c t my mistake if you want .
I will be a un ive r s ity st ud ent and le ar n ing In ter n ation al s c i ence from S p r ing : )
T h an k s a l ot for all of your help s with my English st ud ies , my friend s : )
F a ll in l o ve
A c t u ally it is just in f at u ation ! ! !
But I believe my in t u i tion ! ! !
She is just new st ud ent at my school .
She is K or e an , while I ' m J p an e se . . .
How can I man age this sit u ation ?
1 to give up her .
2 to for ce her to go out with me
3 to study K or e an language
A ma in difficult y is a di f f er ence of our language s . . .
How can I tell my feel ing to her ! ! !
My im a g in ation is still get ting big g er ^ ^
In conc l us ion , s el f con t ro l and a d a p t ation make a success ful life .
When you walk on the ro ad to your success , there are many te m p t ation s which p re v ent you from do ing what you should do for your success ful life .
With o ut s el f con t ro l , you will get side t r a c k ed easily .
When you face to o b st a c le s , you should a p p ly an a p p ro p ri ate a d a p t ation in or d er to mo ve for w ar d .
I do n ' t have good e ar s , so I had to listen to C D again and again in or d er to copy p h r as es and write it into m us ic she e t s .
It took long time to finish one so ng .
No w , I do n ' t need m us ic she e t any more .
To enjoy my ho b b y more effect ive ly , work ing p re l im in ar i ly is require d .
I b ough t a voice re c or d er that is called a line ar P C M re c or d er .
This kind of re c or d er can re c or d your voice and m us ic at the same le ve l or high er as C D ' s .
My old er one ' s sound le ve l was M P 3 , so when I heard the re c or d ed voice s , I had to stand he ar ing c r a c k ing sound s .
B T W , I ch o se So n y , which has a good re p ut ation of it s beautiful sound s .
J a p an is going on he at w a ve over 3 5 de g re es every day .
We have to be care ful a he at in j ur y like the se days .
It ' s im p or t ant that we take water and s al t as of ten as possible not to be the he at in j ur y .
E s p c i ally old people have the he at in j ur y easily .
J a p an is ti g h ting a e le c t ri c p ow er because of a c c id ent of n u c le ar p ow er p l ant by e ar th qu a ke .
We have to try to s a ve on e le c t ri c ity .
N e w Y e ar ' s E V e
I have 4 days long N e w Y e ar ho l i day s .
G o o d ~ I must or g an i z e the s ch ed ul e for the se 4 days long ho l i day s well .
I am p l an n ing on going to T a i pe i 1 0 1 p la z a to enjoy a f i re w or k s show .
A l th ough it is a little b it c l ic he as every year I always go there to see f i re w or k s .
No idea what to write about , let ' s just see if I ' m able to pro d u ce con s is t ent English , at least on paper ( on mo n it or , you ' d rather say : ) ) .
A l th ough I do n ' t like the se co m m er c i al i z ed sit es that off er everything in the for m of s ever al easy s te p s , I have to a d m it that the va st and help ful co m m un ity easily over c o m p en s ate s it : )
As I not ic ed people like to b re a k things into paragraph s here , some time s having a de d ic at ed one for each sen t ence .
This is my first di ar y on L an g - 8 .
So I s l ept 1 2 h o ur s !
O ur bu s run through va st s te p pe and I enjoy ed p an or a m ic view s from there .
A ll an im al s I saw in M on g o l i a seemed con f or t able .
E a ch time when I me m or i z e the e ar th qu a ke , it always make s me pai n ful , because the ho r ri ble scene that I ex pe ri ence d and saw from T V and D V D s of ten appear s in my mind , and I can hard ly for g e t people ' s b l o o d y face and in c o m p le te body under the r u in s .
H um an being was so f r a g i le in the face of nature dis aster .
That e ar th qu a ke change d me a l ot , and it made me re th in k of myself , how I should live and what the most im p or t ant thing in my life is .
I think it ' s ne ce s s ar y for me to write down what happen ed and what I ex pe ri ence d in the may , 2 0 0 8 , because it will re le a se something in my de e p heart and I re ally need a re le a se , and which have de p re s s ed me so long , and I must un l o ad them now .
A co up le of days a g o , I dis c us s ed f o o d s with my F il i p in o on line t ut or .
While we were dis c us s ing , our to p ic was cha ng ing to f a st f o o d .
So , when I spoke to him about M a c D on al d f o o d , he sh ar ed me with a very s c ar y v id e o c l i p from You T u b e .
However , natural f re n ch f ri es and a ha m b ur g er went ro t ten quick ly , but on the other hand , M a c D on al d ' s f o o d ' s ro t ten sp e ed was very s l ow .
The most s c ar ies t stuff is M a c D on al d ' s f re n ch f ri es .
I think that the guy is from my favor ite do c u ment ar y , `` S up er S i z e M e `` .
I re ally think that there are l ot of c he m ical stuff in M a c D on al d f o o d .
However , I re ally think that it is not only M a c D on al d f o o d , but also we can say quite the same things to another f a st f o o d .
However , I de f in ite ly need to think of where and what I eat .
This was after a de c ad e since we f in ally me t or talk ed on the p h on e .
He said , `` How are you do ing ?
We ' re very very long time no see . ``
I said , `` O h , I ' m fine .
But he said , `` I mo v ed to O s a k a from K y ot o and I still work as a m un ic i p al e m p l o y e e .
No th ing have I pro ble m .
I just re m e m b er you .
So I called you . ``
I felt s light strange , because he is mar ri ed and he also has a ch il d .
And He has not con ta c ted me for a long time .
If I were him , I probab ly had not con ta c ted for m er girl friend
just re m en b er ed .
The line was some h ow st ut ic k y .
So I said to him `` Where are you now ?
He re p l i ed me `` M e ?
A t the b al c on y of my a p ar t ment .
It ' s w in d y day to day . ``
D id n ' t he think about his w if e and ch il d ' s feel ing s ?
I con ta c ted a co m m on friend of us but he said my for m er bo y friend was O K .
I think , some time s he act ed ch il d ish be ha v or .
I be l ive he was into all along .
I ' ll re c o ver from lack of my sleep and p re p ar e for tax return .
What is the dr e a m of all of you ?
To day , I should present a g en er al as se m b ly of you th Y M C A .
F r an k ly speak ing , it is not so str ic t as we think , because the as se m b ly is he l d by you ng students from 1 5 to 1 9 .
I ' m 2 0 year s old , but I took a ro le that tea ch them what they should do in you th Y M C A .
I ' ve been a me m b er of you th Y M C A since I was 1 4 year s old ( in K or e a ) .
But As I gradua te from the high s ch o o l and go to a un ive r s ity , I ' ll begin to be in act i v ity in different place , and with different people and different way .
So this as se m b ly may b e the last act i v ity I do in this town .
B e ing a st ud ent I ' d been st u c k in you th Y M C A , the fact that I should leave there make s me mi s s it .
However , I ' ll do be st in this as se m b ly , and de l ive r what I ' d felt while I had been a me m b er of Y M C A as I can .
I am also in great ho pe that I can ex pe ri ence a new things .
To M a ke English sen t ence s
I started the p r a c t ic e to make English sen t ence s .
The p r a c t ic e is to tra n s l ate the simple J a p an e se sen t ence to English .
E la b or ate p r at ical p l an s can give you a hand when you face difficult s or feel de p re s s ed and help you get ri d of un e x pe c ted
It ' s re ally a bo l d and cha ll e ng ing p l an so that most people around him did n ' t s up p or t this p l an .
I went to co m m un ity c ent er this after no on .
I have been s ing ing a so ng once a month with ch or us me m b er .
A ll me m b er are good people and half of them are re t i re ment age .
I have enjoy ed every time .
O ur re p er t or y of so ng s are a f e w and our t al ent for s ing ing is not so good .
But it is a good way to keep me m b er ' s re l ation s h i p .
It is only once a month and so it is de if f ic ul t to im p ro ve each other .
Even enjoy able time is im p or t ant .
But 2 4 is the dr a m a which is in a little b it un us u al sit u ation and very difficult for me to listen to it .
J a c k bo u er always say s `` What ' s going on ! ! ! `` : ) .
A l th ough , A l ly M c B e al is very usual sit u ation and I l o ve it , but I am ma le . . .
I would like to listen to more E n l ish with e - dr a m as and le ar n da i ly con ver s ation more and de b ate .
T w o days after ( 6 / 1 2 ) , my bo y friend will come to my house .
My family go to l i b r ar y every other week .
We can b or r ow up to 1 0 b ook s each other .
I finish ed read ing the b ook this week , but I have to b or r ow the b ook next time .

a b as s dr um part play ed s te p of my sh o es by floor in s te ad of b as s dr um .
a s n ar e dr um part play ed us ing p en c il and desk in s te ad of st ic k and s n ar e dr um .
I did n ' t play well , so I ' ve never been impress ed other s .
S pe c i ally , I would of ten play ed in t ro d u c t or y pass age of ' into the l en s . '
The b a se g u it ar part of that t un e s y n ch ro n i z ed r h y th m of b as s dr um .
A t the same time , the ke y b o ar d part of that t un e s y n ch ro n i z ed r h y th m of s n ar e dr um .
But , does n ' t make me ex c ite much . . .
To day we hold meeting once a month .
I am J a p an e se high school st ud ent .
I become co ll e g e st ud ent next year .
I want co l or my ha ir and have one ' s e ar s p i er c ed next year .
But I want co ur age to be it .
But I have enjoy ment too !
I am find ing the way to en l ar g e my le ar n ing pro ce s s .
F or me , P h y s ic s is con s is ted of comp le x conc ept and a l ot of i nformation .
To le ar n it well , I must me m or i z e it with re al i z ation .
But I c a n ' t a ch i e ve that , as I am not good at me m or y .
I k on w that I will los e my way if the sit u ation con t in u e .
B e f or e that , I should find the so l u tion first .
As we know , success will not come in a s ud d en .
I c a n ' t pay for the success without my effort .
B e c a us e there are mean ing ful that we have sp ar e effort to str i ke our go al s .
No w , I understand that it is interest ing , so I can le ar n it e as i er than the past .
In fact , the w or d I write is to en c o ur g e myself for le ar n ing .
I do n ' t want to give up my study .
I have go al s as every on e .
I very of ten us e t w it ter in a day .
U s u ally I t w e e t about my think ing and new s ar t ic le s .
F or ex amp le , I read new s and if I felt it was interest ing , I t w e e t it s ti t le and l in k .
R e c ent ly , I had become to read new s on my i P h on e usual ly .
T y p ing on the i P h on e was both er ing for me because my ty p ing sp e ed was very l ow .
So I did n ' t a d d my commen t s when I was read new s v i a my i P h on e .
However , my ty p ing sp e ed was im p ro v ed dr a m at ic ally because of train ing us ing an enjoy able a p p l ic ation .
A l th ough c at s is so c ut , but take care it is a big pro ble m .
And now , I re al re al re al need keep my room c le an , to le ar n how to take care a c at .
B y the way , he ' s name is M i is e y .
It ' s S t ar t to day !
I can speak English a little , but R e c ent ly , I have to read English b ook s more and more .
I ' m a sen i or st ud ent in So o ch ow U n ive r s ity , I ma j or in teaching C h in e se as a for e i g n language and in ter n ation al tra d e .
R es p on d ing to an ar t ic le ( ' B e a ut i ful T h ing s W or k B e t ter ' )
In respon se to the ar t ic le ' B e a ut i ful T h ing s W or k B e t ter ' , being a teacher myself I could not agree more .
The year s sp ent on de s p er ate sea r ch for better te ch n i qu es , the very p r a c t ic e of teaching with it s am a z ing up s and sleep less down s has de f in it ive ly pro v ed that le ar n ing as such is to take place so le ly in f a v o ur able s ur r ound ing s .
The point on which I could take is s u es with the a u th or lie s soon er in how to c re ate the right en v ir on ment for the language a c qu is i tion to happen , give n each person is str i k ing ly different .
The thing I feel strong ly about is that it see m s un f a ir to de f y tra d i tion al education on the gr ound s that it f a il s to me e t every st ud ent ' s need s .
N ever th e less , if we da re take a close r look at c re at i v ity ( and what is le ar n ing if not a f as c in at ing mi x ture of ex pe ri ment ing , for m ing , sha p ing , pro d u c ing and the like ? ) then we have to a d m it that , in the long run , success ful ness is not a be d of ro se s , al b e it high ly re w ar d ed in the end .
S h or t stay in S en e a g al
I will go S en e g al for two month s in this a ut um n .
Then I have to dis c us s with my ho st re se ar ch er .
My f light de ter m in ed as previous at ta ch ed f i le .
F or the hotel s , I want to as k one more thing .
O ur comp an y will give me money for hotel and a ir ti c ke t but does n ' t give any other salary .
the new fashion t re n d is coming to Tokyo now .
P le a se let me know `` what do you think is good or bad ? ``
To day , I got on train .
But all girl s was us ing them mo b i le .
And train c re w s did n ' t tell them to stop us ing your mo b i le .
st ud ent from A m er ic a
So I talk ed with her little .
I tri ed hard tomorrow !
I want to im p ro ve my talk ing ability .
What should we do ?
If you have t time , please give me little a d v ic e .
I know , I los t him at all .
Even we b ro ke off have two year s .
But now , I know I mi s s him , I don t want los t con ta c t with him by now .
To m or r ow is our ho l i day , we should very ha p p y with my family , but I can t feel ha p p y .
I want c ry .
and act u ally I had a good c ry ed in my office at after no on .
I went into a sh op and asked a lady c l er k for a direction , and she kind ly off er ed me a l if t to my de st in ation !
M o st of the name s of l and s are M a or i name s and I found them sound quite f a m il i ar , being a J a p an e se n at ive .
A bout half of the people I saw walk ing down the street s was As i an .
I just re c or d ed C D .
I just had dinner and sat at desk .
I can feel ch i ll in the morning e ar ly .
I like the f a ll in the we a ther .
It make me sen t im ant al and mo o d y .
So I just re c or d ed C D .
While I dr i v ing in c ar , I of ten us ed to listen m us ic .
H a ve you heard S ting of m us ic i an ?
He ' s like a f a ll .
or H is voice is good ma t ch in the f a ll .
( I ' m not sure this sen ten se )
T H e more and more I have good re l ation s h i p s with my friend s , it is much hard er to say good - by e to them .
R e c ent ly , my English teacher left J a p an , and another teacher is le aving J a p an soon .
I would have difficult y get ting over this great s ad ness .
How does every on e get over the gr i e f ?
I re al i z ed that if I am in l o ve with a certain man , there will be when I have to say good - by e to the man .
Even if we l o ve each other , or no matter how we at t r a c t each other . . .
I am con f us ed by ro m ance re l ation s h i p s re c ent ly .
How s ad sea s on it is ! ! !
I ha te r us s i an we a ther .
It ' s M ar ch , but we ' ve just had a very th ic k s n ow f a ll .
M a y b e it ' s been even a b l i z z ar d .
To night , I went to the c ur ry re s ut a ur ant with my friend .
There are some In d i an s only , but they can speak J a p an e se and we can co m m un ic ate with them .
K e e m a c ur ry and c he e se n an ta st es very good ! But the n an is th in and wide , so it get s co l d in a minute .
And if you dr in k water A fter eat ing the n an , it a b s or b s water , and become big g er and big g er in your st o m a ch .
D o you have a favor ite J a p an e se f o o d ? I re c o m m en d a J a p an e se f o o d ' T e m p r a ' : )
This k n if e has very good qu al ity , and is pretty hand y as well .
On his way to the st or e a ne i g h b or saw him with the k n if e and called the police im m ed i ate ly .
It is said a d e qu ate work o ut help you keep ing your he al th .
I think walk ing is the e as ies t work o ut for almost every on e from you ng to old people .
The p ed ome ter co un t your s te p s when you put on it a ut o m at ic ally .
It is f un , even f un n er than expect ed .
I re c o m m en d that .
M or e than ten th ous and s s te p s a day is a p p re c i ate da i ly t ar g e t to a ch i e ve .
To be po s it ive is much more im p or t ant thing than I ' ve thought .
The b ook also said that you must not say or even think `` I do n ' t - - - . `` That mean s that you must not f o c us on ne g at ive side of any stuff s .
F or ex amp le , when you are afraid about something , do n ' t think `` I do n ' t have to be afraid . `` but in s te ad you can think `` R e la x ! ' or `` E n j o y . `` A c t u ally I c a n ' t agree with this easily , but the point is the same thing R o b er t told me before .
If there is water half of a c up , how do you think ?
To be able to answer for m er one make s us different .
No w I got what he said some h ow .
I do n ' t have a class every F ri day , but I have works h op s in s te ad .
S in ce I watch it with English sub t it le , it ' s not so compli c at ed to understand the story .
I also have a K or e an friend , who like s J a p an e se come d y and m us ic , and he can speak J a p an e se well .
I want to im p ro ve my speak ing and listen ing s k i ll , so I have a question .
D o you think watch ing mo v ies or dr a m as is a good way to study l an gue age s ?
R e m o v ed a p l aster
She b ro ke a bo ne of her left ar m two month s a g o .
I re ally l o ve watch ing v id e o c l i p s which en c o ur age me and mo t i v ate me .
A ccord ing to the v id e o c l i p , al th ough she is 9 0 year s old , she is still fine and has been keep ing c re at ing hand made v i o l in s .
I found a wonder ful c r a f t s man s h i p inside her .
S in ce I ' m not good at listen ing to the A r k an s as a c c ent , I c a n ' t understand what she is saying per f e c t ly .
However , the re p or ter ' s English sound s very clear ly , and I can gue s s what she is talk ing from the re p or ter ' s story .
C an you have ma in tain ed your mo t i v ation like her ?
A fter I watch ed it , I asked myself .
However , I some time s l o o se interest ed in pai n ting and le ar n ing English .
I know that in both pai n ting and le ar n ing English , if I would l o ve to m aster them , all I have to do is keep going .
However , it is the most difficult , and most of the people dr op out in the mi d way .
In the v id e o c l i p she look s b ri g h ten ing .
I re ally would l o ve to be the for e m o st c r a f t s man like her !
You know s she is a great s ing er .
No w my favor it so ng of her s is `` If I were a bo y ``
But re al bo y s do n ' t think de e p ly about their girl ' s feel ing .
I part ly agree it .
B o y s should think more and girl s should effort to understand .
E ver y body dr an k , at e a l ot .
C ha ng ing the sub j e c t , I ' m ex ha ust ed to day , because I had a l ot of works , but everything went well .
It ' s ra in n i ing
M a y b e the a ut um n has become d .
It has ra in n ed for three days , and the te m p er a ture dr op s to 1 8 de g re es c ent i g r ad e , It ' s co o l now .
I need to dress two c l o th es , but I feel co m f or t able .
In the st or e , a ut um n fashion start to show off ( se ll ) , yet they ' re ex p en s ive , I c a n ' t a f f or d the p ur se , It will b re a ke the b an k .
In my opinion , It ' s a ri p - off .
I ' ll bu y the a ut um n fashion unti ll the p ri ce become c he a p er ( the st or e give a dis c o un t )
I am a fresh man in un ive r s ity .
I got to know this we b sit e s ever al days a g o , and I have got through some ent ies written by other s .
I will sp en d some time to c or re c t C h in e se le ar n er ' s ent ies .
B e c a us e I wish more and more people can a p p re c i ate my mother to n gue .
F or the past 5 month s I had been watch ing a M e x ic an te le no ve la called T er es a .
She was mean , she lie d to her friend s , and said her mother was de ad cause she was e m b ar r as ed of her hu m ble ro ot s .
P l us , she d um p ed the ri ch guy and s ed u c ed his be st friend , who m also happen ed to be her s is ter ' s in law bo y f ri en d .
So , in s um m ar y she was a tra m p .
A n y way s , this past S un day the no ve la end ed .
My family came to my house and we c ook ed c ar ne as ad a we were all to g e ther to watch T er es a ' s last cha ter , we were ho p ing her to end home less and l on e ly ( like in the original ver s ion ) , but to our s up ri se she did ' t .
It was so un f a ir , she kept the money and the guy .
So , what did she le ar n ?
What was me s s age , be a tra m p and you ' ll s u ce ed ?
So to end this ent ry I ' ll just c ite T er es a ' s mo m : M e da s mi ed o T er es a . . .
3 r d , S um m it G l o b al J a p an re p or ted they would start to se ll in st ant f il m and in st ant came r a of P or al o id in J a p an in 2 0 1 0 .
P o la ro id face d f in an c i al c ri s y s and it stop p ed s el ling in st ant f il m and in st ant came r a .
I took many picture s by their came r a and f il m .
I re g re t ted that P or al o id stop s el ling th i er p h ot o g r a p h y pro d u c t s and think if I were ri ch man , I would bu y P o la ro id comp an y and con t in u e to se ll their pro d u c t s .
F or t un ate ly there is another ri ch comp an y and it re v ive P o la ro id .
One of the most at t r a c t ive point of P o la ro id is that we can see p h ot o s just after we take them .
But now we are us ing di g it al came r a to do that and run n ing co st to see p h ot o s take n by di g it al came r a is free while p h ot o s of P o la ro id co st s us f il m fee .
Even so P o la ro id has un i qu e at t r a c t ive point such as ex c it ing feel ing when we see p h ot o s appear ing on the f il m .
Then I thought re f ri g er at or was re ally like a ma g ic , because there were many de l ic i ous f o o d s in it .
There was o c c ur r ed a e ar th qu a ke in J a p an .
There has be an a e ar th qu a ke in J a p an .
When A e ar th qu a ke was o c c ur r ed , I was very an x i ous about my w if e and d aught er .
But It was con ne c ted with her .
I f e ar ed for her and d aught er s a f e ty .
A fter I was all ow ed from the comp an y to leave , I leave d office at 5 o ' clock for the place of her a little e ar ly .
I went to the S in a g a w a S t ation from S h i b u y a .
I thought It had take n about 5 hour s time .
But we did n ' t me e t at there , because it was n ' t work co m m un ic ation ne t w or k s y s te m .
A fter It was pass ed a little time , We could talk each other by s m ar t p h on e .
( my w if e is J a p an e se , I ' m K or e an )
I only had to walk for the same place .
I re a ch ed home at A M 5 o ' clock .
So I walk ed for 1 0 hour s all of time .
I was ha p p y to my family s a f e ty .
But I am very an x i ous about the a c c id ent of n u c le ar p ow er p l ant .
It is f e ar of ra d i o a c t i v ity .
I was work ing morning to no on to day .
I had a b it job and was easy to get tired to day .
What I would like to be or what I have to do near future .
I ' m a po s it ive think ing man so I ' ll just do what to do .
To m or r ow can never f a il to come so we have to be po s it ive .
W h i ch country s l aught er ed more ? J a p an ? or G er man ?
The his t or i an C h al m er s J o h n s on has written that :
It may be point less to try to est a b l ish which W or l d W ar T w o A x is a g g re s s or , G er man y or J a p an , was the more b r ut al to the people s it v ic t im is ed .
It is s ur p ri s ing how we s ter n people are un a w ar e of J a p an e se at ro c it ies while they always comp ar e H it l er to de v il .
M or e o ver , it is J a p an e se that w or s h i p the w ar c ri m in al s in a temple sp e c if ic ally bu il t for them .
As if that was n ' t enough , they change d their history te x t b ook de le ting , re m o v ing many of their fault s d ur ing the world w ar 2 .
In s te ad of a d m it ting it , they ' re just if y ing it saying that all we did was le g it im ate a ccord ing to the in ter n ation al law .
I s it le g it im ate that a b d u c ting you ng l ad ies from co un t ri es like K or e a , ch in a and se x u ally a b us e them in the w ar place ?
D if f er ence between G er man s and J a p an e se is that it see m s like J a p an e se are not as ha m ed of what they did in the past while G er man s are not only as ha m ed of what they did but also did not for g e t to a po l o g y to v ic t im i z ed country such as P o l and .
A m a z ing ly , in J a p an , the p ri m e mi n is ter has re c ent ly change d every year .
A n y way , we have already had four p ri m e m in is ter s since K o i z um i .
J a p an e se people are now expect ing the new le ad er , and a new er a .
G o o d - look ing A m er ic an play
I have many days without on la ng - 8 .
B e c a us e my work and le ar n ing too bu s y .
C la s s m ate tell me good - look ing A m er ic an play .
It ' s name N I K I T A .
B y M a g g i e Q star r ing .
No w the first sea s on only se ve n set s .
I was impress ed that the f o c us and s y ut ter sp e ed of the came r a
I have an at ten tion to a v i o d the new came r a b r ow k en by my so n .
It is ra n y day to day .
I think it ' s very im p or t ant for me to have as many op p or t un it ies to talk to a n at ive speak er or a person who can speak English f l u ent ly as possible in or d er to im p ro ve my speak ing s k i ll s .
One of the op p or t un it ies is the less on with a n at ive speak er .
This less on is he l d almost every S at ur day .
The teacher is one of five A L T s ( A L T is the a b b re v i ation of As s it ant L an g u age T e a ch er ) who work in public school .
This less on is a quite p re c i ous op p or t un ity for me .
That ' s why it ' s very hard to find them in my are a .
The s i z e of a less on is so small that I can many ch ance s to talk in English .
A fter talk ing , we do some things by us ing a te x t .
F or ex amp le , we re m e m b er us e ful express ion s , play a ro le play , and make sen t ence s which con tain new w or d s .
L a st ly , we read an ar t ic le in new s p a p er and dis c us s it .
2 hour s always f l ies f a st .
I at ten d ed `` 76 meeting `` to day .
C o m p an y p re s id ent s b or n in 1 976 ga ther for it and 2 0 people came .
On the meeting , one make s a present ation about his comp an y every time , this time I made it .
A fter that , we dr un k to g e ther and had a f un .
There was a light s n ow f a ll yesterday at the ne i g h b or h o o d o f my home .
So far it has come w in ter .
I watch ed D V D `` W h o k il led the e le c t ri c c ar ? `` ; this is a do c u ment ar y f il m th ta de al s with the history of the e le c t ri c c ar , ma in ly f o c us ed on The G en er al M o ter s E V I .
This ty pe of c ar was in v ent ed to re d u ce a ir po ll u tion , the e mission of c ar b on di o x id e out of at m o s p he re about ten year s a g o .
When it was re le as ed at G M , it became sen s ation al , but dis a p pe ar ed and `` H a m m er `` was re le as ed in s te ad .
This is said ch i e f ly because the in f l u ence of B us h a d m in is t r ation and o il comp an y push ed out this en v ir on ment ally friend ly c ar .
T en year s la ter , now , we are con s c i ous of how we can be `` gr e en `` and P re s id ent O b a m a are going to en c o ur age the in ve n tion of this p u g - in e le c t ri c c ar .
The f il m is very impress ive to know the sit u ation in those days , and how strong po l ic y and comp an ies ' re l ation s are to p ur s u e each pro f it .
S e c on d of all , I `` d like to study fashion de s i g n .
J a p an e se fashion school do n ' t tea ch fashion de s i g n .
They only tea ch how to make c l o th es beautiful ly like the way of saw ing and ma k ing p at ter n s .
I `` d like make my story de e p ly and study how to express the story to every on e with strong impress ion .
There f or e I started to study in for e i g n country .
last night , I do n ' t know what wrong .
I just c a n ' t sleep , I us ed too many way to help me sleep , but that ' s c a n ' t help me .
No w , I am stay ing in school .
every c la s s I am sleep , I do n ' t know what ' s wrong .
I know I c a n ' t do that , but I c a n ' t make me do n ' t sleep in the class .
It is close to the C h ri st m as .
He answered the question , `` S e c re t ! `` .
tomorrow , I have only two class .
So I will go to g u id e to K I N K A K U J I temple .
There are beautiful G O L D E N P A B I R I O N in there .
D id you see it on p ic ut er or something ?
That is co ver d ed go l d .
And there are three st or i ed room .
F is r t is tea ce re m on y room , second is E m pe l i al room , th ir d is S a m ur a i room .
If you want to ent er in the se room , you can t do that .
you can only see from outside .
There are p on d front of the p a b ir ion .
I watch ed the W or l d S er ies last night and as most of you know , The Ya n ke es w on .
M o st am a z ing ly , M at s u i hi t remark ably and was ch o s en the M V P of this W or l d S er ies .
S in ce he had been probab ly the most p op ul ar play er in J a p an before came to the U S , many f an s were sh ock ed at his de c is ion of le aving J a p an e se le a gue .
However , most of the people are still ro ot ing him as `` M at s u i in the Ya n ke es `` .
I was a f an , too , but last night he turn ed to just my f o e .
In the in ter v i e w of M V P , he said `` I feel like in a dr e a m . `` That was a night m ar e for P h i ll ies f an s includ ing me .
A n y way , I enjoy ed watch ing the P h i ll ies ' game s and I want than k all play er s !
I am going to tra ve l in T ha il and on J un .
I have to re s er v ation of hotel in T ha il and .
I in ten d to re s er v ation on In ter ne t .
I would like to a t w in be d room and no n - s m o k ing room .
We are going to ar r ive at 6 : 2 5 p . m .
I should go to be d e ar ly though , I have a l ot of things to do .
I will do my be st and will be able to co m m un ic ate with my friend s in English f l u ent ly in the near future .
I got a great feel ing .
I was going to con t in u e it for a little while here a fter .
However , only s l i p p ing does n ' t take care .
I am not a p ic k y .
So , I ' d like to eat va ri ous co un t ri e ' s f o o d s .
There are many kind of f o o d s sp e c ul i ar to each co un t ri e in the world .
not c ar ing whether I look f at or not .
do a co up le of more things , but ne g le c ted them per f e c t ly to day .
for im p ro ve our e ng l ish .
You have ti p s for us ? W h i ch c ity do you re c o m m en d ?
Y o g a is in v o gue among my co w or k er s the se days and they are going to g y m almost every day after work .
They always re c o m m en d me do ing Y o g a , but I ' m afraid I ' m not in ter es in ex er c is e .
G e t ting the new s p a p er to ma il b o x is about the most ex er c is e I do .
B e t ter than nothing , ha !
I have con f ro n ted in need of to speak E l i g n s h in my office .
I study hard .
The very begin ing . . .
It ' s hard to start the new di ar y , es pe c i ally here .
It was a little b it b or r ing .
We are just try ing to c ar ry out an in ter ve n tion al study with J u ve n i le de l in qu ent s ' who m are a gr o up of 1 5 - 1 6 year old s a ccord ing to the b ook `` E X P L O R I N G F E E L I N G S : the C o g n it ive B e ha v i or The r a p y To M an age A ng er `` , which was tra n s la ted in J a p an e se .
There f or e I have con ta c ted D r / / / / / / , the a u th or of the b ook , so that we would have some a d v ic e for the pro g r a m ing .
And with regard to the ra ting s c al e and s c i ent if ic e v al u ation of the pro g r a m ( to comp ar e the pro g r a m ' s effect before and after ) , he suggest ed me to con ta c t you and told your e - ma il address .
We are p l an ing to me as ur e with the S t ate - T r a it A ng er E x p re s s ion In v ent or y - 2 ( S ch w en k m e z g er e t al .
1 99 2 ) for the e v al u ation study , but also think ing that it would be a b it difficult for some of the sub j e c t gr o up me m b er s .
That is why , it would be help ful , if you could give us some a d v ic e for the e b al u ation of the re se ar ch and provide the de t al s about the ra ting s c al es that were us ed in the b ook .
In my opinion , we s ter n you th s have more free d o m than their friend s in E aster n .
In many case s , they have to e ar n money for not only their living but also their family : they become the ma in e ar n er s .
So some time s they c a n ' t follow their dr e a m s , in s te ad they get job s they do n ' t like , as long as it b r ing s them much money .
A f e w people do n ' t give up but after s ever al year s , pass ion is not strong enough .
In other w or d , they s a c ri f ic e for their family .
E s pe c i ally you th s come from country s id es , they have already s u f f er de ar th s and not want their b ling s to do so .
To day , I ' m going to read law b ook after I has read l ot s of no ve l s .
No w , I must go to read .
B y e b y e !
Yes ter day ' s My English L es s on
Yes ter day my English con ver s ation teacher S e an and I took a very interest ing less on .
He suggest ed me that tell a lie in English .
When I told a like , I was very n er v ous to trick him .
B e c a us e I had to make two st or ies which one is tru e and the other is f al se and I also had to told them in English with same f a c i al express , voice to ne and so on .
My st or ies are like that ; when I was a you ng er , I was a to m b o y and most of my friend s were bo y s .
I like play ing game s with them and one of my favor ite game s was ma k ing f ro g bo m b s .
It was that I stuff ed f i re c r a c k er s into al ive f ro g s and th r ow away to w ar d to people .
My mo m was always up se t to my be ha v i or .
When I was three year s old , one day I was look ing at a was h ing machi ne and had c ur i ous about that .
While I was watch ing the mo ve ment , I do n ' t know why , but I want ed to try j um p into the watch ing machi ne .
A t the same time I re c o g n i z ed that I turn around with la un d ri es .
A ll my ha ir s came out and of course , I heard my mo m ' s s c re a m ing .
On the other hand , when I was a you ng er , I wish ed to do pe e with stand ing like my bo y s friend s .
When I play ed with them , I always did pe e with stand ing .
One day I tri ed to do pe e with one of my bo y s friend s from up st a ir s to w ar d to my da d ' s c ar .
We were stand ing on the b al c on y and did pe e .
When my mo m saw our pe e down st a ir s , she was re ally ma d to us .
D o you know which story ( turn ing around into was h ing machi ne or do ing pe e with stand ing ) is tru e ?
O f course , I do n ' t speak them in English though .
He ga ve me a copy of the so ng ' s ly ri c s , but I just s ing a begin ing of the so ng that `` I ' m dr e a m ing of a W h ite C h ri st m as just like the one s I us ed to know . `` That ' s all . . . .
There f or , I c he c k ed the me l o d y of the so ng on You t u b e and I ' m p r a c t ic ing now .
I want to read English no ve l s which is written by K ur t V on ne g ut .
I ' ll get express ion s and read ing know led g e of English te x t for my purpose in L an g - 8 .
B e c a us e I went to be d la ter .
to day to do l is t
To day I went to see an English speech con t est at un ive r s ity .
7 students p at ic i p at ed in it and they were great ^ ^ Some students did n ' t me m or i z e their s c ri p t enough not to see it but still I thought they made a l ot of e f f er t s .
To p ic s were all different , g l o b al w ar m ing , in ter ne t game a d d i ction , s u ic id e and so on .
I could n ' t catch all the w or d s that part ic i p ant s were speak ing but I enjoy ed it and it was re ally in f or m at ive for me to listen to a d v ic e from j ud g es .
It ta s te th ic k .
What C an We D o for To h o ku R e g ion ?
U p to now , the de a th to ll re a ch es at least f if te en th ous and and ten th ous and people are still mi s s ing .
A ccord ing to T V new s , there is still a l ot of de b ri s in de v a st at ed are a .
That is , it is ne ce s s ar y to re m o ve it im m ed i ate ly for re v it al i z ing there .
A l s o , the re g ion has a serious pro ble m on education en v ir on ment .
B e c a us e of the cha in of dis aster , the ch il d re n in the re g ion have not got enough education .
There f or e , since we have know led g e to tea ch them study to some ex t ent , we will be able to provide the education with them .
What we can do is to bu y as many pro d u c t s made in the re g ion as we can .
A t first , let me explain the S R I in de ta il .
However , in addition to the point s , the fact or of so c i al con t ri b u tion is being need ed .
The for m er in ve st 1 0 0 yen per a c l o th for To h o ku re g ion .
If we bu y the same kind of a c l o th , we will bu y it from the for m er .
There f or e , if you want to do so , I would like you to find such comp an ies c ar ry ing out S R I from va ri e ty in d ust ri es .
This is my as s i g n ment s at my un ive r s ity .
If you have time , please c or re c t my mistake !
us e ce ll p h on e in school .
Why can ` t we us e ce ll p h on e at high school .
E x a c t ly , it is not good thing to us e it .
While the class time ,
but I think that there is no reason us ing ce ll p h on es d ur ing the re st time and co m m ut e .
I c a n ' t English well .
I can good C or re ction .
W ow , I ' m look ing for w ar d to it than W or l d C up game .
This T V pro g r a m is very f a m ous in J a p an which name is `` K in - cha n no Ka s ot a ish o ( How do I say in English . . .
In this v id e o , m ul t i p le people perform ing to g e ther to for m a s k it of a girl f ri en d going c r a z y on her bo y f ri en d .
She ' s th r ow ing water , p l ate , p i z z a , sp a g he t t i e t c .
C o m ing home , my w if e and I talk ed about people we me t at the S ar a h ' s w ed d ing .
It ' s been almost more than ten year s since we got into the U n ive r s ity but some does n ' t see m to be gr ow ing up .
O h , I might be asked whether I am gr ow ing .
I sure ly can say ' y es , I am ' - at least ' y es , I did gr ow up in some are a . ' Well , it ' s not that I am pro ud of myself but th ir s ty for gr ow ing .
I work as an as s is t ant of a pro j e c t man age r tea m , and writing meeting not es is one of my ma in ta s k s .
There is a meeting almost every day , but it ' s still hard for me to understand what they are talk ing about .
That ' s why , a voice re c or d er is my ne ce s s ar y it e m .
What would you do if I said l o ve .
This is first work ing day in S ing a po re to day .
The re s ul t is no so bad .
And f o o d and life is good for me .
I had a dinner at f o o d - co ur t .
I said `` C an I have a take - out this ? `` .
( I do n ' t know this p h r a se is good or not )
Then s ta f f said `` take a way ? ``
The se are different ?
A n y on e help my question .
difficult !
W ri t ting English da ir y is first time to me .
So , I do n ' t write long da ir y .
I do n ' t go out .
he y ~ , How about the we a ther in you live ?
When I was a un ive r s ity st ud ent , I be l on g ed to y a ch t c l u b .
A l m o st every me m b er s had not y a ch ted before they j o in ed our c l u b .
However , we have had a go al that we will place in n ation al ch amp ion s h i p .
We have not a ch i e v ed the go al , but we will have cha ll e ng ed the go al .
I went to stand ing b ar s once a week or two .
I like stand ing b ar s than normal because it is c he e p er and I can co m m un ic ate other c ust ome r .
Some time s there are for e i g n er s in stand ing b ar s , and I get a ch ance that I talk them .
Some of my friend s , name ly H and F , and I had made a p l an to go on 2 days tri p to S en d a i d ur ing the 5 success ive ho l i day s , from S ept e m b er 1 9 th to 2 3 r d .
Yes ter day F sen t e - ma il to H and me .
A ccord ing to F ' s e - ma il , F s ud d en ly will have to make a business tri p from S ept e m b er 2 0 th , and F request ed us to mo d if y the tri p p l an d ur ing S ept e m b er 2 2 n d and 2 3 r d .
So we made again a p l an to go to O d a w ar a for a day on S ept e m b er 2 2 n d .
It take s around 2 hour s to come to school with train .
So in the train , I do something s like read ing a b ook , l is t n ing the m us ic and so on .
I was c he c k ing e m a il , study ing and then sleep ing to day .
In addition , I ' m also w r ing my j o ur n al !
I have started le ar n ing English at the age of 1 3 which was a j un i or high school st ud ent in J a p an .
S in ce there was not many for e i g n er s in my c ity at that time , I felt le ar n ing English was re ally fresh .
I gradua ted from un ive r s ity , at the same time , I qu it study ing English .
However , I re st ar ted study ing English for my better life since I do understood how English is im p or t ant in the g l o b al so c i e ty .
B o th the read ing pass age and the le c ture r in the listen ing part re f er to a question that di no s a ur s are w ar m - b l o o d ed re p t il es or not .
The read ing pass age ar gue s that di no s a ur s are like to day ' s ma m m al s and b ir d s are w ar m - b l o o d ed an im al s , but the le c ture r hold s an op po s ite point of view and ma in tain s this the or y is not very per s u as ive .
He re f ut es what is cited in the read ing pass age that the f o s s il in So u th D a k ot a in 1 993 is the e v id ence that can s up p or t that the or y .
The le c ture r ' s second point is that di no s a ur s do not have to a d a p t un st able c l im ate as how s n a ke s and l i z ar d s do to day .
C on t r ar y to what is me n tion ed in the read ing pass age that only w ar m - b l o o d ed an im al s can s ur v ive from the f ic k le te m p er a ture at that time , he op in es that the we a ther at that time is re l at ive ly mo d er ate than to day ' s , mean ing that there is no ex t re m e ly sh if t between high and l ow in te m p er a ture .
Besides , the f a st - cha ng ing we a ther te m p er a ture was never been re c or d ed .
L a st but not the least , the le c ture r con ten d s that big body s i z e do not ne ce s s ar i ly mean that having a w ar m ed - b l o o d s y s te m .
He agree s with the opinion of the read ing pass age that g i ant body need s a con st ant body te m p er a ture ; however , he believe s di no s a ur s like big sea t ur t le s have a l ow r ation of s ur f a ce to v o l um e , which can re d u ce he at - los ing , and that is able to keep them in a st able body te m p er a ture .
R e c ent ly , I of ten watch `` F R I E N D S `` , A m er ic an dr a m a s er ies .
Some ma g a z in es re c ome n d ed F R I E N D S for English le ar n ing .
B e c a us e , it s w or d ing is not so difficult and they speak natural English .
As a matter of fact , it is e as i er to listen to and understand what they say
than other dr a m as such as `` B O N E S `` ( in which there are too many te ch n ical terms ) .
And I enjoy it very much because the story it s el f is very funny .
But one pro ble m , , ,
J o ke s are some time s very difficult , es pe c i ally b l u e j o ke s .
They require us to have c ul t u al back g r ound s or un i qu e v o c a b ul ar y .
It re m in d s me of an e p is o d e .
a man told a j o ke but I only saw him b l an k ly .
In the future , when I will be able to enjoy every j o ke s in F R I E N D S ,
it ' s the time I re ally a c qu i re English s k i ll s .
I ' m a k i
but English is very difficult for me ! !
I ' d like to cha ll e ng e to take a T O E I C t est .
She said that she like to take a T O E I C t est because she get a l ot of en er g y from tak ing a T O E I C t est .
She has been study ing English for 3 hour a day .
I c a n ' t study English for a long hour .
Even if I have time to study English I will not study English .
A f e w days a g o I b ough t a C D and ra d i o play er .
I want ed to listen g m us ic in the bath room .
So I ' m feel ing like to sp en d ing ha p p y bath time to w ar m body .
( not only having a show er , but being into the ta b full ed w ar m water )
The way to sp en d my bath time is funny , is n ' t it ! ?
D e c id ed school
To day , I finish ed tri al less on at last .
And I de c id ed language school .
I ch o o se of school is a L S C .
But L S C was some different .
I do n ' t have watch ed the ma j or le a gue game .
C o ul d you explain the mean ing and give me some ex amp le of us age ?
T O E F L writing - a w a it s your re v is e ment !
F ro m my per s pe c t ive , I strong ly dis a g re e with the state ment that the help from go ver n ment is of ten not ne ce s s ar y since most people can so l ve their pro ble m s by themselves or with the help from their f a m il ies .
On the con t r ar y with the state ment , I believe that even people may receiv e help s some where else , the help s from go ver n ment , in some case s , is what c it i z en s need most , because of go ver n ment ' s a u th or it ies and t re m en d ous p ow er s .
Besides , off er ing va ri ous help s is a go ver n ment ' s o b l i g at or i ness , no matter such help would be regard ed as un ne ce s s ar y or not .
I w a k ed up 4 : 0 0 a . m . to go to the sea to s ur f this morning , but the w a ve s were too small to s ur f .
I in ten d ed to s ur f before job , but I can not .
A fter the job , I in ten d ed to s ur f again , but it is w n d y .
The a se days , I did not s ur f .
If I go to work 4 days , there is 9 - day week en d .
I can not wait it .
I just j o in L an g - 8 !
I ' m not sure how to us e L un g - 8 yet .
I ' ve st ud i ed English in C an ad a since this mo un th !
my English is poor but I ' ll study hard .
That ' s why it is my first day to day .
It see m s very help ful for me .
I ho pe I keep us ing it .
L a st night , I went to s us h i b ar with my co w or k er s and own er .
It was great time .
I le ar n ed many things from them .
In J a p an , when you have a to a st , you have to care about your sit u ation .
If you were you ng est , your g la s s should be little l ow er than other s .
It is the way to s ur v ive in bu se ness sit u ation my bo s s said .
I do n ' t w an n a go out , so just watch mo v ies to day !
My s k in is not so good .
I of ten go to de r m at o l o g y or take a s k in care .
I re ally want that my s k in become s m o o th !
U n f or t un ate ly my s k in become dr y , dr y and dr y . . . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! T .
I have a co l d with run n ing no se and head a ch e .
On the other hand , a ccord ing to a re c ent re se ar ch , V i e t n a m p op ul ation is get ting old f aster than any other country .
It ' s un e x pe c ted ly difficult to c or re c t a j a p an e se
To day , I c or re c ted some of j a p an e se ent ry .
but , It ' s un e x pe c ted ly difficult .
B e c a us e J a p an e se have va ri ous express ion s on one te x t .
m m m .
B y the way ,
I was am a z ed that there are many j a p an e se ent ry .
It ' s wonder ful to me .
I think that In ter est ing so different c i v il i z ation is very great to understand to g e ther for more ha p p y .
please do n ' t p i le up dis he s
She is very heart - w ar m ed person .
But she is n ' t good at house w or k , es pe c i ally was h ing dis he s .
Yes ter day a l ot of us ed dis he s were p il ed up at a k it ch en and I could n ' t be ar those left for a day .
So it ur g ed me to was h dis he s and I de al t them r ough ly with a ng er .
1 0 minute s la ter , my w if e came a cross to me and show ed me a w h ite c up .
She told it was present ed by her gr and m o ther who was already de ad .
My n um m er ho l i day s were to short , as usual ; - )
The reason why my school start s on T h u es day is , p up il s with the gra d e 5 in their school re p or t s can make a t est about the who le last year to get in the next high er class .
I am le ar ing E le c t ro n ic s with In f or m at ic s and C o m p ut er te ch n i qu es .
The a ust ri an school s are very un ive r ally that we know from everything a little .
It con s is t s many te ch n ical a c k n ow led g e ment s , but also sub j e c t s as G er man , English and E c on o m y will be asked .
But that the hard est and the most f e ar s ome t est is the `` F T K L Project `` ( tra n s la ted in e ng l ish : M an u f a c t ur ing and C on st r u ction D o c t ri ne ) .
A fter pass ing all t est s , I can de c id e to start work ing or go to an un ive r s at y .
But I think I will ch o o se work ing , because I am already sick of study ing > . <
A d d ion ally , after 2 year s work ex pe ri ence , I will get a ut o m at ic ally the ti t le `` E ng in e er `` .
I kind of thought that , as long as I write something in e ng l ish , some on e c or re c t my e ng l ish while sleep ing .
but I gue s s that s too good to be tru e .
and that s kind of s ad co z this is about in ter a c ting with re al person .
I gue s s I have to take an a ction in or d er to find some on e to c or re c t my e ng l ish ?
y e a h let me find some on e who need s my help .
some on e who is study ing j a p an e se in this case ?
al ri g h t where are they ?
can I just say he ll o to them ?
or a d d them ?
is n t it kind of a w k w ar d .
you don t have to c or re c t my e ng l ish .
just tell me how to us e this we b s ite first !
My be st friend is coming from J a p an in a week .
She is the first person who visit s me since I came to A ust r al i a .
It ' s not very long , still , I am so ex cited to see her .
We went to the same high school and went to the different co ll e g es .
She is now work ing the same b an k as I was work ing .
However , the first day , she is just le aving J a p an l ate in the even ing and the last day , She need s to take an e ar ly f light so We have got three full days off .
I wonder if 3 days are enough .
So I was s ur p ri z ed at cha ng ing this sit e ! !
I ' m enjoy ing my s um m er ho ri day , but I have a l ot things to do .
F ir st , I must do my home w or k .
We have a ta s k to write `` consider ing of a b ook `` .
I like read ing b ook s , but I ha te this home w or k !
I do n ' t know what to write . . .
To m or r ow , my ch il d h o o d friend s come s to my home .
We are to go k ar a o ke .
So , I will not be able to do my home w or k tomorrow .
I ' ll study by now . . .
C h ic k en C ur ry , S a f r an ri ce with J a p an e se U m e a p ri c ot , M i x ed dr i ed f r u it s N an , P e p p er m in t cha i with C in n a m on and S h o ch u , J a p an e se sweet po t at o w in e with Ka b o s u , O it a p re f e c ture ' s f r u it just like le m on .
I want to sleep more , but at the same time , I want to le ar n English more .
I ' m try ing to do all things if possible .
I am be at ing now
I am be at ing since yesterday .
The reason why I am so is my close friend will something g if t to me for my study English .
But may be I have get first ex pe ri ence .
So I am be at ing .
A S ad N e w s
I receiv ed a very s ad new s from my friend in Tokyo .
A ccord ing to her , one of our class m ate s in our pai n ting school di ed because of a can c er .
A c t u ally , I talk ed to her last month .
To be honest with you , I did n ' t like her because she was the person who said what ever was on her mind .
So , I was we a k in her .
When I cha t ted with her last time , it was my first time to see her in six month s .
I live in far from Tokyo , so I can not at ten d her f un er al .
L at ter ly , I ' ve had a run n y no se .
S ne e z e see m s to be my ro ut in e .
I always s ne e z e day and night .
In fact , I am all er g ic to co l d a ir so every time , if some on e s w it ch on the A C , I will s ne e z e la ter .
A f e w days a g o , I p l u c k ed the ha ir in my no se as it was too long .
M a y b e , I as s um e that I hu r t the ce ll of my no is e wall .
The most ex a g g er at ed thing is that the ti s s u e I us ed to blow my no se become mo is t to w e le t te .
But I wonder if it can be c ur ed with time .
When I was a second ar y st ud ent , two teachers t aught us English at the school .
M a in ly , J a p a se ne teacher t aught English gra m m er s , a c c ent s and va ri ous w or d s .
A no ther teacher who came from English speak ing country ( may b e The U .
I had never me t a for e i g n er then , as I live d in a small town in J a p an .
The J a p an e se teacher talk ed and talk ed to us in J a p an e se who le the class .
I did nothing but writing down what the teacher explain ed .
I ' d al w e y s like to have a pe t at home .
My mother was very s c ept ic to this idea , but my father full f il led my dr e a m and b ough t me b a ut i ful do g : ) I was very ha p p y and I sp ent almost all the time with my F ri en d .
But one day my do g dis a pe ar d and I c a n ' t find him any where .
No w I mi s s to my F ri en d and look for him through the w in d ow every day . . .
a y a m i ' is my s c re en name and re al name is A y a .
may b e I us e both here . . .
my ma j or is English and A m er ic an di p l o m a c y & history .
I am going to go to the un ive r s ity of G e or g i a from this A u g ust .
to day it was so o o o co l d and had a l ot of s n ow in O s a k a .
so I have been at home all day and listen ed the new al b um of D a v id G u e t ta ! ^ ^
I can not b or r ow it even if it already pass three or four month s .
to make matter s w or se ,
I have been made to b or r ow a b ook from six b ook s at once in all to day after all .
A ll the se are s light ly s ever e there for two week s .
But was the b ook which want s to all read .
I will con g r at ur ate start ing next year .
I do n ' t like dr in k ing very well but I say he ll o , he say s let ' s dr in k if you have a time .
A l th ough I do n ' t like dr in k ing , I like meeting the friend s .
I ' ll will c he er you on .
My name `` G al le `` is name d from a be a ut y s al on I go to .
I am a st ud ent at J a p an e se un ive r s ity .
But my English is bad es pe c i ally about speak ing , so I can have no w or d when ever I try to speak in English !
So , I want to study ' English of the moment ' in this we b s ite .
I ' ll write di ar ies as possible as I can .
P le a se c he c k my mistake s !
To day , I start L an g - 8 .
My e ng l ish le ve l is like a b a b y . . .

I was me t with my friend last night .
We did n ' me e t for a long time .
My friend is work ing on b an k and I am study ing ex a m in ation .

A l s o I do my be st to come tru e for my dr e a m s .
I thought that dr e a m s come tru e is difficult and need to hard effort .
I thought that I was read one of b ook at a l i b r ar y .
`` D re a m is eat ing be ad s of s w e at ( your effort ) , not a ra in b ow . ``
It ' s easy enough to understand , and it ' s quite ent er tain ing to watch .
I hu r t my bo y f ri en d .
I could n ' t stand his at t it ud e and I said to him re ally bad w or d s through an e m a il .
`` I know we have different va l us and thought s ,
but this is the w or st person to i g no re the question what you ' re as k ing .
So I try to re a c t no matter who I like or not .
But , you know , there ' s a person like that never care of other s .
It was about him but I never re f er r ed that because I just want him to
A fter sen d ing this e m a il I felt better , al th ough he did n ' t re p ly anything .
In the even ing I found that he had dis a p p er ed .
I took around I found him in a b ook room , and he was ar r an g ed . ( We ' re going to mo ve another bu il d ing near b y this month of 1 3 th . ) I spoke to him , he seemed to get a ng ry .
He seemed to be c ry ing because I not ic ed that his eyes out .
I re al i z ed my w or d s in j ur ed his mind . . .
I just want ed to not ic e my heart .
He was a p p ar ent ly got down and I propos ed going to dinner .
We need ed to talk each other yesterday .
If we mi s un d er st and each other , that would le ad us b re a k up .
I talk ed to him my tru e feel ing that I have felt the se days .
I tri ed just to be honest and open my thought s .
He was always care about what he did to me , and some time s he felt sorry for me .
And he said to me , `` I was going to b re a k with you , act u ally . `` J ust j o k k ing , but when I heard this , I re al i z ed that how bad thing I did for him .
What I was think ing for him was always my e g o is m , and when I saw his tea r s , I was re ally as ha m ed of myself .
When I b ro ke friend s h i p with a bo y friend in co ll e g e , he said to me , `` you ' re always think ing about your s el f .
This was one of the big g est de p re s s ed ex pe ri ence for my life and since then I tri ed to keep my mind about this .
Even if I l o v ed him in w or d , I did n ' t tru st him from heart s of my heart s .
I always want his re p ly , and re a ction because I want to find out his thought s , view s and va l u es .
This matter was bad things from one as pe c t , but some h ow I ' m re l i e f ed
to talk to him my thought s .
I went to F or t un e te ll ing last night with my friend s .
And I got a n ic e i nformation about my future .
R e c ent ly J a p an e se ten d to say that It ' s in c on s id er able to having an even t or f est i v al or kind s of things .
I understand why they say but D o they understand It will make s u f f er er s of e ar th qu a ke f a c ing even hard er sit u ation .

D e c line d e c on o m y make s people un ha p p y includ ing s u f f er er s .
I ' m con f us ed !
One of my friend s asked me such a this question .
I thought it but I could n ' t find proper answer .
If you read my b l o g and please c or re c t her answer in s te ad of me .
He r question is mean ing of the sen t ence as be l ow and that sen t ence is c or re c t or not .
This sen t ence is print ed on her so n ' s T - s u ir t s .
One day when her so n ' s English teacher watch ed that T - s u ir t s , He took picture s it and he said it is so funny !
So my friend an x i ous about the mean ing of that sen t ence , If it is includ ing s l un g or bad mean ing s .
I tri ed to tra n ce l ate it but it ' s a little b it compli c at ed .
I ' m sorry to both er you .
L on g time no come here ,
because my work was very bu s y .
And I started new b l o g in J a p an e se here .

I ' ve been to U S A for two month s at three time s .
I think I a c qu i re it with la ng - 8 .
I was a first c ar at sign al on the right la ne to make a turn right there .
Then , what happen was that the c ar on my left pass ed my c ar and turn ed right on re d sign al .
This c ar was on the middle la ne at the time .
In the last se m est er , things got very me s s y .
I might not be able to keep my pro m is e for the who le se m est er but I ' ll try .
I might try to raise the number of ent ri es per week after I get a de c ent know led g e of S p an ish .
I did n ' t even have any time to think about pro c r a st in at ing this one .
But as F la w less gr o up from B ri tain ' s got t al ent said , `` C ha se the dr e a m , no the comp e t i tion . `` I just ho pe that I could make it , not ne ce s s ar i ly before the end of the comp e t i tion but it ' d be n ic e if it was a c c o m p l ish ed for the gradua tion pro j e c t .
I keep push ing myself to always be op t im is t ic , but there are some moment s when I find this a very hard thing to do , who does n ' t ? !
This qu ot ation is the only thing that keep s me try ing .
I ho pe it does the same thing for you too .

That was a n ic e look ing re st a ur an on the hi ll around a beautiful for est t .
It was a co l on i al style ( s ing a po re co l on i al house is called black and w h ite ) , and found ed in 1 9 0 8 .

The re s a ur ant was close d on every s un day !
We want ed to eat anything , any where so we had a l un ch in a near ma c d on al d ( my hu s b and like s ma c ) .
A fter l un ch , we took a walk around the p ar k .

F or that reason , I re ally looked for w ar d to see ing her .
On the first day , we did not work on any cha p ter of the te x t b ook .
She did not b r ing it , because she thought it is more im p or t ant to get to know each other .
It mean s she did not re a ch the le g al dr in k ing age yet .
I have a difficult y ma k ing long sen t ence s and can not keep talk ing about one sp e c if ic to p ic .
She also asked me to feel free to as k what ever I want to know .
She let me know her ce ll p h on e number and I did the same .
We set a future s ch ed ul e and said good - by e to each other .
L a st month , go o g le was at ta c k ed from ch in e se serve r s .
But it appear s that go o g le has already got re ve ng ed for the at ta c k er s .
A b o ve ar t ic le s are very interest ing and f ri g h ten ing .
I got up at 6 : 3 0 am at hotel in Y o k o ha m a .

To day , I went to the d ent is t after long time in ter v al .
I was suppose d to go on 1 st M ar ch , but I c ance led the a p po in t ment .
I pro c r a st in at ed it because I was too bu s y re c ent ly and my te e th did n ' t a ch e any more .
To day , I had free time and f in ally go there .
I think my te e th never a ch e any more , but I have to have my te e th and the f il ling kept c le an .
To day , I con ta c ted to next bo s s .
N e x t bo s s said , you sha ll le ar n English .
B e c a us e , bo s s ho pe I con ta c t to for e i g n comp an ies .

I thought it is j o ke .
But it is not j o ke .
P er ha p s , I will visit to P h il i p p in es a f e w month s la ter .
That was the first time that I had ever see n the who le town had no e le c t ri c ity and got comp le te ly dark .
No e le c t ri c ity mean s that everything includ ing tra f f ic light s , street light s , st ation s does n ' t work comp le te ly .
Yes ter day , I had black o ut for three hour s and d ur ing that time , I stay ed home and play ed the a c ous t ic g u it ar because there was nothing expect play ing the a c ous t ic g u it ar .
I could n ' t turn ed on my P C , I c a n ' t c ook anything with my k it ch en which works with e le c t ri c ity and I could n ' t read any b ook s .
No w I ' ve been wonder ing when our life will get back normal .
It is not a bu is i ness tri p !
I ' m going to visit S i man e K en to this S un day and
I ' m p l an n ing to go to I z um o - T a is y a on S ut ur day .
I ' m little a f f r a id that I c a n ' t get ti c ke t to see around I z um o - T a is y a ,
because there has sp e c i al ex h i b i tion in this s um m er that is
once 6 0 year s .
I gue s s there is many to ur is t s .
B e f or e farewell part y for my friend , we went to S un se t be a ch .
I ' m try ing to a b s or b it as like it ' s a kind of de st in y for us who are coming to U S to study English .
I ' ve already sen t l ot s of friend s .
So tomorrow I will go to L A X to sen d her .
A n y way I went to S un se t be a ch .
We s w a m a l ot for to t al 2 hour s .
T h an k s to that , I got pai n in my who le body to day .
As you know , there are two kind s of way to study .
You will talk with your friend s , you and your friend s want to play outside , but there are n ' t any p ar ent s who will mo r t if y about this things , there f or e you may play outside and do n ' t study .
However , if we study alone , normal ly we study in our home , so there is n ' t any part n er to talk , al th ough we re ally want to play outside , there is n ' t enough friend s to play , and your p ar ent s will mo r t if y about this .
Some say s : It ' s he al th i er for the body to e ther la y or sleep at the gr ound .
However , When I first mo v ed to my new house I have been sleep ing for one week at the gr ound .
F ir st ly my n ic k was almost b ro ke : (
but after two days I got us ed to it , also I felt more re la x ed .
In addition , I did n ' t find a be d yet .
I re g ul ar ly do j o g g ing 3 or 4 k il ome ter s once a week .
To day , al th ough I did n ' t know what I was think ing , but I de c id ed to run to the near est sea that is about 3 0 k il ome ter s and back .
I become a f an of this sit e .
This is easy to study and I enjoy us e this .
But I do only writing in this sit e .
M an y teacher c or re c t my sen t ence s and tea ch me .
And I can also study in short free time .
T h an k s the own er and every us er of this sit e .
U n like the co m m o m un ive r s ity with more bu il d ing s and less p l ant s , C ha ng s ha U n ive r s ity is more beautiful than a ga r d en .
G e t ting into the school ga te , you will enjoy a feel ing of back ing to the nature .
W and er ing on c amp us , gr e en tree s , co l or ful f l ow er s and clear water catch your sight , p le s ant s m e ll of f l ow er s o c c up ies your no se , and the s u on d of read ing al o ud and whisper ing of b ir d s c a p c u ture s your e ar s .
What ' s the better , the ro ad is so c le an that you almost c a n ' t find any r u b b ish , even a piece of was te paper .
What you feel is that , far away from the no is e of down t ow n , study ing and living in the un ive r s ity is more close to your heart , and the quiet en v ir on ment also con t ri b ut es to conc er n t r at ing your at ten tion on study .

It ` s a f e w hu s b and who do all a f house ke e ing like N e w Z e al and er , but more and more me n began to be interest ed in their home .
A c t u ally , one of my da d ` s ho b b y is p re s s ing shirt s with ir on on S un day .

The last 3 day s we e had very good We t ter , but t day it s c l o ud y again . . .
da m .
O o o and our new C ook has left , he ment it would be to much work .
I don t understand him in this time you can be ha p p y to have every work , well w at I now im just 2 0 year s old .
So o that s al for to day I think .
It ' s been about twenty days since the w in n er s of A c ad e m y A w ar d s an no un c ed .
A ll the w in n er s de s er ve to get this a w ar d s ?
S ur p ri s ing ly she has been no m in at ed a bu n ch in her long care er .
S pe a k ing of M er y l S t re e p , I found a n ic e v id e o on You T u b e called `` M er y l S t re e p read s The V el ve te en R a b b it . `` When my ch il d re n were small , I read this story for them and I like d it .
I c aught a call from my friend , who se b ir th day is on that day .
He want ed to be ce le b r at ed his b ir th day by me , so I ce le b r at ed him .
He is not an usual man .
Then my friend los t his p ur se in the train from K um a m ot o to H a k at a .
There f or e we went to the con ta c t c ent er in the st ation and the police st ation to as k if the p ur se was found .
T w o hour s la ter it was found , so we a p p re c i at ed people who help us .
Then I went back to my home t ow n on 3 0 th D e ce m b er .
I me t some friend s in re c ent days , and will go to C h i b a tomorrow .
I would like to stay more at my home t ow n , but I ' ll start to work on 4 th J an u ar y .
I w an n a work near my home t ow n some day .
I ' m not good at English , but I want the friend in the for e i g n country .
to day are my favor ite s ing er de b ut ten year s old .
Even t u ally English class finish ed to day . . .
I think the ter m of 1 month was very short , but it was very l u c k y to me e t a good teacher .
He is from C h i le but he had live d in A m er ic a from his you th life .
T h r ough the effort s of him , I could im p ro ve my English co m m un ic ation s k i ll a little b it than the past time ' s .
F or in st ance , when the class started , he always said to us one question , `` What happen ed yesterday ? `` .
When I got his question at first class , I could not answer about it well .
O f course I had my intention s so I wish ed to say to him but I could not answer at all .
But as days go by , I could gradua l ly a d a p t to his question .
So if I have my intention s now , I can bra in st ro m idea s and tell anything .
A l th ough it is not yet per f e c t but I feel my s k i ll s ex a c t ly up g r ad e .
A n y way I feel so s ad with part ing from him . . .
I only have good me m or ies and leave . . .
and I think I will be not able to me e t like him again in the hard world .
It will be very p re c i ous me m or ies to me . . . , so I ho pe to get them unti l de ad . . .
a d d i o s . . .
S k y pe ! my first time !
I talk ed with my friend of high school day s on S k y pe ! !
This was my first time to talk on it 8 )
It ' s an e po ch - ma k ing in ve n tion .
I think I ' ll be very n er v ous that time : 3
In my opinion , a good an im ation has three e le ment :
n ic er s c ri p t : F ri st , you must gra b people ' s f o c us , what you want to say and the con t ent whether make f an s keep on it .
S u it able back g r ound m us ic : This is im p or t ant , and I think A good m us ic is spirit of mo v i e .
That can make people more e as i er put them s el f into the dr a m a .
O f c ous e , act or ' s de s i g n and it s a ction are im p or t ant . . ha ha a like this o c t op us . . it let me feel very c ut e even though without any line s .
