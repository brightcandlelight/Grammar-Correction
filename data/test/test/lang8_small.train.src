And when I was bu c k to my home town in O s a k a
A girl see m to be in pro ble m

She is from A ust l al i a
there f or e I was try ing to speak with her , when we took the same train
when i was over sea to tra ve l
Some time s I have got to help from l o c al people

That why
I want to help for people who see m s to be in pro ble m
I had a ch ance to talk with co st um er who is K or e an

There were so many sh op s and game p la ce
such as T a k o y a k i , Y a k is o b a , O d en , F r an k f ur ter
and we had a respon s i ble for s el ling To n j ir u which is J a p an e se - s o up
It was so hard work
But M an y ch il d re n see m ha p p y
I could have a good time
I began to le ar n e ng l ish when I was about 1 6 year s old
I had for about four year s e ng l ish now
F or four week s I was in the U K to le ar n e ng l ish
I was in c a m b ri d g e and le ar n ed a l ot
The school I was there was the st ud i o school
But since last year , i have a re ally bad e ng l ish teacher
In my opinion my e ng il s h s k i ll s went some s te p s back since I have this teacher
So i began to le ar n j a p an e se - by myself
I le ar n ed more j a p an e se then e ng l ish last year
I don ' t have a j a p an e se teacher , but i th n i k i le ar n ed more j a p an e se then e ng l ish since i have this e ng l ish teacher
A t the moment I can all the k an a and about 2 0 0 k an j i

I think it s e as i er to le ar n s te p by s te p
So I le ar n the v o c a b ul ar y , gra m m at ic and the mean ing s of the k an j i
A l s o I listen to J a p an e se P o d 1 0 1
It ' s very help ful because i don ' t have a j a p an e se teacher
The pro no un c ing is very difficult to le ar n without any on e who can speak j a p an e se
While I am le ar n ing j a p an e se , I don ' t want to for g ot e ng l ish , so I write here to im p ro ve e ng l ish
My e ng l ish teacher can ' t re ally help me
I am a f f r a id , that I am not good enough to write in J a p an e se
I just can speak some short sen t ence s like ' ? ?
You see , I write all in Ka n a , because I did n ' t le ar n ed a l ot k an j i
I ho pe I will le ar n a l ot j a p an e se
The re se ar ch is about " F o ur i er tra n s f or m and D i g it r al im age pro ce s s ing

When I was going for a mo on light str o ll this night , I heard that " b e ll - r ing ing " c ri c ke t s were s ing ing
I re c o g n i z ed that the s um m er is f in ally end and the a ut um n is f al ling

C ro s s b i ke is sha p ed like ro ad b ic y c le and M T B
But it is ar r an g ed for town - us e
I had re ally want ed for month s
But f in ally , I got one
The sh op s ta f f told me that this was the hot - se ll ing this year
I ro d e from the b i ke sh op to home on it right after I p ur ch as ed
It was 3 0 minute s ri d e
It was great to ri d e ro ad way
There were n ' t any bu m p y things , so I could go re ally f a st
But I of ten had to stop and turn my face back because there were so many tax is c ar s p ar k ing on the street s
My b i ke does n ' t have a stand , so I l if ted it up and brought it in front of my a p ar t ment which is on the 3 r d floor
The f r ame is al um in um made , so it is light as a f e a ther
H m m
I ' m still s u f f er ed from a head a ch e
I ' m going to a b s ent myself from class es tomorrow
G o o d night every on e
I ' m sorry that I could n ' t re p ly your commen t s and me s s age for a f e w days
It was a three days and 2 night s even t
And we talk ed about our dr e a m all night long
I was str u g g ling with er r or s unti l the last train
When I came back home , it was already past mi d night
Then I had a small supper
It ' s already half past 4 now
This is just a begin n ing
Even the f a m ous g en er al of ? ? er a , ? ? , had been there to p r a y for a v ic t or y before the b at t le of ? ?
In the sit e of the sh ri ne , there was the t re as ur y that he l d l ot s of t re as ur es

There f or e many of ar t s and works have been de d ic at ed to ? ? con ve n tion ally
But there were also many beautiful s a m ur a i sword s
I could n ' t believe some on e act u ally us ed it at the b at t le s
But I did n ' t become we ar y at all
It was re ally s n u g place
Then we went to ? where is down t ow n N a g o y a and my j un i or j o in ed
There is the F er ri s w he el in the middle of down t ow n N a g o y a
? ? had long ed to ri d e it
So we ri d e it
A l th ough she had long ed to ri d e it so much , she was a f e ar of he i g h t
So she was quiet when we were in the go n d o la the who le time
D on ' t you think be ar s en able you to speak English more f l u ent ly ? l o l
I wish they had same feel ing s as mi ne
I re ally re g re t I could n ' t write a j o un al yesterday
When I got home , it was already past 1 2 : 0 0
I was writing this j o ur n al on the be d , but I f e ll as le e p
The s in i or s some time s l in k da i ly things to te ch n ical terms
F or in st ance , when a guy was b ash ful while he was talk ing about his girl f ri en d , the other s ho ot ed at him like
Then the guy re t or ted like
I am still s el f - re st or e able
They are e ar n est to th i er re se a ch es
And they have l ot s of ex p ar t know led g e
I am so glad to to be in c or p or at ed as a me m b er of the la b
D r a w a be ad on s ke le t on s , s y n th es i z er
What I think she want s to say is , it ' s easy to be in the cha r t s or follow the mo d e
The most im p or t ant thing is to c re ate the so ng s which never get s f ad ed and are a d m ir ed by every on e without regard to age or mo d e at all time
O H M Y G A S H
I still have n ' t finish ed my home w or k yet

J a p an e se , however , had n ' t have the proper w or d which sign if ies " l o ve " because of the sen s i b il it ies and ly ri c is m
When one of his students put " I l o ve you " into J a p an e se as ? ? " , he w ar n ed him against that translation
J a p an e se should put it into like " ? ? " ( w h i ch mean s " The mo on look s more beautiful to night " ) in s te ad
I think what he mean t was that " l o ve " is the feel ing that make s the mo on look s b ri g h ter than the mo on you see by your s el f
P re v i ous ly of my last j o ur n al ent ri es
A fter the c a ke bu f f e t , we saw off ? ? and P or s ch la at the bu s st ation
I ' ve been there a co up le of time s before
So they must have a great time there
They had a free day on F ri day because the f light would de p ar t S at ur day after no on
When they got down the bu s s , they looked re ally tired
I thought it was because of the long way of mo un tain ro ad
I might have other ch o ic e then
But I de c id ed to take them to A t s ut a S h ri ne
So many people go there for str o ll s
I turn ed on a T V im m ed i ate ly

While I was walk ing through the p ar k , some h ow my wall e t f e ll off from my pocket

There were some c ash c ar d s , credit c ar d s , my dr ive r l ic ence , and other stuff in my wall e t
But my wall e t was take n to the police bo x by a kind gentle m en
Some h ow the police office r knew it

I had been having t ough days
I could n ' t stand without pai n k i ll er s unti l co up le days a g o
I still have big ho le s in my mo us e , yet I can eat anything I want now
He re is 2 a . m . now
I went to the ot o la ry ng o l o g y after school to day
I had to wait about 2 hour s there
Then I went to the dis p en s ar y to get some me d ic in es on the p re s c ri p tion which the do c t or w ro te me
Then I had a dinner at home and talk ed with my friend on the p h on e for an hour and half
Then I cha ted with M im i for a hour
So I don ' t have much time to write this j o ur n al ent ry because I have to get read y to go school before I go to be d
So this time , I just in t ro d u ce my favor ite so ng
A c t u ally , it was my first time to go around Tokyo since I was in the 3 r d your of j un i or high school
I stay ed at my friend s house s who are going to un ive r s it ies in Tokyo for 3 days , and we had dr in k every night
I got home from Tokyo F ri day even ing
And I left my house and went to my other friend s ' house right away
M o st of my old p al s ga ther ed in his house and we had dr in k all the night
I tell you tru ly
A c t u ally , my friend did
I was just watch ing while he was having a difficult time as se m b ling it
I had p ul led out my w is d o m te e th yesterday
It still hu r t s so bad
So the pai n k i ll er is ne ce s s ar y all day
I ho pe it will get re c o ver ed by this week en d at the l ate st
And now my face is p u f f ed up like a b a ll o on
I re ally w an n a s k i p the class es on M on day
I still have s light head a ch e and stuff y no se
And I feel di z z y
I think the f ever already pass ed away
A n y way , I can ' t stay on the be d any m or e
I b ough t a co up le of b ook s about T O E F L
H a ve any on e take n T O E F L before
I ' m think ing to take that t est this s um m er
T O E F L has writing se ction
So I ' m going to write j o ur n al ent ri es along the po l ic y of T O E F L writing se ction
I have to finish some pe p or t s to night
I co ud n ' t be ar !
S m o k ing is similar to s um m on the M e p h is t op he le s
It will give you a no m in al re l i a f
But you will have to re pe at a sp e ll every 4 hour s
But I know
I live in 1 0 0 0 k m away from te m b l or ' s e p ic ent er
No ne th e less I felt sha k i ness in my house
I p r a y for that da m age s w on ' t ex ten d any more
I ex pe ri ence d so many things which were be y on d po s s i b il ity in J a p an
And now she is a fresh m en of L u ther C o ll e g e
I had never ri d d en a bu ll e t train for a while
So I was w or ri ed about if I could see her
To day was the first day of this school year of the la b I be l on g
This is the We b s ite of the la b
The re g ion s of re se ar ch of this la b or at or y are E le c t ri c P ow er E qu i p ment and H i g h E le c t ri c F i el d p h ne m en on
I ' m in my 4 th year of N a g o y a U n ive r s ity now
I ' m in e x pe ri ence d and my comp e t ence for re se a ch ing is not enough
So I am going to knock myself out to le ar n as many as possible from great p rofessor s and sen i or s
My dr e a m is to be a p rofessor of the re a g ion of E le c t ri c P ow er E qu i p ment and As se t man age ment
To re al i z e my dr e a m , I must do my possible
I ho pe every on e had a great day of C h ri st m as
The name of b and is " ce l and a in e
He is a le ad v o c al is t of the b and
And he also write so ng s for the b and
They have been a w ar d ed the first p ri z e of a b and comp e t i tion which was all te en age b and s in J a p an could ent er
So I am not sure if that name mean s proper ly
To day I went to the Y F U meeting for the long - ter m stay ing over se as students
They ar ri v ed here 2 month a g o
And they are le aving this w in ter
He could write the k an j i of " ?
We talk ed about why they de c id ed to come to J a p an and what they like of J a p an
M o st said that they re ally l o ve the f o o d of J a p an
F or t un ate ly , the ex h i b i tion of the J a p an e se ar t was he l d on the same floor of where we were having the meeting
And it was for free to a d m it
So I took every on e into the ex h i b i tion
So if you blow it , it will be de st ro y ed
And he took the picture s of us for free
And then they treat ed us to ma t ch a and cha - g ash i by co ur te s y of them
It was the re ally good ex pe ri ence
And I re ally a p p re c i ate their many kind ness to us
I c ough t a co l d
I got a co l d
So I take a day off to write a j o ur n al ent ry
G o o d night every on e
I ' m going to be d
I don ' t like ra in y sea s on
M an y in d i v id u al s believe that n u c le ar p ow er p l ant s are consider able da ng er
The C h er no b y l dis aster left un f or g e t t able da m age s d u e to the ex p l o s ion of the p l ant and re le a se of the ra d i ation
M an y co un t ri es , however , de c id ed to re c on s id er of n u c le ar p ow er p l ant de ve l op ment
So I w ro te f e w line s along the te x t b ook
It was re ally hard to write as A c ad e m ic writing
But if I keep writing like this , I think I will get good s c or e at the T O E F L t est
D on ' t you think so
The we a ther for e c a st said the ra in will go on for this week
I think it ' s a little b it e ar ly to set in the ra in y sea s on
I ' m think ing to man g e my da i ly s ch ed ul es in English
I ' m think ing to man age my da i ly s ch ed ul es in English

The s c or e of the T O E I C will be con ver ted into the s c or e of the English
And 9 0 5 point s will be con ver ted to 1 0 0 out of 1 0 0
What I mean t is I am f in ally read y to conc ent r ate upon the entrance ex a m in ation of the gradua te school
We hold a 2 day or i ent ation of t Y F U ex change st ud ent pro g r a m
I me t some for m er friend s at high school
We talk ed about our sen se s of va l u e
And we talk ed about our future care er
My gr and p a f in ally pass ed away
I am going to see the ch er ry b l o s s a m s with my la b me m b er s and p rofessor s
I was transfer ed to the 3 r d gra d e of N a g o y a U n ive r s ity from To y ot a N ation al C o ll e g e of T e ch no l o g y last year
So last year I ex pe ri ence d my first c amp as life
A t the big g in n ing of the school year , I had almost no friend in the un ive r s ity
But now I am a ur r ound ed by many friend s , sen or s and j un i or s
I re c i e v ed so many gr e e ting s yesterday
F ro m friend s , f a m il i y , friend s in U S , ho st family and so on
T h o se me d e me re al i z ed I had been s up p or ted by so many people
And those ga ve me p l ent y of push
I am going to set about the ma th se ction of the entrance ex a m in ation for gradua te school tomorrow
It ' s been 2 month since my last j o ur n al
T im e f l ies very f a st
I ' ve been through so many st im ul at ive ex pe ri ence s the se days
But this mar g in is too small to con tain
F er m at ' s p h r a se
I ' ve been st ic k ing on my gradua tion re se ar ch , stay ing over night in the la b t w ic e a week
But f in ally I ' m re al i z ing the f un of re se ar ch
G o ing to a A m us e ment p ar k with ex change students
I had to do so many t ough stuff s like having a present ation in front of all of the la b me m b er s and p rofessor s
But they never re m a in in my bra in
I feel like I just con t ent myself with read ing English , but I le ar n ed nothing
I gue s s I need to put more str es s on English
The c ent er p i e ce of the ri d es is the ro ll er co aster called " S te el D r a g on
It was on the G u in ness B ook as the world ' s ta ll est , f a st est and long est ro ll er co aster
Some of them were b ro k en
I am not good at s c re a m machi ne s
But one of them who is from M i ch i g an re ally like s those kind of things
So I was dr a g g ed to them
I ch ic k en ed right in front of it s p l at f or m once
I had been having a p re j ud ic e for a long time
It was way much f un n er than I thought
It ' s been a while since last time I w ro te my j o ur n al
S or ry about I have n ' t been able to give you any help for a month
But I ' m done with all ex a m s
This mean s begin n ing of 2 month s of sp r ing b re a k
I ' m try ing to write a j o un al at least once in a 3 days
And I ' ll try to give you what help I can
B y the way , I found beautiful line s written by M i y a z a w a K en j i
But I don ' t know how to put it into English
F l ow er s ra in ing in the s k y , we call them star
S t ar s sh in es on the e ar th , we call them f l ow er
Some th ing like this
What J a p an e se go ver n ment said and what for e i g n p re s s said di f f er ed in many account s
M a y b e J a p an e se go ver n ment has been try ing to con t ro l i nformation to a v o id p an ic
But this back f ir ed
M an y people are dis ar r a y ed
Tokyo E le c t ri c P ow er C o m p an y was one of the most se c ur ed large comp an ies
But that day , it f e ll off
No th ing is certain
In addition to the my last j o ur n al , my b ir th day is place d at the end the sea s on of that ch er ry tree s are in full b l o s s o m
I went out to the p ar k with my friend s to enjoy a p ic n ic under the ch er ry b l o s s o m s on my b ir th day
The p ar k was con g est ed with many people
So it was not like enjoy ing the ta s te ful ga r d en s
But people were having f un with be er bo t t le s in their hand s and the f o o d s of s ta ll s
As the time ro ll s on , people are los ing their heart s to l o ve the nature
But they still have heart s to l o ve and enjoy having f un with friend s
this is not what I was going to write
So see you then
? P R ? M y be st friend ' s b and is re le as ing the ma j or de b ut al b um on 4/ 2 1
He is a one of my be st friend s
We went to the same school and had been in a same class for five year s
I ' ve written a j o ur n al about him and his b and a while a g o
A t that time , I asked you for some help for the name of the ma j or de b ut al b um in be h al f of him
He ho p se his so ng s will be your f i re and w ar m your heart
E n j o y ing our live s is im p or t ant thing
But while we live in each n ation s , there are respon s i b il it ies and o b l i g ation s
I re ally re f le c t on myself about this
The sub j e c t was " I s it possible that each of the people all over the world us es the same am o un t of en er g y that a J a p an e se us es now
A t no dis t ant d ate , the time may come when people will have us ed up all the o il
But if the b la d e is da m age d by light n ing and need re p la ce ment , the w in d must be s light enough to under ta ke the con st r u ction work s a f e ly
This mean s that op er at ing a w in d p ow er g en er at or require s con st ant and p ow er ful w in d but it must stop per i o d ic ally
So I think I should go to be d a b it than e ar l i er to night
I will write more about the en er g y pro ble m some time not dis t ant d ate
I have a do c t or ' s a p po in t ment tomorrow morning
So I had to finish it to night and leave him to turn it tomorrow morning
I have n ' t had dinner yet
S or ry about I ' ve been un able to c or re c t your j o ur n al s the se days . ( ; ? ; `
So c or re c ting your j o ur n al ent ri es from that comp ut er is re ally hard to do . ( ?
So I ' m think ing to b r ing the la p t op comp ut er which I usual ly us e at home to the la b , and leave it for some time
F ur ther m or e , my gradua tion re se ar ch could be a kind of s im ul ation stuff , I think
D on ' t you think so
But I de c id ed to do it to s a ve my money
But it ' s go n n a be much more p ow er ful than one s made by man u f a c ture r s
I ' m think ing to us e some w i re she l f s which I ' ve kept outside
They are co ver ed with r ust so bad
I have the B B Q and hi k ing this week en d
I gue s s this go n n a take a while
I did n ' t have a re f ri g er at or
So I us ed to take me al s at school c a f e ter i a or just bu y some con ve n i ence f o o d
And by g i g ant ic c ity , I mean it ' s Tokyo
F e ng - S u i de r ive s from C h in e se long time a g o
But It had been us ed in J a p an since me d i e v al time s for a long time
And the queer mo n k , ? ? , re ar r an g ed who le c ity of E d o under the F e ng - S h u i ' s do c t ri ne
To make a long story short , he change d the name s of place s around the c a st le
He also place d many temple s and J a p an e se style ga r d en under the F e ng - S u i
M an y of J a p an e se are not a w ar e of it
I was at the " T a c o s P at y " last night
A ll part ic i p ant s works for Y F U as a volunteer
The second picture is of the had m ad e ti r a m is u
One of them had the b ir th day re c ent ly
It was ta c o s part y but also her b ir th day part y
It ' s been a week since last time I w ro te a j o un al
L a st T h ur s day , I was present at the part y
That part y was a im ed for le ar n i g English con ver s ation
This kind of part ies are he l d per i o d ic ally
But this was my first time to take part in
And I wait ed them about 3 0 minute s under the co l d we ther
We could dr in k as much dr in k s as we want
I dr un k l it ter s of G in To n ic
We only had English con ver s ation s
But also it was f un to talk with J a p an e se who are interest ed in English
I for g ot about that this was my f ir t st time and enjoy ed speak ing English
T h o se picture s were take n at there
I am the guy who is a c c id ent ally k is s ing with 4 2 old guy in the second picture . )
A r ound 2 2 : 3 0 , people started le aving if not they were mi s s ing the last train s
Then we m o v ed to next place
We walk ed about 1 0 or 2 0 minute s with a str a g g er ing ly
We talk ed about many funny things ( m o st ly in d e c ent things ) at there
We stay ed at there unti l morning
I have T O E I C t est in a month s
I did n ' t write a j o un al en ry last night . p ( ? ? ) q
But the comp ut er which is provide d for me by the la b was re ally s l ow
I tri ed to un in st a ll some a p p l ic ation s and did a v ir us c he c k
It took co up le hour s
Then works h op started
When I got to home , it was past 1 0 p . m . ( > ? <
I still could w ir te a j o un al but I was too ex ha st ed
I need to be more s te ad i ly
And sleep s only a hour
He say s his be d is too co m f or t able
He might sleep more than a hour if he sleep s in the be d
I don ' t know if a hour is enough for me
I feel pro ud of J a p an
I also feel s ad for the los se s of those c ul ture
The G o l d en We e k start s tomorrow
There are many different the or ies regard ing what mo t ive te s hu man being to act in the way s in the what they do
I agree with the l at ter position because all hu man act i v it ies have something to do with so c i e ty which e m b r a ce the other people
U l t im ate ly any kind of hu man a ction s are mo l d by affect ion to other s
And I ' m in the middle of the se ction about " I n t ro d u ction . " he he
No w I ' m w r ing a paper about the c ur r ent s state and f ut er e pro s pe c t s of the en er g y s up p ry in J a p an
I ' m ex a m in ing the re ne w able en er g y and the n u c le ar p ow er
The more I le ar n , the more o b v i ous that the de ve l op ment of the n u c le ar p ow er p l ant is reason able
I don ' t think I could write what I in ten d ed proper ly
But , " H as te make s was te s ! " , " S ta y c al m ! " and " B e co o l
M o st of people say E m in e m is one of the co ar s est ra p p er s in history of m us ic because of his be ha v i or , w or d s and his so ng s which are st ud d ed with in s ul t s
He has put a f f ro n t s upon many ce le b ri t ies in his so ng s such as M i ch el J a c s on , E l v is P re s le y and even his ex - w if e
A so ng which is in his 3 r d al b um , however , show s those of his in s ul t s might be not his re al intention
This so ng which you might he ve not heard of is name d " H a il i e ' s So ng
H a il i e " is his d aught er ' s name
P le a se turn off or put your ce ll p h on e into s il ent mo d e while the show
the " H a il i e ' s so ng
There is a hu g e for est which no one can t re s p as s on it s ho ly gr ound in the middle of the c a p it al c ity which is well - k n ow n world w id e
The p ri est is a direct de s c en d ant of the the world old est d y n as ty , and he is also the only e m p er or now ex is t s in the who le world
There are three ho l ly d ur able s called " The T h re e S a c r ed T re as ur es
T h o se are own ed by the e m p er or and have been s u c ce ed from g en er ation to g en er ation
E a ch of them is g u ar d ed close ly at the an c i ent s an c t u ar ies and they are regard ed un t o u ch able
The g i g ant ic c ity it s el f has also been close ly pro te c ted by la y er ed ma g ic s by an sub l im e w i z ar d since it was est a b l ish ed
So it is an ar t if ic i al ma g ic - d e f en s ed c ity
It is un p re c ed ent ed s c al e and any other such c ity is no long er ex is t , even in the the c r ad le of the ma g ic
I ha te sea she p ar d
I feel like they are do ing such things just for f un
F ir st thing I want to insist is there is no di f f er ence between w ha le and co w
B i o l o g ical y they are both class if i ed as m um al
D o you think it can be as a reason to not k i ll it
We have the c ul ture to a p p l ic i ate all live s e qu ally
A p ri l 1 st is the day which called A p ri l F o o l s ' D a y
But I am not going to be fool in this j o ur n al
A p ri l is the big in n ing of school sea s on
I gradua ted N a g o y a U n ive r s ity and got the de g re e of Bachelor of E ng in e er ing last month
No w I ' m going gradua te school of N a g o y a U n ive r s ity
I le ar n ed many things d ur ing last year
They were not only sp e c i al know led g es
My a im of this year is " le ar n a l ot and play a l ot " by e f f ic i ent time man age ment
I ' m f in ally over with mi d ter m s
F in ally the mi d - ter m s are done now
But not for this year
This year , it mean s , f in ally I can f o c us on my re se ar ch
My re se ar ch is about the op t im i z ation of the ma in ten ance str ate g y of e le c t r ical e qu i p ment s
I have no idea how to so l ve this yet
I have only 5 month to finish this
So I have no time to re po se
I have n ' t to u ch ed my e le c t r ical di ction ar y the se days
This mean s I have n ' t us ed English the se days
L e ar n ing English is not a v o id able for my future
I have to sp en d more time with English
It had been re ally co l d unti l last week
In the me d d le of A p ri l , It ' s usual ly w ar m enough to go out with we ar ing only a long - s le e v ed shirt or some time s c as u al j a c ke t on it in here
But the day of last week , it was so co l d that I need ed to we ar a down j a c ke t even it ' s already sp r ing
To day , the p rofessor of the en er g y tra s n s f or m ing e ng in e er ing class to ul d us some do u b t of g l o b al w ar m ing
He de s c ri b ed it from the view po in t s of the number of the s un s po t s , the a x is of the e ar th and the e ar th ' s year ly round
He said that the e ar th is f a c ing the g l o b al co o ling now
He said it will cause a serious co o l s um m er all over the world
The we ther for e c a st said tomorrow go n n a be co l d
I just can ' t wait the n ic e w ar m sp r ing
We took part in it as the Y F U which is the ex change or g an i z ation that took care of me while I was stay ing in A m er ic a
I had been told that we were suppose d to explain the act i v it ies of the Y F U to students who were interest ed in study ing a b ro ad
We have he l d such a meeting last month
So we suppose d that this was b ound to go easily
But it was n ' t
A c t u ally this even t was a kind of ex t r a c ur ri c ul ar act i v it ies
There were a l ot of other or g an i z ation s such as the gr o up of J a p an e se dr um play er s , the we l f ar e work er s and the ri v al or g an i z ation who se name is A F S
But all of them were most ly for people who want to study a b ro ad
So the con t ent s of s l id e show which we p re p ar ed were most ly about how to a p p ly the Y F U ex change pro g r a m , the history of the Y F U and the str u c ture of the or g an i z ation
So it was a serious ty pe thing and was n ' t a f un thing at all
The ri v al or g an i z ation , A F S , was do ing re ally f un thing
We to t ally mi st ook the p ur p or t of the even t
We were feel ing like ly ing on the be d of th or n s
L a st S at ur day , we hold a C h ri st m as P ar ty for ex change students
There are n in e ex ch age students stay ing in this To k a i are a through Y F U
Y F U is the one of the world ' s large st ex change or g an i z ation
I ' ve been stay ing in A m er ic a for a year as a ex change st ud ent 3 year s a g o through Y F U
I re ally a p p re c i ate to The m
So , to re p la y and express my feel ing of gra t it ud e , I ' m work ing for Y F U as a volunteer now
The se ex change students are return ing to their home l and at the begin n ing of next month
So we want ed them to have one more another p re c i ous me m or y of J a p an
This was why we he l d the ch ri st m as part y
A bout the place for part y ha ll , a gentle man who also has the ex change ex pe ri ence through Y F U run s a c a f e at mi d t ow n N a g o y a and he let us to us e it for the P ar ty
That is re ally n ic e place
It con s is t s of n ic e in ter i or s and co o l draw ing s are pai n ted all over the wall s

On the very day of the C h ri st m as P ar ty , it was l o v ly , o ver 3 0 people came
There were for e i g n ex change students , th e ir friend s and re st of them were be l on g to from my age to old er even over 5 0
We ent er tain ed them for many s n a c k s , j u ic es and J a p an e se tra d i tion al f o o d T e m a k i - S us h i

It is re ally p un g ent
A fter game , w e enjoy ed cha t ting with each other and the ha ll kept ra ng ing with the sound of laugh ter
One of the ex change students had a b ir th day just on that day
So we ce le b r ate her 1 7 th b ir th day with so - c ut e b ir th day c a ke
I ho pe we could make un f or g e t t able me m or y for them
I wish , f in ally , I want to pay every on e who help ed to me ke such success ful P ar ty my be st compli ment
I p ar k ed on the street around the un ive r s ity
And where I p ar k ed was only 2 me ter s away from the cross ro ad
I have to pay the p en al ty of it . ? ? ( ? ? ` ? ) ? ?
The fine of i ll i g al p ar k ing is ? 1 8 0 0 0
This is so ex p en s ive
But I have to accept that , other w is e I will get ar re st ed
O h man , If I did n ' t co m m it , I could bu y an another mo n it or and a gra p h ic board
O h , and just in case , I will up l o ad the picture of the are a that you are not all ow ed to p ar k
B e care ful when you p ar k your c ar on the ro ad

And do c t or said he has the me ta st as is sp re ad of can c er of all around his body
D o c t or also said his days are number ed , 3 month at most
I ' m re ally pro ud of him
He has been help ing my life
When I ho p ed to study a b ro ad in A m er ic a , he was the one who a p p ro v ed and pai d who le ex p en se s
He also pai d my t u i tion fee s , and what ' s more he is s aving to p re p ar e for my gradua te school fee s
When I get back from 1 y e ar study ing a b ro ad , I visit ed my gr and p ar ent s first
He looked at me at one ce , and s ud d en ly he st or m ed about my ha ir co l or
C an you y e ll to your gr and s on you see after an in ter v al of a year
He could n ' t over l ook that I seemed like I change d the id ent ity and los t my p ri d e in be e ing J a p an e se
So ne e x t day , I had my ha ir c ut re ally short , and co l or ed my ha ir black
Then I visit them again and apologize d
B e c a us e I think it is J a p an e se id ent ity
He brought up me
I had never face d such sit u ation , some on e who is re ally close to me is d y ing before
A t first , I kind a los t my gra s p of what I was f a c ing
