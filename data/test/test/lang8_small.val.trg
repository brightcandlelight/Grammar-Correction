I would a p p re c i ate it if you could c or re c t my sen t ence s
It ' s been get ting co l d er l ate ly here in J a p an . ( " The se days " is a p h r a se I of ten he ar J a p an e se and K or e an n at ive speak er s us e in their English , al th ough in n at ive English speak er s would probab ly say " l ate ly " or " re c ent ly " . It ' s so r t of the e qu i v al ent of ? ?
I find J a p an ' s s um m er we a ther dis a g re e able because of it s high hu m id ity and te m p er a ture
So , as the w in ter is coming , I ' m start ing to feel better
It is a very ex c it ing sea s on
But , before enjoy ing those kind of ha p p y time s , I have to do a kind of b or ing ,
I have a f i ance e and she is find ing a job . ( if she does n ' t have a job yet us e " a " job , but if she has a job then us e " h er " job
It does n ' t see m easy for w ome n to find job s in J a p an
The first , most w ome n have b a b ies and they have to take ma ter n ity leave
E m p l o y er s don ' t like it even if ma ter n ity leave is the right of e m p l o y e es
The second , w ome n work er s like ly to qu it their job because of ch il d care or the transfer of the r hu s b and s
If a woman work er qu it s her job , e m p l o y er s have to find a new e m p l o y e e
T h ough there are many w ome n work er s who have ex ce ll ent p ot ent i al , e m p l o y er s of ten he s it ate to hi re them
It is the first time
When I first ar ri v ed in B ri s b an e , it was always s un n y
I am mi s s ing the w ar m we a ther
It ' s too hard for me
My go al is an over a ll 7 . 0 , but it may need to more than 1 year
English is the hard er , the more difficult language
I re ally ho pe that I will be able to speak English like a n at ive
I also have another pro ble m
I always p r a c t ic e pro no un c i ation , but it ' s get ting more difficult
I don t know why I can ' t re c o g n i z e " e a " " i " , s u ch as , " ch e a p as ch i p s
If I said that sen t ence , people will he ar the same pro no un c i ation
2 month s la ter , I am going to back to K or e a
I just le ar n ed the al p ha b e t
It is said that because the K or e an gra m m ar is similar to the J a p an e se s , so that the K or e an who study J a p an e se take about 1 year to speak J a p an e se f l u ent ly , while the other for e i g n er s have to take 3 or 4 year s or more
I found that the K or e an al p ha b e t is e as i er to write than the J a p an e se s
How about the way to sp e ll
And after I entered the J a p an e se de p ar t ment , I even can t re c a ll any English gra m m ar that I le ar n ed before
But it s also said that it s very difficult to le ar n both of them well
One time , I had a J a p an e se ex a m in ation
The J a p an e se who see a k at a k an a w or d just sp e ll it normal ly but we who had le ar n t English before see a k at a k an a w or d , we just try to think of an English w or d and then sp e ll it
I like English very much but I ch o se the J a p an e se de p ar t ment for no reason
Then I asked my brother for a d v ic e , he said that I like J a p an e se
I was a c qu a in ted with him in a C h in e se cha t room when I was at 9 th gra d e about 4 year s a g o
He is a very sp e c i al person , even though we ve me t in re al life yet
He is 8 year s old er than me but he is just a friend
He is very hu m or ous and hand s ome
He can always make me smile even when I m in a bad mo o d
But in my un ive r s ity , at the second year of re g ul ar train ing , we can ch o o se a second qu al if ic ation if we want and be able to study both well
My un ive r s ity has about 1 1 for e i g n language de p ar t ment s and some other de p ar t ment where they tea ch e c on o m ic s , tra ve l business , comp ut er s , and so on . . . If we re le ar n ing a for e i g n language , we re a d v is ed to ch o o se the e c on o m ic s or tra ve l bu s s i ness de p ar t ment so that when we gradua te we will have the be st job
So next year , I in ten d to ch o o se the English de p ar t ment for the second qu al if ic ation
When we re at the th ir d year , we have a comp ul s or y sub j e c t
It s different from the second qu al if ic ation
B e c a us e the second qu al if ic ation also has e c on o m ic s , tra ve l business , comp ut er s . . . train ing and it is n t comp ul s or y
F or ex amp le , I m le ar n ing J a p an e se , I have to ch o o se one of the 1 0 other for e i g n language s
So , if next year I ch o o se the English de p ar t ment , the year after I may ch o o se K or e an for second for e i g n language
To le ar n almost f l u ent J a p an e se , we have 4 year s
A fter that , I am not sure that we can be able to speak it f l u ent ly
It s called th e l o ve language , is n t it
D o you know our U n c le H o was able to speak f l u ent ly more than 1 0 for e i g n language s
I can t do it like that but I wish I could le ar n at least 4 : J a p an e se , English , K or e an and F re n ch
D o I have the ability to do it
I m very w or ri ed about it
This time we still have to t est 4 J a p an e se s k i ll s
I m very n er v ous of speak ing and listen ing s k i ll s
It was so bad , was n t it ? The es s a y to p ic this time will be r and o m
I ll have to write anything in J a p an e se as the to p ic request s
L if e is short
to try hard
We w or e w ed d ing dress es de s p ite the a b s ence of our b ri d e g ro o m s
W ish I sen d my be st wish es for to her . . I know this might sound str a ing e , but this is a very co m m on us age in English - to sen d some on e good wish es on a b ir th day or other o c c as ion
That is T h o se are my mother s picture s , which were take n when she was you ng er . You ng is also c or re c t , but the w or d you ng er is more polite , as it does n ' t im p ly she is so old now
I s n ' t she beautiful
My comp ut er s C D R O M was b ro k en so I can t in st a ll J a p an e se f on t
I ll try to con t in u e this di ar y one near day next day
There is a big di f f er ence between the e a st and the we st , when come s to education . I always a d m ir ed how the we s ter n er s ed u c ate their po s ter ity , their me th o d is so gentle and kind , full of l o ve and mean ing , where as the As i an me th o d is rather more of v i o l ence more v i o l ent , for ex amp le the C h in e se people believe that a ch il d should be ed u c at ed with ro d s
C o un t less be at ing s from their p ar ent is believe d to be c a p able of for g ing a success ful ch il d ! That ' s how I was brought up at least . My p ar ent always tell me how much they l o ve me , al th ough they serve d me with ro d every time I co m m it ted a wrong do ing . However , when come s to the we s ter n way of p ar ent ing , it sound s like a f a ir y ta le to me . F or ex amp le , the we s ter n p ar ent s always said this to their ch il d if they happen ed to be re p ud i ate , the p ar ent will say this " g o to your room ! " This is something that will never happen in an As i an family
M a y b e our p ar ent s would never re al i z e the tra um a they had in f l ic ted on us !"
How success ful was the L e a gue of N ation s in est a b l ish ing pe a ce d ur ing the 1 9 2 0 s
The L e a gue of N ation s was an or g an i z ation for m ed to im p ro ve the live s and work ing condition s of the people around the world , to work for pe a ce through dis ar m a ment and to up h o l d and en f or ce the T re at y of V er s a il le s
The L e a gue was success ful in est a b l ish ing pe a ce d ur ing the 1 9 2 0 s by dis c o ur a g ing a g g re s s ion to w ar d s other co un t ri es through ne g ot i ation . The L e a gue also p l an n ed to provide co ll e c t ive se c ur ity through a co m m un ity of p ow er , for ex amp le in the case of S il es i a , where the L e a gue settled a dis p ut e between G er man y and P o l and through a p le b is c ite . A no ther ex amp le is the A al and I s l and s , where after an in ve st i g ation the L e a gue man age d to set t le a dis p ut e between S w ed en and F in l and . The L e a gue was also success ful in im p ro v ing living stand ar d s . F or ex amp le they provide d direct a id and we l f ar e to the people in need around the world . One of their f a m ous act s is the re p at ri ation of 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 W W I p ri s on er s , who m they e m p l o y ed them to k i ll mo s qu it o s to p re v ent ma la ri a and also to p re v ent le p ro s y . They also provide d e c on o m ic ex p er t s to help A ust ri a and H un g ar y , as well as est a b l ish ing the In ter n ation al L a b o ur O r g an i z ation
As T h re e of the most p ow er ful n ation s in the world did not part ic i p ate in the L e a gue of N ation s : they are G er man y
R us s i a and the United States . The two most p ow er ful co un t ri es in the L e a gue , B ri tain and F r ance , want ed to re c o ver from their e c on o m ic los s in W W I so they show ed no ent h us i as m to get in v o l v ed . The L e a gue f a il ed to est a b l ish dis ar m a ment , first in 1 9 2 3 and then in 1 93 1 , both time s because of B ri tain and G er man y ' s un w il ling ness to co op er ate . However they did ar r an g e a con f er ence in 1 9 2 8 where the K e ll o g - B ri and P a c t , which was an act of the L e a gue ' s as se m b ly out la w ing w ar , was sign ed by 2 3 n ation s and s up p or ted by 6 5 co un t ri es and which out la w ed w ar
However the L e a gue was un s u c ce s s ful because it large ly f a il ed to a ch i e ve most of their dis ar m a ment were not a ch i e ve
The great est a ch i e ve ment of the L e a gue was it s work on so c i al is s u es . No or g an i z ation had ever ta c k led the se pro ble m s before ; unti l now their c amp a i g n has been take n over by the U
N so it is a great success . However it f a il ed to stop p ow er ful co un t ri es start ing a w ar , f a il ed to est a b l ish dis ar m a ment and also f a il ed to de f en d / up h o l d the T re at y of V er s a il le s .
