And his innermost thoughts are living in me
Of course I wasn't going to cry
I was going there relieve him
When I saw him and his gaunt face, I couldn't check the flow of tears
I've realized what I am facing, he is passing away
I couldn't tell him what I was going to say well because the tears kept interefering
And also I realized I can not possibly put my gratitude into words
I vowed to work as much as I could and contribute to the world to his face
Beyond that, I could only tell him \" Thank you for everything, everything you have given me.\" And I left his house with saying \" See you later
If I were to die tomorrow, I would feel that I haven't yet shared enough of what my grandpa has given to me. couldn't put what he had gave to me to account enough
So I decided to try to take more oppotunities to tell my friends, my juniors and you who is reading my diary, what I learned until now
And I'll try harder to leave more things in this world
I represent my honorable grandpa
I should never disgrace his honour
Today I had my third time of the English conversation class
日に一画足して9個漢字を作るという問題がとけません。
First we were given a piece of paper which is written the article (where an article was printed) but some sentences are blanked (were left blank
Then the teacher read the article to us, and we filled in the blanks. [ I had never thought about \"filled in\" and \"filled out\" before. That's the beauty (one of the beauties) of Lang-8. You see your native language in a new light! The two phrases are almost alike. I would use \"fill in\" when completing a puzzle, and \"fill out\" for a job application or for a new doctor's file, information about yourself. ] 
And we filled out (in) the blanks
雨の日も、風の日も、靴の紐。[Japanese-style pun]. I think it is punny
Oh, there is a home work (homework) due next week
Then it hit me.\" [ \"Then it hit me\" is an expression that means \"I quickly realized.\" The pun here is that both the ball and the realization that the ball looked bigger because it was coming at you so fast (the nearer the ball comes, the closer you are to getting hit with it) both \"hit you\" at once -- the ball physically hit you and the realization mentally hit you. Here's another example: \"I wondered where I had left my umbrella. I searched the house. No luck. Then \"it hit me\" (I quickly, suddenly realized) I'd left it under my car seat.\" OR, \"I was daydreaming yesterday when suddenly a great idea hit me.\" (It came to me as fast as lightning.) 
直訳：「球が近づいていたら、頭が打かられた。」\"hit me\"は「気が付く」も「ぶつかれた」もと言う意味です。
My favorite one is, \"There was a sign on the lawn at a (the) drug re-hab center that said 'Keep off the Grass
Today I went to the Atsuta shrine and the Shiratori Japanese-style garden
A Shinto shrine is a structure which is made built as the house of kami-sama
It's placed in a It's only an hour from my house but I had never been there before
I love your photos!!! 
t I felt like \"the true colors of Japan\" was were there
Can I walk on this bridge
There Here are some rules about paying homage at a shrine
2 You have to must walk on the left side of the road because its center is for only the kami-sama to walk. may walk in the center
Then tap your hands twice , bow and make a wish with your desire in your heart
At this point, After you make your wish, you shouldn't speak your wish in voice. say it outloud
These are some of the conventions of Shinto
But I saw many people who didn't follow them
Japanese-style gardens are often made in imitation of the real scenery
And this is the biggest Japanese-style garden in Nagoya which that imitated the scenery of this area
It has a quaint atmosphere
I think leaves of the trees will be really beautiful when they will turn in autumn and it must be really beautiful
It's been 2 days since I met you, my brain is full of you
Because if I touch you I think everything I've established is gonna collapse
That fear could alienate you
If I had got on you in my birthday suit, 
being held by you until the moon set over the sea, and shared the panorama of the color of the sky
I would've not be feeling this gloom
Oh) How many times will I have more sleepless nights will I have
I cannot concentrate on anything else; but I'm just so in love with you
my dear new bed."
I'm not in a good shape
This morning I woke up with a horrible stomachache
So I ran into the bathroom as soon as I left the bed. 他の言い方： So I rushed into the bathroom the moment I left my bed\/woke up. (This is slightly more natural but your sentence is okay too
I didn't feel good since last Saturday
This happens periodically\/occasionally
It's like, only the air is being thin only around me becomes very thin
I can't center my focus\/concentrate on my studying\/revision
I made a promise to myself! 
On the day of my birthday, I decided to never fail to write a journal entry everyday
This was way I was in a hurry last night
It is the biggest priority for me to keep my promises
But I will keep it up
I will try to persevere through!!! (Using \"undaunted\" is a little weird here
Now it's 12:30 in Japan now
Or, \"I don't know what else I can say
It might be the best movie I've ever watched. [or \"ever seen
I have watched many movies. [or \"have seen
But I had never watched such a movie before. [seen
So I don't know how to comment on it
Actually, Radiohead’s Last Flowers is used as an ending song for the film
I've heard the news that Hollywood is remaking it with Daniel Radcliffe and Nicole Kidman
I'm sure it will fail
Because I'm sure that it is impossible to make this movie except in Japanese\/in Japan\/for a Japanese audience
What I'm trying to say is, even if you are a great chef, you can't make a Japanese dish with American seasoning
Ah, I can't quite express my feelings
There is only one thing that I am sure of
It is that I am glad that I could watch this movie
After we had lunch at 矢場とん, we went to the Nagoya Castle!　(You don't need 'the' since Nagoya is considered the name of the castle.) 
Perhaps I had been there before, but I didn't remember anything of it
They looked realistic. (They looked like the real thing
Then we moved to 栄 and went to the restaurant which serves a cake buffet
They served more than 15 kinds of cakes and we could eat as many as we wanted! (I think in all cases, instead of 'serve\/served', I would use 'have\/had' instead. Serving implies that it is handed over to you in person. And usually that's not the case with a buffet. 
They served cream puffs, custard puddings, short cakes, and many other cakes which I had never seen before
The clerks ,customers and everyone in the house sang birthday song toghether
We had plenty of cakes and a great time
Then we took 名無しさん and Porschla to the bus station and they departed for Takayama
They had a free day in Nagoya because the flight reserved would departure this afternoon

How to Make Friends Titles are capitalized. 
When I was young, I found it very easy to make a new friend
However, it's more and more hard now
Why?, I think it is because of the lack of trust
When we are little, we even don't know what is right and what is wrong
