I will appreciate it if you correct my sentences
It's been getting colder these days here in Japan
The summer weather in Japan is not agreeable to me with its high humidity and temperature
So, as the winter is coming, I'm getting to feel better
It is the very exciting season
But, before enjoying those kind of happy time, I have to do a kind of boring, 
I have a fiancee and she is finding her job
It seems not easy to find a job for women in Japan
The first, most women have baby and they have to take maternity leave
Employers don't like it even if maternity leave is the right for employees
The second,  women workers likely to quit their job because of child care or the transfar of ther husbands
If a woman worker quit her job, employers have to find a new employee
Though there are many women workers who have excellent potentil, employers often hesitate to hire them
It was first time
When I was arrived in Brisbane, it was always sunny
I am missing warm weather
Its too hard for me
My goal is an overall 7.0, but it may need to more than 1 year
English is the harder , the more difficult
I really hope that I speak English seems to native
Also, I have another problem
I always practice pronounce, but getting more difficult
I dont know why I cant recognize \"ea\" \"i\" ,such as, \"cheap as chips
If I said that sentence, people will be heard same pronounciation
2 months later, I am going to back to Korea
I just learnt alphabet
It’s said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japanese’s, so that the Korean who study Japanese just have to take about 1year to speak Japanese fluently, while the other foreigners have to take 3,4 years or more than so 
I found that the Korean’s alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese’s
How about the way of spell
And after I entered the Japanese department, I even can’t recall any English’s grammars that I’d learnt before
But it’s also said that it’s very difficult to learn well both of them
One time, I had an Japanese examination
The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before when see a katakana word, we just try to think of an English word and then spell it
I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reasons
Then I asked my brother for an advice, he said that “I like Japanese
I was acquainted with him in a Chinese’s room chat when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago
He is very special person, even though we’ve met in real life yet
He is 8 years older than me but he just likes a friend
He is very humorious and handsome 
He can always make me smile even when I’m in bad mood
But in my university, at the second year of regular training, we can choose a second qualifications if we want and sure that we’ll be able to study well both
My university has about 11 foreign language’s departments and some other department where teach economics, travel bussiness, computer and so on… If we’re learning a foreign language, we’re advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness’s department so that when we graduate we will have a best job
So next year, I intend to choose English department for the second qualifications
And when we’re at the third year, we have a compulsory subject
It’s differ from the second qualifications
Because the second qualifications  also has economics, travel bussiness, computer… training and it isn’t compulsory
For example, I’m learning Japanese, I have to choose one in 10 other foreign languages remained
So, if next year I choose the English department, the year after I maybe choose Korean for second foreign language
To learn almost Japanese, we have 4 years
After that, it’s not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently
It’s called “love’s language”, isn’t it
Do you know our Uncle Ho who was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages
I can’t do like that but I wish I could learn at least 4: Japanese, English, Korean and French
Do I have the ability to do
I’m very worry about it
This time  we still have to test 4 Japanese’s skill
I’m very nervous of speaking and listening skill
It was so bad, wasn’t it?And the essay’s topic this time will be random
I’ll have to write anything in Japanese as topic’s request
And life is short
This is try hard
We wore wedding dress despite the absence of our bridegrooms
Wish best wishes for her
That is my mother’s pictures which were taken when she was young

There is a big difference between the east and the west, when comes to education,i always admired how the westerner educate their posterity,their method is so gentle and kind,full of love and meaning,whereas the asian method is rather more of violence,for example the chinese people believe that a child should be educated with rods
countless beating from their parent is believe to be capable of forging a successful child!thats how i was brought up at least, my parent always tell me how much they love me although they served me with rod every time i commit a wrongdoing,however when comes to the western way of parenting,it sounds like a fairy tale to me,for example the western parent always said this to their child if they happened to be repudiate, the parent will say this\" go to your room!\" this is something that will never happen in an asian family
May be our parent would never realize the trauma they had inflicted on us
how successful was the league of nations in establishing peace during the 1920s
The league of nations is an organization form to improve lives and jobs of the people around the world,settle peace by disarmament ,and to uphold and enforce the treaty of Versailles
The league was successful in establishing peace during 1920s through discouraging aggression to other countries by negotiation ,the Lon also plan to provide collective security by a community of power,example silesia,where the league settle a dispute between germany and poland through plebiscite,another example is the aaland where under lon's investigation settle a dispute between sweden and finland,the league is also successful in improving the life of people,for example they provide direct aid and welfare to the people in need around the world,one of the famous act is the repatriation of 400000 ww1 prisoners and employ them to kill mosquitos to prevent malaria and also prevent leprosy,they also provide economic experts to help Austria and Hungary as well as establishing the international labour organization
As three of the most powerful nations in the world do not participate in the lon they are germany
russia and united state,the two most powerful countries in lon britain and france wanted to recover their economic loss in ww1 so they show no enthusiastic to get involve,the league fail to establish disarmament,first in 1923 and second in 1931 both fail because britain and germany,however they did arrange a conference in 1928 the kellog-briand pact which was an act of league assembly sign by 23 nations and supported by 65 countries and which outlawed war
however they are unsuccessful because most of their disarmament  were not achieve
the greatest achievement of the league is the social issue no organization had ever do it before ,until now their war has been taken over by the U
N so it is a great success,however it fail to stop powerful countries starting a war,fail to establish disarmament,also fail to defend the treaty of Versailles ,these give rise to aggression by axis power
Now It's snowing in Tokyo 
When I was a child, I liked snowing

Qin urged Paris to stop interfering in China's internal affairs,and immediately correct its wrongdoing
This move by the Paris government gravely damaged the city's image among the Chinese, Qin said
A poll on the website of the Global Times found more than 87 percent of voters firmly opposed the Paris move
Paris should bear all the blame, Qin said, urging Paris to takethe right attitude towards the Chinese people's voice, and stop its offence to the Chinese people, in a bid to create an essentialcondition for the cooperation with Chinese cities

I rode from the bike shop to home on it right after I purchased
It was 30 minutes ride
It was great to ride roadway
There weren't any bumpy things, so I could go really fast
But I often had to stop and turn my face back because there were so many taxis cars parking on the streets
My bike doesn't have a stand, so I lifted it up and brought it in front of my apartment which is on the 3rd floor
The frame is aluminum made, so it is light as a feather

I bought a sleeping bag
From now on, I can stay up all night in the lab comfortably
No more arranged chairs
The love and the Japanese language
Japanese, however, hadn't have the proper word which signifies \"love\" because of the sensibilities and lyricism
When one of his students put \"I love you\" into Japanese as ”私はあなたを愛しています\", he warned him against that translation
Japanese should put it into like  \"今夜は月が綺麗ですね\"(which means \"The moon looks more beautiful tonight\") instead
I think what he meant was that \"love\" is the feeling that makes the moon looks brighter than the moon you see by yourself
Previously of my last journal entries

Nonetheless I felt shakiness in my house
I pray for that damages won't extend any more
I experienced so many things which were beyond possibility in Japan
And now she is a freshmen of Luther College
I had never ridden a bullet train for a while
So I was worried about if I could see her
Today was the first day of this school year of the lab I belong
This is the Website of the lab
The regions of research of this laboratory are Electric Power Equipment and High Electric Field phnemenon
I'm in my 4th year of Nagoya University now
I'm inexperienced and my competence for reseaching is not enough
So I am going to knock myself out to learn as many as possible from great professors and seniors
My dream is to be a professor of the reagion of Electric Power Equipment and Asset management
To realize my dream, I must do my possible
I hope everyone had a great day of Christmas
The name of band is \"celandaine
He is a lead vocalist of the band
And he also write songs for the band
They have been awarded the first prize of a band competition which was all teenage bands in Japan could enter
So I am not sure if that name means properly
Today I went to the YFU meeting for the long-term staying overseas students
They arrived here 2 month ago
And they are leaving this winter
He could write the kanji of \"鬱
We talked about why they decided to come to Japan and what they like of Japan
Most said that they really love the food of Japan
Fortunately, the exhibition of the Japanese art was held on the same floor of where we were having the meeting
And it was for free to admit
So I took everyone into the exhibition
So if you blow it, it will be destroyed
And he took the pictures of us for free
And then they treated us to matcha and cha-gashi by courtesy of them
It was the really good experience
And I really appreciate their many kindness to us
I cought a cold
I got a cold
So I take a day off to write a journal entry
Good night everyone
I'm going to bed
I don't like rainy season
Many individuals believe that nuclear power plants are considerable danger
The Chernobyl disaster left unforgettable damages due to the explosion of the plant and release of the radiation
Many countries, however, decided to reconsider of nuclear power plant development
So I wrote few lines along the textbook
It was really hard to write as Academic writing
But if I keep writing like this, I think I will get good score at the TOEFL test
Don't you think so
The weather forecast said the rain will go on for this week
I think it's a little bit early to set in the rainy season
I'm thinking to mange my daily schedules in English
I'm thinking to manage my daily schedules in English
So would you tell me how people usually write them on their notebooks
9:00～12:00 Group Discussiong of Hanai group at IB Room 101

How' do you think
I bettered my own record of  TOEIC
The day before yesterday, the result of the 153th TOEIC test was announced on the internet
The score of the TOEIC will be converted into the score of the English
And 905 points will be converted to 100 out of 100
What I meant is I am finally ready to concentrate upon the entrance examination of the graduate school 
We hold a 2 day orientation oft YFU exchange student program
I met some former friends at high school
We talked about our senses of value
And we talked about our future career
My grandpa finally passed away
I am going to see the cherry blossams with my lab members and professors
I was transfered to the 3rd grade of Nagoya University from Toyota National College of Technology last year
So last year I experienced my first campas life
At the bigginning of the school year, I had almost no friend in the university
But now I am aurrounded by many friends, senors and juniors
I recieved so many greetings yesterday
From friends, familiy, friends in US, host family and so on
Those mede me realized I had been supported by so many people
And those gave me plenty of push
I am going to set about the math section of the entrance examination for graduate school tomorrow
It's been 2 month since my last journal
Time flies very fast
I've been through so many stimulative experiences these days
But this margin is too small to contain
Fermat's phrase
I've been sticking on my graduation research, staying overnight in the lab twice a week
But finally I'm realizing the fun of research
Going to a Amusement park with exchange students
I had to do so many tough stuffs like having a presentation in front of all of the lab members and professors
But they never remain in my brain
I feel like I just content myself with reading English, but I learned nothing
I guess I need to put more stress on English
The centerpiece of the rides is the roller coaster called \"Steel Dragon
It was on the Guinness Book as the world's tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster
Some of them were broken
I am not good at  scream machines
But one of them who is from Michigan really likes those kind of things
So I was dragged to them
I chickened right in front of its platform once
I had been having a prejudice for a long time
It was way much funner than I thought
It's been a while since last time I wrote my journal
Sorry about I haven't been able to give you any help for a month
But I'm done with all exams
This means beginning of 2 months of spring break
I'm trying to write a jounal at least once in a 3 days
And I'll try to give you what help I can
By the way, I found beautiful lines written by Miyazawa Kenji
But I don't know how to put it into English
Flowers raining in the sky, we call them star
Stars shines on the earth, we call them flower
Something like this
What Japanese government said and what foreign press said differed in many accounts
Maybe Japanese government has been trying to control information to avoid panic
But this backfired
Many people are disarrayed
Tokyo Electric Power Company was one of the most secured large companies
But that day, it fell off
Nothing is certain
In addition to the my last journal, my birthday is placed at the end the season of that cherry trees are in full blossom
I went out to the park with my friends to enjoy a picnic under the cherry blossoms on my birthday
The park was congested  with many people
So it was not like enjoying the tasteful gardens
But people were having fun with beer bottles in their hands and the foods of stalls
As the time rolls on, people are losing their hearts to love the nature
But they still have hearts to love and enjoy having fun with friends
this is not what I was going to write
So see you then
【PR】My best friend's band is releasing the major debut album on 4\/21
He is a one of my best friends
We went to the same school and had been in a same class for five years
I've written a journal about him and his band a while ago
At that time, I asked you for some help for the name of the major debut album in behalf of him
He hopse his songs will be your fire and warm your heart
Enjoying our lives is important thing
But while we live in each nations, there are responsibilities and obligations
I really reflect on myself about this
The subject was \"Is it possible that each of the people all over the world uses the same amount of energy that a Japanese uses now
At no distant date, the time may come when people will have used up all the oil
But if the blade is damaged by lightning and need replacement, the wind must be slight enough to undertake the construction work safely
This means that operating a wind power generator requires constant and powerful wind but it must stop periodically
So I think I should go to bed a bit than earlier tonight
I will write more about the energy problem sometime not distant date
I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning
So I had to finish it tonight and leave him to turn it tomorrow morning
I haven't had dinner yet
Sorry about I've been unable to correct your journals these days.(´；ω；｀
So correcting your journal entries from that computer is really hard to do.(´・ω・
So I'm thinking to bring the laptop computer which I usually use at home to the lab, and leave it for some time
Furthermore, my graduation research could be a kind of simulation stuff, I think
Don't you think so
But I decided to do it to save my money
But it's gonna be much more powerful than ones made by manufacturers
I'm thinking to use some wire shelfs which I've kept outside
They are covered with rust so bad
I have the BBQ and hiking this weekend
I guess this gonna take a while
I didn't have a refrigerator
So I used to take meals at school cafeteria or just buy some convenience food
And by gigantic city, I mean it's Tokyo
Feng-Sui derives from Chinese long time ago
But It had been used  in Japan since medieval times for a long time
And the queer monk, 天海, rearranged whole city of Edo under the Feng-Shui's doctrine
To make a long story short, he changed the names of places around the castle
He also placed many temples and Japanese style garden under the Feng-Sui
Many of Japanese are not aware of it
I was at the \"Tacos Paty\" last night
All participants works for YFU as a volunteer
The second picture is of the hadmade tiramisu
One of them had the birthday recently
It was tacos party but also her birthday party
It's been a week since last time I wrote a jounal
Last Thursday, I was present at the party
That party was aimed for learnig English conversation
This kind of parties are held periodically
But this was my first time to take part in
And I waited them about 30 minutes under the cold wether
We could drink as much drinks as we want
I drunk litters of Gin Tonic
We only had English conversations
But also it was fun to talk with Japanese who are interested in English
I forgot about that this was my firtst time and enjoyed speaking English
Those pictures were taken at there
I am the guy who is accidentally kissing with 42 old guy in the second picture.) 
Around 22:30, people started leaving if not they were missing the last trains
Then wemoved to next place
We walked about 10 or 20 minutes with a straggeringly
We talked about many funny things (mostly indecent things) at there
We stayed at there until morning
I have TOEIC test in a months
I didn't  write a jounal enry last night.ｐ(≧ヘ≦。)ｑ
But the computer which is provided for me by the lab was really slow
I tried to uninstall some applications and did a virus check
It took couple hours
Then workshop started
When I got to home, it was past 10 p.m. (＞、＜
I still could wirte a jounal but I was too exhasted
I need to be more steadily
And sleeps only a hour
He says his bed is too comfortable
He might sleep more than a hour if he sleeps in the bed
I don't know if a hour is enough for me
I feel proud of Japan
I also feel sad for the losses of those culture
The Golden Week starts tomorrow
There are many different theories regarding what motivetes human being to act in the ways in the what they do
I agree with the latter position because all human activities have something to do with society which embrace the other people
Ultimately any kind of human actions are mold by affection to others
And I'm in the middle of the section about \"Introduction.\" hehe
Now I'm wring a paper about the currents state and futere prospects of the energy suppry in Japan
I'm examining the renewable energy and the nuclear power
The more I learn, the more obvious that the development of the nuclear power plant is reasonable
I don't think I could write what I intended properly
But, \"Haste makes wastes!\",\"Stay calm!\" and \"Be cool
Most of people say Eminem is one of the coarsest rappers in history of music because of his behavior, words and his songs which are studded with insults
He has put affronts upon many celebrities in his songs such as Michel Jacson, Elvis Presley and even his ex-wife
A song which is in his 3rd album, however, shows those of his insults might be not his real intention
This song which you might heve not heard of is named \"Hailie's Song
Hailie\" is his daughter's name
Please turn off or put your cellphone into silent mode while the show
the \"Hailie's song
There is a huge forest which no one can trespass on its holy ground in the middle of the capital city which is well-known worldwide
The priest is a direct descendant of the the world oldest dynasty, and he is also the only emperor now exists in the whole world
There are three holly durables called \"The Three Sacred Treasures
Those are owned by the emperor and have been succeed from generation to generation
Each of them is guarded closely at the ancient sanctuaries and they are regarded untouchable
The gigantic city itself has also been closely protected by layered magics by an sublime wizard since it was established
So it is an artificial magic-defensed city
It is unprecedented scale and any other such city is no longer exist, even in the the cradle of the magic
I hate sea shepard
I feel like they are doing such things just for fun
First thing I want to insist is there is no difference between whale and cow
Biologicaly they are both classified as mumal
Do you think it can be as a reason to not kill it
We have the culture to appliciate all lives equally
April 1st is the day which called April Fools' Day
But I am not going to be fool in this journal
April is the biginning of school season
I graduated Nagoya University and got the degree of Bachelor of Engineering last month
Now I'm going graduate school of Nagoya University
I learned many things during last year
They were not only special knowledges
My aim of this year is \"learn a lot and play a lot\" by efficient time management
I'm finally over with midterms
Finally the mid-terms are done now
But not for this year
This year, it means, finally I can focus on my research
My research is about the optimization of the maintenance strategy of electrical equipments
I have no idea how to solve this yet
I have only 5 month to finish this
So I have no time to repose
I haven't touched my electrical dictionary these days
This means I haven't used English these days
Learning English is not avoidable for my future
I have to spend more time with English
It had been really cold until last week
In the meddle of April, It's usually warm enough to go out with wearing only a long-sleeved shirt or sometimes casual jacket on it in here
But the day of last week, it was so cold that I needed to wear a down jacket even it's already spring
Today, the professor of the energy trasnsforming engineering class tould us some doubt of global warming
He described it from the viewpoints of the number of the sunspots, the axis of the earth and the earth's yearly round
He said that the earth is facing the global cooling now
He said it will cause a serious cool summer all over the world
The wether forecast said tomorrow gonna be cold
I just can't wait the nice warm spring
We took part in it as the YFU which is the exchange organization that took care of me while I was staying in America
I had been told that we were supposed to explain the activities of the YFU to students  who were interested in studying abroad
We have held such a meeting last month
So we supposed that this was bound to go easily
But it wasn't
Actually this event was a kind of extracurricular activities
There were a lot of other organizations such as the group of Japanese drum players, the welfare workers and the rival organization whose name is AFS
But all of them were mostly for people who want to study abroad
So the contents of slide show which we prepared were mostly about how to apply the YFU exchange program, the history of the YFU and the structure of the organization
So it was a serious type thing and wasn't a fun thing at all
The rival organization, AFS, was doing really fun thing
We totally mistook the purport of the event
We were feeling like lying on the bed of thorns
Last Saturday, we hold a Christmas Party for exchange students
There are nine exchage students staying in this Tokai area through YFU
YFU is the one of the world's largest exchange organization
I've been staying in America for a year as a exchange student 3 years ago through YFU
I really appreciate to Them
So, to replay and express my feeling of gratitude, I'm working for YFU as a volunteer now
These exchange students are returning to their homeland at the beginning of next month
So we wanted them to have one more another precious memory of Japan
This was why we held the christmas party
About the place for party hall, a gentleman who also has the exchange experience through YFU runs a cafe at midtown Nagoya and he let us to use it for the Party
That is really nice place
It consists of nice interiors and cool drawings are painted all over the walls
Maybe these are drawn by themselves
On the very day of the Christmas Party, it was lovly,over 30 people came
There were foreign exchange students,their friends and rest of them were belong to from my age to older even over 50
We entertained them for many snacks ,juices and Japanese traditional food Temaki-Sushi
We had the game named \" Russian roulette wasabi cream puff
Wasabi is Japanese horserasish
It is really pungent
After game,we enjoyed chatting with each other and the hall kept ranging with the sound of laughter
One of the exchange students had a birthday just on that day
So we celebrate her 17th birthday with so-cute birthday cake
I hope we could make unforgettable memory for them
I wish, finally,I want to pay everyone who helped to meke such successful Party my best compliment
I parked on the street around the university
And where I parked was only 2 meters away from the crossroad
I have to pay the penalty of it.｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡
The fine of illigal parking is ￥18000
This is so expensive
But I have to accept that, otherwise I will get arrested
Oh man, If I didn't commit, I could buy an another monitor and a graphic board
Oh, and just in case, I will upload the picture of the area that you are not allowed to park
Be careful when you park your car on the road
Last week we recieved a health screening report
It showed some unusual numerical value
And doctor said he has the metastasis spread of cancer of all around his body
Doctor also said his days are numbered, 3 month at most
I'm really proud of him
He has been helping my life
When I hoped to study abroad in America, he was the one who approved and paid whole expenses
He also paid my tuition fees, and what's more he is saving to prepare for my graduate school fees
When I get back from 1year studying abroad, I visited my grandparents first
He looked at me at onece ,and suddenly he stormed about my hair color
Can you yell to your grandson you see after an interval of a year
He couldn't overlook that I seemed like I changed the identity and lost my pride in beeing Japanese
So neext day, I had my hair cut really short, and colored my hair black
Then I visit them again and apologized
Because I think it is Japanese identity
He brought up me
I had never faced such situation, someone who is really close to me is dying before
At first, I kinda lost my grasp of what I was facing
I couldn't thought with what I should tell him
Strangely enough I hadn't been terribly grieved this week
Because I was too busy at my university stuff and other work I'm responsible for it
I really appriciate what he had given to me
And his inmost thoughts are living in me
Of course I wann't going to cry
I was rather going to relieve him
When I see him and his gaunt face, I couldn't check the flow of tear
I realized what I'm facing, he is passing away
I couldn't tell him what I was going to tell well because tears kept interefering
And also I realized I can not possibly put my gratitude into words
I vowed to work as much as I can and contribute to the world to his face
Beyond that, I only could tell him \" Thank you for everyghing, everyghing you gave to me.\"  And I left his house with saying \" See you later
If I die tomorrow, I would feel I couldn't put what he had gave to me to account enough
So I decided to try to take more oppotunities to tell my friedns, my jouniors and you who is reading my diary what I learned until now
And I'll try harder to leave more things to this world
I represents my honorable grandpa
I should never disgrace his honor
Today I had my third time of the English conversation class
We talked about the article, \"Asian youth forgetting how to write
First we were given a paper which is written the article but some sentences are blanked
Then the teacher read the article to us
And we filled out the blanks
What is your favorite pan?(ﾉ´∀｀
Oh, there is a home work due next week
Then it hit me
Does anyone know this one??(；´Д｀
My favorite one is, \"There was a sign on the lawn at a drug re-hab center that said 'Keep off the Grass
Today I went to the Atsuta shrine and the Shiratori Japanese style garden
A Shinto shrine is a structure which is made as the house of kami-sama
It's placed in a hour from my house but I had never been there
As you see in the picture, that was really, really beautiful
t I felt like \"the true colors of Japan\" was there
The second picture is the oldest bridge in Nagoya
There are some rules about paying homage at a shrine
2 You have to walk left side of the road because its center is for the kami-sama to walk
Then tap your hands twice , bow and wish your desire in your heart
At this point, you shouldn't speak your wish in voice
These are some of conventions of Shinto
But I saw many people didn't follow them
Japanese style gardens are often made in imitation of the real scenery
And this is the biggest Japanese style garden in Nagoya which imitated the scenery of this area
It has quaint atmosphere
I think leaves of the trees will turn in autumn and it must be really beautiful
It's been 2 days since I met you, my brain is full of you
Because if I touch you I think everything I've established gonna collapse
That fear alienate you
If I've got on you in my birthday suit, 
with holding by you until the moon sets over the sea, and share the panorama of the color of the sky
I would've not feeling this gloom
How many times will I have sleepless nights
I cannot concentrate on anything but I'm just more in love with you
dear my new bed
I'm not in good shape
This morning I woke up with the horrible stomachache
So I ran into the bathroom as soon as I left the bed
I don't feel good since last Saturday
This happens periodically
It's like the air is being thin only around me
I can't center my focus on the studying
I made a rule! 
On the day of my birthday, I made a rule to never fail to write a jounal everyday
This was way I was in haste last night
It is the biggest priority for me to make good on my promises
But I will keep up
I will try to be undaunted
Now it's 12:30 in Japan now
I don't know what else to say
It might be the best movie I've ever watched
I have watched many movies
But I had never watched such movie before
So I don't know how to remark on it
Actually, Radiohead’s Last Flowers is used as an overture for the film
I've heard the news that Hollywood is remaking it with Daniel Radcliffe and Nicole Kidman
I'm sure it will fall
Because I'm sure that it is impossible to make this movie except for Japanese
What I'm trying to say is, even if you are a great chef, you can't make a dish of Japanese cuisine with American seasoning
Ah, I cannot express my feeling well
There is only one thing that I am clear of it
It is I am glad that I could watch this movie
After we had lunch at 矢場とん, we went to the Nagoya Castle
Perhaps I had been there before, I didn't remember anything of it
It looked with reality
Then we moved to 栄 and went to the restaurant which serves cake buffet
They served more than 15 kinds of cakes and we could eat as many as we want
They serve cream puffs, custard puddings, short cakes, and many other cakes which I had never seen before
The clerks ,customers and everyone in the house sang birthday song toghether
We had plenty of cakes and great time
Then we took 名無しさん and Porschla to the bus station and they departured to Takayama
They had a free day in Nagoya because the flight reserved would departure this afternoon
depression
I feel tired the last few days
Our school's rock club declared that I become next year the activities leader of rock club
I have to host our club's activity of Sea Music Festival
A lots of things around me :club,schoolwork,relationships,activity
I feel so tired and I cried several times
I don't have time to do myself
How can I do
I feel so depression
how to make friends
When i am young,I find it's very easy to make a new friend
However,it's more and more hard now
Why?,I think it is because of the lack of trust
When we are litter,we even don't know what is right and what is wrong
