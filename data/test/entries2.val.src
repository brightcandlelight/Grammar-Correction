And he took in my favorite subject like soccer .
Actually , who let me know about Lang - 8 was him .
His Kanji 's ability is much better than me .
We 've known each other for only half a year , but his lesson was a lot of fun .
I heard a sentence last night when I watched TV .
When you go downhill , you have to stick out your chest or you will fell down .
When you go uphill , you hvae to bend your back .
It is like when you are confronted with frustration , you have to keep your confidence .
When you are go smoothly , you have to be more modest .
When I was at school , we painted a lot of wooden handicrafts like small plates and cases .
The making souvenir is a hard and interesting work .
Well , finally , my mother took me to the customs window , she gave a passport to man . . .
That 's two balls : one with a cat inside , other with dog .
You know , you can take them at slot machine .
The third memory is the house we lived .
It was situated near Helsinki , big and light house with the small lake behind it ( it was winter , so it was frozen ) .
Do n't know why .
I liked the winter Finland .
And I hope I like the summer Finland .
Just improvise already ! `` To tell the truth , I myself did n't expect what I CAN play like that I did .
If only I had black dense curtains .
A couple of weeks ago , I heard a new Whitney Houston 's tune on my car radio .
I had been wondering what she was doing .
It said that was disappointing .
Old and not beautiful . . . . .
I know her tumultuous marriage with Bobby Brown and an arduous battle with drug addiction .
Still she has n't recovered from them ?
More disappointing thing to me is she said the reason of her bad voice was because she talked with Oprah Winfrey too much on her show .
That might be one of the reasons , however , it sounds like just an excuse .
I would say after 10 years of waiting , it has not failed its title , at least from my first impression .
Anyway , I think I 'll spent quite some playing it in the next few weeks .
OK , let 's all for my first entry .
Before , I went to a library .
On the way I had a headache .
So , I think if we have to go somewhere on foot , we must put our hat .
If we did n't that and walk for long time , we will collapse or die .
If my sentences are n't practical correct them .
This morning I found out that one of my favourite band released his new album .
I already forgot about Rise Against an it is a great surprise for me , because I did n't return to them for 2 years .
I hope this band did n't become worse yet like many others big ones and I 'll enjoy listening it .
Well , there remains to get it and check it out .
It 's because my mum is probably the best cook I have met in my life .
Cooking is not her profession , she is a housewife .
I have ate at hotels and expensive meals but they are nothing like what she cooks .
I rather be working outside than be a housewife .
I think it 's about for one and half year .
I should have exploded whole this building so that I can make them destroy ~ ! ! !
I had to write about counseling .
This is my first time to write diary on the internet .
I hope someone see my diary and correct it .
I watched DVD `` Grey 's anatomy `` today .
Actually I keep watching it these days .
So there are a lot to see .
I do n't know medical word in English very much .
But I can study English through this .
And I think it 's fun , right ?
And I 'm eating a banana every day for my health .
The banana is gather in my stomach and gives me energy .
I have to make a newspaper in English as my summer vacation homework and I decided to introduce about my dog on the news paper .
I will introduce about my dog , Tiara .
She is cheerful and plump pretty dog , perhaps she is the cutest dog in the world .
She 's a golden retriever and she 's 8 years old .
Her fur is beautiful amber and soft .
She is little stupid , but has perceptive insights about food because she is always famished ^ ^ She loves food !
When she is basking she looks very comfortable .
however , I hoped rain because it is too hot .
I saw a news on Yahoo yesterday .
It reported that Chien - Ming Wang cut his hair and had a new hair style .
Here is the link .
It talked about there is a big difference about different values of a handsome man between Western countries and Eastern countries .
It mentioned many examples of Japanese men , Korean men and Hong Kong men .
They paid much attemtion to their faces and also spent lots of money to shop .
But in Western countries , the standard of a handsome man depends not on their faces , but on their masculine symbols , say , muscle and behavior .
I started to notice the ways of foreign clothing and hair styles these past days by watching TV programs , such as Friends , Srcubs and etc .
If they had a long hair , it will be really long and thick .
By contrast , men in eastern countries most dress up .
Except a shirt and a jean , we usually wear an accessory .
As to hair , men usually have a median hair , neither very short or long .
If we want to cut a very short hair , we must leave some hair on the back of neck in order to avoid looking like a nerd .
It almost cost a whole morning .
I have to watch the NBA final game 3 .
I like you give me any commets and opinoins too .
I really like to discuss .
My son have diarrhea
When I came back home from working today .
It was like a warter and son 's hip became red .
Tomorrow I will go to hometown .

Spring is very exciting season .

I loved the massage shop where I went because the staff of the shop explains what is wrong in my body .
After that , I went to a fittness club which has bedrock bathing .
I feel relax to take a bedrock bath ^ ^
I 'm went to Sendai to business trip today .
The special product in Sendai is a cow tongue .
I bought it and ate at home .
I want to eat its cow tongue again .
The daughter was woken up by my wife .
The wife was woken up by my stertor .
Where to do it and when we should leave is not decided yet !
So , even now I feel nervous , wondering if It ' really going to be held .
And I want to live my life on my own pace .
Because when I finished my classes , homeworks or jobs etc . . .
It 's nearly 10 pm when I back home .
It 's nearlly 12 pm .
These days I suffered many unhappy things .
Maybe those matters were not so bad as the facts , but I really could 't handle them while they occured together . . . .
I do n't know how to master this language well . . .
Though I spend most of my time and energy in learning English , it seems that I hardly make any improvement has become a truth . . .
I do n't know why I have to learn English so hard . . ! ! !
our teacher said a sentence to me , which made me heart broken . .
I had never knew my English was poor until the teacher told me that my English was sound illogically . . . .
Summer holiday

I went to Kanazawa university festival with my American friend .
I made good friend with Vietnamese .
we enjoyed well .
And we had a dinner with my another friends .
It 's a amazing day today .
It is made of spnge : ) It is cute .
I 've received the acceptance letter and scholarship decision from the Berklee College of Music .
I 'll enter the Berklee in the fall semester this year .
But I have two worries .
One of them is that my English is very clumsy yet .
Another is high - priced tuition .
Anyway , I 'm studying English at the TOEFL Institute these days .
The Berklee do n't requires a TOEFL score .
Many assignments are given to me everyday .
It 's very difficult to do all of them , but I always try to make maximum efforts .
I 'm laerning English , but it 's really difficult for me !
Several days ago , I got an irregular heartbeat for the first time in my life !
It was like this ; I suddenly started to feel a kind of discomfort around my heart .
I was very scary because I had been very healthy so far .
I 'm still in the 20 's .
Do I have to get along with it all my life ? ``
The doctor told me that I did have a irregular pulse ossacionally but it was not a fatal one .
He added that it could get worse due to stress and fatigue , and he just advised me to take an enough rest .
I was releaved to hear the doctor 's diagnosis but I 'm still worried .
I think that may be a common question for those students want to pursue a higher education .
What Chinese universities offer for their students are mostly composed by coursework base curriculum .
I 've sum up some points which I think important and useful .
You can count on google as your best friend , adviser and an almost infinite resources of academic papers .
Many of them you can download pdf copy , or If you ca n't download paper from the links scholar . google . com offer you , go directly to the author 's website , many authors enjoy their paper to be seemed and cited by potential readers .
A good review is the best start point .
And then you can trace the author , or the paper cited to do a more in depth research in your interested area .
The balance of width and depth of your reading is essential .
Both way have its merits and disadvantages .
Inovative and original idea is good , but if you can not find them , you should know that most of research work is just refinement of other 's work .
I 'll spend the next weeks on board of the `` Justo Sierra `` vessel making some geophysical research and learning .
Bad thing , I have n't learned the vessel 's parts in English yet .
The thing that I want to make in January 2009 is to invest more effort in studying English and keep on writing sentences in English every day here , Lang - 8 !
However there were not so many people there , so we do not need to wait our turn outside .
I think that Manga is the great entertainment culture from Japan .
My favorite writers are Naoki Urasawa ( The Monster , 20st century boy and more ) and Hiroya Oku ( Gantz ) .
By the way , I found some web sites that there are huge amount of Mangas that translated in English .
( I think no doubt about illegal . )
It 's a new experience and very educational of English .
But , I think that there are a lot of difficult expressions in Mangas in English .
Diagnosed of being easily impressed
I realized that I 'm that kind of people who are easily impressed .
I 'm moved by very simple things and other people might not even have a second look at .
For instance , I started watching Indian movies about a month ago .
When I had the time , I brought about six Indian movies to watch .
The first movie I watched , made me cry for two hours like a five year old who lost her doll .
Actually all the Indian movies have the same basic idea .
However , I continued crying during the rest five and each one of them impressed me even more .
Indian movies are like clay that you can shape into many different shapes but they 're all still made of clay .
This concept might be a bit ambiguous for those who have n't been in such situation .
I took a medicine , so I feel better for now .
`` 450th times ``
This is my 450th times diary .
I started keeping a diary around the 2008 .
Thanks to the people all over the world , I 'm having a fun time and solid time .
Changing the subject , I got my call from my friend yesterday .
I recently out of shape . `` I was somewhat puzzied for an answer .
Hello ! My name is Ken .
I 'm study of English was started .
However , it is terrible and difficult .
The novel is about a important roman politican called Caius Marius .
He is de main character , although appearing others like Cornelius Silla , Metelus , and the Caesar 's grandfather .
Marius did n't come from a important family , but he became in consul because he was a clever and popular general at roman army .
So , after he was chose consul by the romans , he went to Afrika where he fought againt Yugurta who was king of Numidia .
Marius won the war in two years , and when he went back to Rome he was chose consul again during five years .
Marius had to fright other tribes at north of Italy , until in 100 B .

I love study .

I 've just received a international call by my cellphone .
I was wondering if that was from my friend 's call .
But that 's from Korea 's quarantine depot ,
We do n't have this symptoms now .

Although most people think about what happiness is like , most people never doubt there are happiness somewhere in human 's life .
A famous man , I heard , said in the past that the worst things for you is to be born in the world .
This is my nickname .
I studied applied physics and electronics at a university in Tokyo .
I took a bachelor 's degree of these subjects at the university .
I changed jobs a few times but the same type of job as an engineer .
I still work for an electronics maker in Japan as an engineer .
My parents and a brother and a sister live in Tokyo .
Fukuoka is located the northern part of Kyushu .
Kyushe is a part of the Japanese Archipelago .
Comparing with Tokyo , Fukuoka is compact but it is a very comfortable city .
Commodity prices here are lower than those in Tokyo and Fukuoka Airport is very near central Fukuoka .
You know , Narita Airport is far from central Tokyo .
Moreover Tokyo is a very crowded city .
One thing I unsatisfy to live here is that I 'm separated from my family .
It takes much money to go see my parents from here .
English lesson for Halloween
I 'm an elementary school teacher as you might know .
In Japan , starting next year we 'll officially have to teach English to students who are in both 5th grade and 6th grade .
I 've made some English classes , actually .
The lesson 's topic was Halloween .
We provided some kinds activities to get the students not only to keep enjoying the lesson but also to keep some vocabulary in mind before they know it .
One of them is `` Halloween trivias and Bingo `` .
The student need to answer some questions about Halloween I 've prepared by playing Bingo .
The more correctly they answer , the more Bingo they can get .
After the class , I asked the students to answer a questionnaire .
I was very glad to find they liked the lesson .
One of my ultimate goal as an English teacher is that all students look the world broadly .
I 'm sure you 'll have plenty of opportunities not only to communicate people from other countries but also to know several cultural differences through the lesson .
I believe this will lead them to accepting more things .
That 's why I 'm very excited with teaching studens English ! !
It is cloudy or rainy recently .
Although my school was no lecture , I got up early in the morning today .
It cost six dollars to washing and cost six dollars to the dryer .
When I washing ended , it was evening .
I went to the cake shop in the city my friend introduced to me as nice taste and famous .
The shop of inner decorating was green .
After came back home , I cooked dinner , and the dinner was prawn & avocado salad , roast chicken and OTAMA SAN GOHAN .
First , cut lettuce , cut coarsely a tomato and then stair - fly some prawns .
The OTAMA SAN GOHAN is Japaneseonly traditional food .
It only sprinkles the raw egg and a pinch of the soy source on warm rice .
They were easy cooking but they tasted nice ! !
After that I watched two movie , animation of genius boy and 007 , on TV for approximately four hour .
I appreciate to teach English to my daughter .
I was looking for English class around here .
We thought just taking a trial lesson , but she told me that I want to go to the lesson again .
I am very surprised to her progress .
Now she is very interested in speaking English , writing alphabets and sings WHAT ' S YOUR NAME ?
Her progress owe to you .
It will be base after she will go to new school .
If I did n't need to take care of my kids , I wanted to have your lessons !
It is very easy to come with kids because it is clean , safe , just a 1 - hour time difference and available Haneda airport .
After classes of university , I went back home directly , prepared packages and searched what time I should leave home and which trains I should take .
And if the team win 8 games , the team will get first position .
But remainder of its games is 9 games .
Therefore it is so difficult for it to get first position .
The starting pithier was not good , so that the opposition could get 3 points easily .
We cheered very hard , but the miracle was never happened .
Those are playing sports , reading a book , lithening to music , taking a walk and so on .
My favorit hobby is talking with my friends , because I think it is the best time to be with my friends .
I gained about 10 kilograms after I quitted my clubs in high school .
That 's why I have to lose my weight ! ! !
So , I jog and exercise always .
I wanna have the six - pack ! ! haha

The otehr day I met one of my classmate in high school at a station for the first time in fifteen years .
I 'm English teacher .
She is teacher for walking and posture .
We had small talk ( short talk ? ) there , and left .
When I started to walk , I thought I want to talk with her more !
So I shouted her name and stopped her .
We exchange our contact info and decided to meet again very soon .
We met two weeks ago , I felt strange , because we did n't meet each other for many years , but we have many things to tell each other .
Plenty of things to talk , but not enough time .
We should n't sort people into level , but I believe we are living in same level ( same category , same world ) .
I do n't like watching a close screen so I killed time reading something .
Today , I read `` The catcher in the rye `` as a summer homework .
To say the truth , I could not understand why this book is thought a masterpiece .
Because I did n't feel bored when I was reading it , but I was not so excited or moved .
If you had read the book , please tell me which part you think interesting .

Culture of shames
Foreign medias admire that Japanese people are behaving calmly , organised and in a supporting .
But it 's common for we Japanese .
We think that having trouble others is very bad thing and shameful .
Every parent want their children not to have trouble others .
Japanese have grown rice which need to help each other in the community the past .
I 'd be glad if you correct my mistakes .
Thanks a lol .
I did n't know why I lie but at that time I was blank I = out .
It was a job I seeked from the news paper .

Today I saw a movie - Twilight .

Yesterday , Japan national soccer team played against Australia .
The game was the final of Asia Cup in 2011 .
Five days ago , Japan team played 120 minutes , including extra times , against South Korea , furthermore , the average of height of Australia team is taller than Japan .
So I thought most of the Japan members are tired and the game is very hard for Japan team .
The game was into extra time two times in a row from semi - final game for Japan .
However , at 110 minute , Lee , who came off the bench , got the goal !
I 'm very glad to win Japan team !
Do you like singing songs ?
I like very much .
Today , I went to a karaoke box with my son and naighbors .
I sung so many songs and brewed my stress .
My favorite karaoke songs are Seiko Matsuda 's .
Her songs are easy to sing , familiar with many people and rytmycal .
I had a relaxed time .
Today I might fall asleep soon .
Maybe I got a guitar to my father long ago .
maybe he 's still its owner .
I do n't know but I often use it more than him . . .
Do my best !

I wonder what I give her present , so could you give me some advice ?
Foreigners baby
I can meet foreigners if I go to city in Tokyo but I wo n't be able to meet a foreigners baby .
It 's only adult or childs that I can meet .
I like a baby so I 'm always like to meet a foreigners baby if I have an oppotunity .
He 's living for 10 years in Japan so he likes to talk with Japanese people .
I think our language skill was even .
He wants his baby to speak Japanese so He 's learning Japanese everyday .
Recently , I 'm fascinated with a TV series named `` How I met your mother . `` ( Though I do n't watch it on TV but the Internet because is has n't introduced into Taiwan .
He always make his own theory about life !
Today , since people turn out to be more and more rational and have higher demands about the opposite sex , alone with an open mind about dating which nurtured tons of different reality dating shows .
This show features with `` Parents dating Guys `` .
The process is like this , the girl 's parents will meet the guys first , then they will make the decision for their own daughters who is not even on the scene , by the way , about whether should give this guy a chance to go out for a date with their daughters or not .
Dont understand why so many people are into these stuff , I deceided to arrange some nice dates for my friends by following my own style .
A date which can exude both parties ' warmth and charisma .
Sounds a lit bit tricky ?
Without audiences , love judges , parents , just a friendly and private atmosphere which allows them to be theirselves and enjoy the moment .
Last night was a second date I arranged for my friend and hopefully they can work things out !
play two roles
I 'm a business worker weekday and a student at graduate school 3days in a week .
I enrolled the school in this April .
Hard home work is required sometimes , but it is funny to get new knowledge and thought .
In the business , I challenge a task that I have not ever done .
this is also very valuable for me .
Without fail where there 's great need , great hearts and minds rise up to meet the challenge .
Two mouth later , my professor will take some students to Ohio university in America for a month .
But who wants to go there , he must pass the exam and the interview .
Going abroad is my dream , so I really cherich this opportunity .
It is a good chance to strengthen my knowledge , boarden my horizon , and enjoy the foreign customs , and also realize my dream .
Without any means , what I can do now is to improve my poor English , speaking more , listening more and reading more and so on .
In my opinion , it is a difficult process to overcome myself , but I must insist on and keep on making it , whatever how difficult it is .
Once you make up your mind , so persevere in doing it .
I was suprised when I found it . I have been study English for 2years . Because I want to make a lot of friends all over the world .
Yesterday , Kitajima Kousuke who is a breast stroke swimmer , he got the gold medal .

Wish You Happy In Paradise
I just listened his Boyzone 's brilliant song `` No Matter What `` on the way back home .
Stephen is cute and brave but now he is gone .
When I was in junior high school everything seems boring and no meaning , also I did poorly in study .
One day , I was failed to pass the examination .
At that time I have no place to go , parentes hate a underachieved me but suddenly a fair - sounding floating to my ear ' I ca n't deny what I believe I ca n't be what I 'm not ' I was astonished by the voice and lyrics which cheered me up .
Your lovely face look like a ray of hope .
Wish you happy in paradise
With knowing comes caring , with caring there is an hope that we can find an enduring place within the natural system that supports us .
Oil has been flooding in the gulf of Mexico for three months .
There has been only 15 days without war since human being started recording of history which means uncountable people have been killed and killing at the same time .
On the other side of the world , a great number of people live in less than 1 dollar .
Apparently , the world is lopsided .
All of a sudden , I am wondering how many of us believe we know what 's going on outside , watching lots of news as CNN or New York Times play out .
I 'm building an algorithm of computer program even when I have a dream in the night , because I 'm doing computer program all day long .
It was n't correct algorithm , it 's like a block puzzle .
I 'm piling that blocks up or sorting or something .
For 10 month , I studied Java and Japanese .

Really , I though `` could I do make it ? ``
Sometime , I felt frustrated and despairing .

You can learn a lot of things , like how to use a kind of pen , and meet a lot of people , even they are not always very kind .
It 's too short in break time .
Oh , how wanderful the college life is !
Once you get into the society , your life won ' 't be simiple as that in college .
After each team submits its proposal , there 's a week for the people to vote their faouvorite on the web .
There 's a final prize for the three ones scoring highest at the end of the contest : they all can enrol for free in a postgrade major course ( or a language one , if they have n't finished their career ) .
Additionally , the first team get to travel to New York !

As I had just bought a Motorola Milestone ( the european version of Droid ) , I gave it to my father , who 's actually very happy with it , since it 's a cute small nokia with wifi .
We go firsts now , but since they try to give one prize to a different team each time , we expect the jury to make the ones who go third win this time .

This will result in rapid aging society with fewer children .
I 'm looking forward to see them !
My NY life is getting change .
For example , today I ordered some clothes on the internet shop !
I felt fulfillment !
When I was in Seoul I used to shopping on website .
There are many products that are more cheaper than off - line stores .
After left Seoul , I did n't use the on - line stores .
I could n't believe the method of charging .
Because it was much simple than Korea method .
I just need credit card numbers , that 's all !
I was worried , whether another people catch my numbers .
Finally , I choose the official web site .
Because I could feel more safe and comfortable .
There is no A & F official store in Korea , so private people sell that brand clothes .
And the prices are very expensive ! !
Because of this experiences , I could n't stop shopping on A & F website .
I ordered some clothes and they are going to ship on FEB .
I 'm a little bit disappointed about the speed of shipping , but it does n't matter , I 'm really satisfied with the price and design of clothes .
I expect the arriving would be happen very soon !

Hello ! I 'm sorry to late dialy ; (
Today , I had sleeped only two hours .
So I feel sleeping all day .
Why I still up late , because I watched ladies soccer game ! The game was Japan called `` Nadeshiko Japan `` vs America .
The half game was score less drow , the second half was drow .
Extra game was drow too ! I was very strained by PK ! I 'm afraid of watching PK .
Fighnaly , Japan won the game , so `` Nadeshiko Japan `` is top team in the world ! ! I was exciting , so I ca n't sleep ; ) But I do n't regret watching soccer .
I want to play something sports ! Thank you very much : )
I decided that I will write diary everyday at lang - 8 about dairy thing to learn English .
Today , I took a walk around my house by bicycle .
I visited Freemarket which held at park .
The sounds of the steps
Yes , it is my boss 's one .
I thank my ear for my survival until now .
So many MMA fighters thought I want to be more stronger than I thought .
This is the most necessity thing for them but my opinion is deffrent from them .
Even if they are strong but they sometimes counld n't win .
Because MMA is sports but they should n't think MMA is sports .
There are a fighters who do n't think MMA is not sports and if they seems to lose the fights they are going to try to kill their competitor and so that sometimes the strong lost by the weak .
I want to say is no future in just only the strong .
Fedor who is Russian , I think he is the one of them .
He is called the one of the best fighter in the world .
3 : 25 a . m . at JST

Everyday , I 'm very hard to learn it .
But recently , I wanted to speak English .
If I speak English fluently someday , I want to go abroad .
And I want to see the wonderful architectures of foreign countries .
That 's why , I started it .
I woke up earlier than recently today .
Because I felt headache and heavy stomach .
I thought why I felt bad in the bed .
I had a dinner at 11pm yesterday and slept down as soon .
I did n't feel that before several years , I did same things .
I was disappointed that I was not young already !
We have three days holiday , so I spend these days on playing .
Yesterday I got up late as usual , and then had lunch , went to supermaket with my good friend , and bought something to my family .
Yesterday was a buzy day , but very happy .
I feel the time past faster than usual .
I elder than before .

It was very difficult work because we have to fag overtime .
We have many foreigneres as our clients and I really could try my strength in English ) It ` s so interesting to tolk with the Britishes , Germanes , Italianes , Danes , Finnes , Croates . . .

Asashoryu is a Sumo champion .
Sumo is one of the Japanese traditional sports .
He has been accused of puching a man while drunk recently .
Sumo champion , called yokozuna , is required to be strong not only phisically , but also spiritually .

An Backpacker
During the last summer vacation , I traveled around Asia ; Melaka & KL ( Malaysia ) , Siem Reap ( Cambosia ) , and Bagan ( Myammer ) .
I met a Japanese Backpacker When I was in KL .
We became friends soon .
He is experienced backpacker .
He said He traveled around this world .
Especially I like His stories in Thailand and India .
That was really fun .
Kinabalu in Borneo Island .
It says He is in Isreal now .
Then I know Backpacker is always freewheeling .
I have n't understood the system of this well yet , however , I ca n't help posting my first diary .
Actually , everybody in my company counts on me when it comes to English , for example , the customer or the documents from U .
But as you know , my writing ability is like a child play .
I 'm always dreaming to get my English composition proofread by English native speakers .
If you notice something , for example , grammatical error , unnatural expression , please tell me .
This time , I dare to write a diary without using my dictionary .
May it is sunny tommorrow . . .
May it is sunny tommottow . . .
I 'm planning to go climbing the mountain with friends tommorow .
I wish it 'll be sunny . .
It is said from long time ago that you can be healthy and happy or your wis come true if you climb this mauntain .
On the top of mountain , there is a shrine contracted in 700 's .
We , friends since Junigor high scholl , are very interested in this legend .
Water , lunch , and own wish will be packd in our each backpack .
Because it has been raining for 3days , I made `` TERUTERU - BOZU `` wishing sunshine .
It is old custom to make it in Japan although only children do it in these day . .
Usually tit is hung under the roof , but I could ' nt do it .
Everyone who joined this class were very good .
Even midleage man was better than me !
I am beginner .
I made mistakes a lot .
Hysterically , I am a well planned person so there are always full of schedules that keep me from anything spontaneous .
So to speak , there are certain things I have to do almost every day before the sun sets off such as reading a book , watching news , and writing anything .
Ironically , I find it enjoying hanging out with my friend who came here early morning , taking a whole day from me , doing something stupid such as killing flies , making me think what is more important .
I am very stressful ~ now .
It is very difficult to say anything . .
so , I said English with wrong words . .
It was the kingdergardan level ~ ~ . .
When I talk , I forget what I say , ,
Grammer was also wrong . .
I only say that `` I like ~ I want . . ``
very simple things . .
I felt very tired .
It 's very lovely .
It looks like some jewelries .
I thought there were about a hundred thousand people at the grounds .
I had never seen such a many people , so I was very surprised : ) .
By the way , what do you like to do in summer ?
Plese tell me : D
Yesterday , I went to Home Depo to buy a bag of soil and a planter .
I wanted to do repotting of my roses .
The roses grew up and thir flowerpots are too small for them .
And also I wanted to do sowing of sweet basil seeds and oregano seeds .
Oh , I just remember , I also bought a seat of starting pots for that herbs .
It took long time to do that but I was happy , so I like gardening .
a patio , not garden .
I wanted to do sowing of Violas but starting pots was lack , so I would go to Home Depo again tomorrow .
a ) I 'm lacking in the sensitivity to whether an expression is formal or informal .
b ) I have to cultivate ( enhance / enrich / sophisticate ) the sensitivity to others ' feelings .
I do n't like leaning English in school by two years ago .
But , I became like to English because I began thinking by myself .
Lang - 8 is good place for languages leaning , and it give enjoyment to us .
I 'm able keep at it .
Especially , in company , there are many relations .
I want to know how does communicate with each other in foreign countries .
It does n't mean I 'm not going well .
I think I cought a cold : - (
I took a medicine , but I still feel bad .

I words in An e - commerce company .
I like English , but did not and I communicate in English , my English has been declining .

Their parents send children on their first errand .
It 's a little bit expensive for me , but I 'm so happy to get it .
I carry it anywhere , and show it to my friends .
I decided that I manage it as carefully not to break .
Sometimes , When I get back from college , I feel that I can do absolutely nothing but watching a movie .
I feel so exhausted but I can not sleep because If I slept then when I wake up , I 'll have to start studying again or going to college .
Epidemy of Cool
Here is ending .
The afterquake is still happening in Japan , Kanto area .
But the stuation is being recovering by helping not only Japanese but aloso all over the world .
Unfortunately , we ca n't say there is no problem at Fukushima reactor .
I am going to move out to Saitama ( Kanto area ) from here just because I study at the university in Saitama .
I 'm very worry about the radiation .
We do n't know when the situation recover perfectly .
The worst thing in the world is sitting in a room with only your pen and watch the time go away
Prey for me : D : D
Reading Books in a bath
My precious time is the time when I read books taking a bath !
I usually take a bath more than half an hour .
I think knowing others ' love affair does n't make any sense for me .
I like the stories which can not be expected and be like a roller
I thought earthquake is coming when I wash my face in the morning .
I 'm so nervous at earthquake .
I made an emergency bag in case .
And I have to fix my furnitures to stop slipping .
It is very nice .
We walked around the garden , we saw the animals and differents trees ; we had a smoll lunch
I like making a plan , but I ca n't fulfill my plan .
I think I 'm a lazy person , so I tend to choose an easy way .
I want to do many things for one day .
On the other hand , I think I spend too many hours to use a computer .
It is fun indeed , but it is waste time for me .
If I quite checking sites so many often , I think I can save my time more .
I need to reconsider about how to use a time .
Though I 'm not good at using a time at all , I want to try to be good at using a time .
I must make a good schedule which I never give up on it way to .
I want to have more strong mind to keep my schedule , and I want to control a time , not time control me .

The club has some small stages and I was dancing on it then a guy came to dance with me .
After 5 or 10 minutes dance , at last he noticed I 'm a man .
He was like ' OMG ! ! ' n hold his head .
Anyway I enjoyed a lot ! !
I wasted too much time on watching Youtube .
I watched without any want to watch .
Political ones are always full of childish swearings .

Today is hot and sunlight is strong .
So , I got sunburned a little .
I felt summer will come soon in Japan .
I like winter than summer .
So , I hope that summer will pass fast .
Strange Japanes custom ?
An interesting TV show was aired last Saturday .
One of them is drinking alchole outside , because most countries do n't seem to be allowed to drink .
It is not a smart behavior in Japan either , but we have a lot of fuss once a year outside .
During that season , no one pay much attention even we are drunk , make noise .
The next moment we rather become friends with other groups enjoying over there .
In Japan , strange custom is remained as for hanami .
When we have hanami , we have to get place before starting .
It seems to be their first task .
So , whenver I pass by , I am sure they must be new employees .
Today , my country is rainy .
Very hot , and It was dry .
But , we have to finish term examination .
I can not come to here for around 2 weeks .
If a test is over , I come again .
He has worked at a customer service representative about an insurance .
So he will try to study about something in that his time .
But he has no idea that he should study about .
Japanese economy is so bad now .
We are concerned about when we lose our job .
If he lost his currently job , he would n't know what he should do .
Now , Wii my house .
Recent TV game is amazing .
It is very convenient to codeless .
By the way , dou you know ' Lucky Taxi ' ?
Yesterday , I took a taxi , driver give me a card . ( picture )
It was a little happy day .
Are these sentences OK ? ? : )
Children cry to turn mother 's attention to them .
Today , I was very free .
So , I thought that what to do .
Then , I remembered very important thing .
My room is so messy because I was busy recently .
So , I clened my room very hard .
I was too tired .
T `` is challange time .
It 's easy for me to study it .
I do n't like science too .
I came back to home .
I went to a park ,
So , I enjoyed playing soccer and baseball with my friends .
It ( is able to / may ) rain at any moment .
Please lend me a pen to write ( with / on ) .
I 'm no longer suprised that situation .
All I want to know is that why they could n't come to my calss .
I asked someone about why they were not here .
He explaned the reason in Swahili , so I was n't able to understand , but I realized that they were in under the punishment .
Do you remember my journal which I wrote 2 days ago ?
Today 's calss is the same class which I was n't able to teach them because of CHOTA MAJI .
Tanzanian students are differ from Korean students .
When I was in Korea , if we skipped the calss because of other affairs , they seemed very happy .
However , in here , my students do n't want to skip the calss .
Whenever I have a class at night ( actually , sometimes we have an extra class at night like today ) , I was satisfied of my students who listened devouring every word .
So I have to dug my first MP3 ( 1GB ) out from my drawer .
Well , it can not satisfied me .
And I fall in love with the liberary in our school ! ! !
I always stay there for a long time all day .
By the way , listen to music there is also a good choice ~ ( ha , ha )
Do you take a nap ?
I used to lie down on the sofa after finishing it .
Recently I read a book about the digestion .
Acording to this , taking a nap is not good for digestion .
It recomends us that even if we are sleepy after lunch , we should not sleep ,
and if we get very sleepy , we should go for a walk to forget our sleepness .
Finally I decided to practice it .
After lunch of today , I brought the book to the sofa and began to read it .
But two hours later I found I had been sleeping until that time .
I went to sleep after all today too .
I wonder I will be able to stay up tomorrow .
My sister took entrance exams a few days ago , and she 's waiting her results .
My brother will take it in this Friday .
My sister is university , my brother is high school .
First , I can see some movements of peoples to recover from the damage now .
When the earthquake had happened , the economic activity was depressed strongly .
We thought that it was not good to have a satisfied days when people in the damaged area were suffered .
Although that , we have already realized that the stagnant economy was more bad for the recovery of Tohoku area .
For instance , the usages of the area contaminated by the nuclear energy are now discussed on Japanese newspapers frequently .
I hope Japan will recover from this situation and reply other countries for their helps in the future .
Jpanese energy policy
By the great big earth quake in March 11 , Japanese energy policy has changed drastically .
Many people claim that `` we should not use nuclear power plant ! !
`` It 's true that radiation pollute people or vegetables , soil , air and sea more or less .
However , I do n't think that nuclear power plant should stop immediately .
Because if we ca n't use electricity fully , electricity fee will increase and some corporation decide their factory to move foreign country .
Then , Japanese employment will face great big difficulty .
Most of Japanese people ca n't speak English .
So if we lose our employer , we ca n't have job !
After that , we change our electricity souse to natural one .
We do n't have to change our energy policy if we ca n't do that safely .
This is the thing which often Japanese wives say `` Which is important I ' am or your work ! `` .
It 's same question .
Yet she always answer wrong at the same questions that I had taught several times , like negative number multiply by negative number is positive number .
She just casually answered the questions and sort of appeared impatient , which made me sort of angry .
Yet I has reflected on myself of my behavior back home .
I heard that before but I 've never played it and every one over there neither .
After having a beerpong , many people played with it but a funny thing happened on that day .
Two guys were completing against each other for running in an athletic game .
Both of them does not know how to run in the game exactly .
One of the guy tries to run by lifting up his knees a lot and the others are not .
Actually , it requires lifting up their knees higher enough to make Kinect senser to sense their move , so he was correct and keep the fastest speed in the race .
However , the problem is he is a bit too serious so he started moving toward the TV monitor little by little , then finally he slipped on a floor and fell down .
As the result , suddenly he became 7th in the race which is the second from last .
So , the race turns out really funny one since one guy fell down and the other guy runs his slow pace .
It resulted in getting 7th and 8th .
Everyone started laughing and I was feeling like a documentary of a race with a guy who did n't give up even though he fell down in a middle of the race and a guy who keeps running slowly but never give up .
Be careful during running even though it 's a game .
^ ^ It seems nothing , but very real happiness to me .
At the same time , I want to get how to say no gently because I want to have much happier moment than sleeping in the morning !
I 'm their older sister .
I do n't know what gifts prepared my parents .
In the evening we will nave a little party with barbeque .
And of course there will be some our friends with their kids .
UW means University of Washington , which locates in a beautiful city whose name is Seattle .
Before I went to school this morning , I spent one hour jogging around a big lack which is Green Lake near my neighborhood .
I went to balloon lecyurer as an assistant in `` OMOCHA OUKOKU `` .
A main lecturer was `` DOISAN `` from `` MAGIC POT `` .
But today is rainy day and yet many audience participated balloon lecturer .
Almost all the audience is family .
I difficult to lecyurer for small children .
I Miss You In Loneliness
We live in the world for reasons , some of us live only to live up with their parents and so on .
I am no one of them , but I also miss someone with heart and soul when I feel lonely .
The first one comes to my mind is my grandma .
My mother suicided herself when I was only a baby born one year and since my father worked far far away in the town , I was brought up by Grandma .
As a child , being naughty , I brought about a lot trouble to Grandma , sometimes I even broken her heart .
