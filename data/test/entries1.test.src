Yes ter day I went to dr in k ing with my friend s with when I was co ll e g e st ud ent .
One of them is work ing at J a p an e se a ut o m a k er .
Some time s he is going to around of world .
en j ot it !
I de c id ed to read al o ud with A F N b ook .
A first se ction was the in a u g ur al address of B ar a c k O b a m a as the n ation ' s 44 th p re s id ent .
U s u ally I take I - po d to he ar some m us ic and English pro g r a m s .
To day I found a new things about English .
The sen t ence is `` I can not than k you enough ``
I have felt this sen t ence sound s that person do n ' t a p p re c i ate .
Y e a I le ar n ed to day one thing to day .
I give the fish which was his sp e c i al favor ite to his gra ve .
I can think of nothing , because of I am tired now , or just p re ten d ing to be tired now .
What I am do ing now look s like nothing but coming from no where , or just it is that I have to think more to find out what is need ed .
I have trouble with study , live l i h o o d and my girl friend ( may b e leave soon )
I went to c a f e near my school to read b ook s and I walk ed for a long time .
H on est ly I have to cha ll e ng e G er man writing .
But it does n ' t mean that I give it up .
There are a l ot of st ud ent from va ri ous co un t ri es .
E ng l an s d , I ta ly , A ust ri a , S l o v a k i a , S er b i a e t c .
S in ce this was the first time for me to see S l o v a k i a un d S er b i a people ,
A l m o st all con ver s ation was in English , but I would have to say I had much difficult y to co m m un ic ate with them .
My co m m un ic ation s k i ll in English is not enough , and particular ly for listen ing .
A d d i tion to it , every body has different a c c ent s in English includ ing me .
So they tri ed to me m or i z e it as s o c i at ing with `` H i ro s h im a ( J a p an e se c ity ) ``
It sound s funny , I never hi t upon such a idea .
But I think H i ro s h i is e as i ar than H i ro s h im a , because it ' s short er , is n ' t it ?
N ic e to me e t u ~ ~ I ' m a fresh man here ~ ~ I was b or n in c he ng d u , C h in a .
I ho pe I can make friend s with u ~ ~
H o pe every on e may have a n ic e day ~ ~

When I happen d to walk by in front of k im on o sh op , a c ut e you ng c l er k we ar ing k im on o talk ed to me with s m il ing .
Some pretty girl s we ar ing k im on o were in K y ot o or U n ive r s al S t ud i o J a p an of O s a k a on the picture s .
We talk ed about k im on o s or something for a long time .
The c l er k said , `` If you had a time , why do n ' t you try this on ? ``
O f c or se I tri ed .
B e c a us e I had an enough time and I do n ' t have any k im on o s in s te ad of y u k at a .
The k im on o which I tri ed was re ally beautiful .
I sat is f i ed with try ing it on and had f un with talk ing with the c l er k .
But K im on o is very ex p en s ive , I do n ' t a f f or d to bu y it now .
It see m s that to day will be re ally n ic e day .
In the s k y are n ' t any c l o ud s , the s un is sh in ing and no w in d .
A l s o there are 3 de g re es by C el s i us , but it only 1 1 a . m . To day I ' m going to play b as ke t b a ll in the s k ate p ar k .
B y the way in the N B A O k la h o m a C ity T h un d er s w in s ver s us L .
L a k er s and now s er ies are 2 - 2 .

I ho pe C a v al i er s will w in .
It is as if sp r ing had come already here in C h u b u are a , in the c ent er of J a p an .
This is a quick di g re s s ion , and the head qu ar ter of hot T O Y O T A is here .
And y e aster day was my pay day , so I dr e w some money at A T M .
But it took no less than 1 0 0 yen to with d r a w as it is on sat ur day .
you see , just to with d r a w !
The b an k s are so bu d e t - mind ed , why should I pay money to with d r a w my money ?
What do you think ?
T h ough I make f us s over it , I take out on week en d s .
B y the way , I walk ed to the con v i ence st or e on f o ot since it ' s so near .
I could see many sp r ing f l ow er s out there , and I was able to feel sp r ing act u ally is around the corner .
I looked up other w or d s to mean w ar m and found as s n u g as a bu g in a r u g .
I found it very interest ing .
My name is p h y ten !
I am a st ud ent in H it ot s u b ash i U n ive r s ity who se de p ar t ment is e c o m ic s .
My ho b b y is . . .
G u it ar , read ing b ook s ( es pe c i ally business and f in ance ) , bad m in t on , the In ter ne t , pro g r a m m ing , and talk ing my friend s !
A l s o we can play with our ne i g h b or s , so not only we can make a friend s but also we can sp en d a time great ly .
M a y b e I gue s s there is a saying , `` There will be for t un es to people who do n ic e ly to their ne i g h b or s . `` .
If we sha re the f o o d s to our ne i g h b or s when they are becom ing poor , then we can get a f o o d s to them when they become o k a y and I became poor .
N e x t , we should get a manner .
N e i g h b or s are the part of our life and so c i e ty , and all of the people like the ne i g h b or s who are very n ic e ly .
And if we should be friend ly , help ful , and get ting a manner if we want to become a n ic e ne i g h b or .
I finish my work now .
I f i x ed a pro g r a m co d e .
On this line ' N in j a ' train s - n i j a ' s face pai n ted on - run every day .
But the train I ' m tak ing is not ' N in j a ' train .
It ' s did n t mean s I get los t but los t my b an k c ar d .
R e c ent ly , I W as always a b s ent - mind ed for any reason .
K e e p think ing something no matter walk ing on the ro ad or sit ing in the train .
A fter I find out the c ar d was not in the right place .
I po ur out the b a g and c he c k 3 time s with an x i ous .
But still c a n ' t find it .
Then , I call my family im m ed i ate ly to let them have the los e re p or t for the b an k .
I can not do this any more .
But what I can do ?
I ' ve just got home , re c ent ly I got back home l ate because of the job .
I re ally want to say than k you for every one who c or re c t my mistake s and give me a me s s age .
I am now being an ex ch an g st ud ent in A m er ic an , and this is the first time I live without my family , so my p ar ent s w or ri ed a l ot when I said good - bu y to them at the a ir p or t .
But I re as s ur ed them by saying that I would sen d e m a il .
My first g l ance at my room m ate act u ally left a very good impress ion on me because she was 5 year s old er than me , which made me feel she would s up p or t me in so many way s .
When I ar ri v ed my room , she was just with her J a p an e se bo y f ri en d , so she in t ro d u c ed him to me and told me that if I had any J a p an e se question s , I could just t um ble them out to her bo y f ri en d s .
I felt that I was so l u c k y that G o d ga ve me s u ch a n ic e room m ate because she seemed to be very pro te c t ive .
F or a girl who left home first time , it re ally help ed a l ot ! !
A t least , she ga ve a a sen se of se c ur e though her bo y f ri en d always stay ed in our room even at the be d time .
To let my room m ate know that I would bo t be a th re at to her re l ation s h i p , I always brought up my question s only when she was also in .
There f or e , she ho p ed that I could turn to other J a p an e se .
As a re s ul t , I w ro te a not e to her , apologize and made it clear t th at I did not mean to do that .
If she f el f hu r t , I would stop do ing it right away ! !
Even though her bo y f r in ed told me that he felt his girl f ri en d was too e m o tion al and that I could still con s ul t him question s when she was away , I de c line d his kind ness and almost never spoke to him .
O ri g in ally I thought that everything will just go back to normal , to the very begin n ing when I was in a good ter m with her .
However I was to t ally wrong because now she only ga ve my a co l d should er .
L a st time , I f u z z ed every time as speak ing more than usual .
S ound s ir on y , does n ; t it ?
What I mean is the more I study about express ion s or v o c a b ul ar ies , the more I ' m con f us ed , because every time I try to us e new things , it does n ' t come to my mind as a ut o m at ic ally as I wish , and it make s me m um m ur ing ( ? ) .
So I have a school tri p from 7 th to 9 th on s ept e m b er .
A l th ough I live in F u ku s h im a in J a p an , I ' ll go to Tokyo in J a p an .
So I need to be read y for school tri p soon .
So , I ' ll write about school tri p when I back home .
This le ad to no where .
I want to try myself in the ma ter i al world .
O ur turn is 1 4 : 2 5 .
I ' m going to my un ive r s ity , and start ing ch or p r a c t ic e from now on .
I live in the do r m with in ter n ation al st ud ent from the U .
She is very good at J a p an e se and always help me study English .
However , because of her good J a p an e se s k i ll , I some time s he s it ate to speak English .
M or e o ver , she always speak J a p an e se in s te ad of us ing English , so I do n ' t have enough ch ance to speak English .
There f or e , I try to de c id e `` O N L Y E N G L I S H D A Y `` and I as k her to speak only English d ur ing the day !
C ome back in time , if I could : (
A n n z u had been a str a y c at and pe c k ed by c r ow s in a p ar k , before a volunteer s a v ed her life .
When she came to my house for the first time , she was so s k in n y that we could n ' t hu g strong ly .
To day , I big in la ng - 8
I study English since I was j un i or high school st ud ent .
I can read w r ri ten paper in E m g l ish , for ex amp le new s paper s .
But I c a n ' t listen and write in English .
The class comp o se s of for st ud ent and teacher .
I have to speak w or d s many time s , so it is pro f it able .
G o s s i p G ir l is a pro p ul ar A m er ic a T V s er ies that was in t ro d u c ed to C h in a as fashion and life style b ook .
In the show s , S er an a and B la ir are the most l u c k girl who is ri ch and be at i ful , cha r m and so on .
They po s se s s all the thing which was most girl want to have in the world over all .
The people in the U p p er e a st live in go r g i ous and la v ish , but they are el ite who know how to man age a m ul t in ation al c or p or ation even though may b e in he ri ted from family .
O b v i ous ly , they are sp ot light in any part ies at N e w y or k night .
we are mo r t al , direct ly I en v y that kind of bu le b l o o d people .
Let me c ite a fashion al w or d `` hold `` which is f at a c y of a am a z ing girl in C h in a .
I want to N Y some day .
One of serious pro ble m s in J a p an .
I watch ed T V new s which is about high number s of s u ic id e d ur ing y on g er age from about 2 0 to 3 0 year s old people .
The new s told that the number s con t in u e to in c re a se over 1 0 year s .
E x a c t l ly I think that most y on g er people in J a p an have no dr e a m or p ur s po se to the future .
Then they feel themselves as us e less in the world , no reason to live any m or e .
A n y way , present time , we are much ri ch er ma ter i ally than past but our mind s got we a k en .
And J a p an e se so c i e ty is in a g ing so c i e ty and we run out of work for ce of y on g er people .
Some h ow we must stop you ng er people s u ic id e or our so c i e ty will co ll a p se very soon er than we expect ed .
I had been to O it a , my home town , for about three week s for s um m er va c ation , and I came back home three days before .
I felt a fresh a p p re c i ation of my p ar ent s this time because of going back my home town .
I also re al i z ed how I had ever been having l u x ur i ous life .
I did n ' t feel ing l on e ly before I went back to O it a , but still if I go back once , I will be a c c ust ome d to my original life that has any do g s , s is ter and p ar ent s , so when I was alone , I felt l on e ly very much .
But in fact , I ' m understand ing it is too bad for me because I ' ll go a b ro ad in A m er ic a for four year s as a un ive r s ity st ud d ent .
No body in my friend s live my house near b y , so when ever I go sh op p ing , I am alone .
It is only a matter of time to start my class , so I ' m look ing for w ar d to see ing my friend s now .
It happen d a f e w month s a g o .
That day , I was w at ing for a train at p l at f or m as us us al .
The woman , she seemed to be over 5 0 year s - old , came near
where I was stand because there was public p h on e near me .
She put money into p h on e then di al led .
`` O h , I ' m sorry I ' ll be l ate `` the woman talk ed with big voice that
she con t in u ed talk ing .
`` I was po o ing .
it was re ally big one so it took a long time to f l ash . ``
so I mi s s ed a train .
I ' m sorry I was here on time but it could n ' t be f l ash ed ``
She de s p er ate ly explain ed not her fault but her po o ' s fault .
Some time s people make an ex c us e for their mistake s such as t ar d y .
However , I have never heard such an ch il d ish ex c us e .
O th re w is e , any body be l ive her .
E ver y day , going to the comp an y , I watch ed the v id e o on the i P o d to u ch .
R e c ent ly It is `` the s es a m i street ``
It is for study ing English .
`` S es a m i street `` is f un for me .
But it E x c ite ment story tired me some time s .
The w or d E x c ite ment mean s `` H i - ten s y on ``
M a y b e it is wrong English .
`` s es a m i street `` is us e ful for study ing e ng l ish .
that `` less ex c ite ment `` e ng l ish study ing v id e o .
I had a dr e a m that I dr o ve a c ar and a c ar f e ll off from the ro ad .
I had lie down before I c he c k ed the e - ma il yesterday .
So , may b e I think I might have a all er g y to po ll en .
In sp r ing sea s on I become a dr y s k in and my eyes is very it ch y . . .

Tokyo p ow er comp an y had already stop p ed their s er v ic e in the s ch ed ul ed are a .
But they said p ow er still was not enough .
And I f il led p la st ic bo t t le s , p ot s and bu ke c t with water as much as possible .
We could n ' t us e water , if we had p ow er f a il ur e .

My ce ll p h on e has n ' t been work ing well .
I thought my ce ll p h on e at last b ro ke down serious ly because even when I p re s s ed the but t on s , it did n ' t re a c t at all .
On being in the sit u ation , I was almost los ing my comp o s ur e .
No soon er than had I not ic ed that than I went to my friend ' s room who se ce ll p h on e is the same ty pe as mi ne .
He was study ing , but I b ro ke in because I did n ' t a f f or d to care for him .
He ga ve me some piece s of i nformation about the ce ll p h on e and suggest ed that I call the c ust ome r c ent er of the comp an y .
F in ish ed his story , I tri ed to call soon .
The moment I called to the c ust ome r c ent er , I not ic ed that I was us ing my ce ll p h on e and it was work ing as usual .
I think it is because of my a g ing .
E ver y time I ' m writing an es s a y , I us ed a l ot of the same tra n s i tion al w or d s .

A c t u ally , a live c ir c us was interest ing ,
My d aught er ' s pleasure was the be st for me on this show .
But if some on e as k me to go again , I w o n ' t go even I pay .
R e c ent ly I was a b it la z y . . .

in no c ent : He tri ed to pro ve his in no c ence , but no one did n ' t believe what he said .
s es it ive : She said her s k in is sen s it ive to every st im ul i so she does n ' t w an n a go on a hi ke .
serious : I thought she was j o k ing , but when I looked at her face , it was quite serious so I re al i z ed she was saying the tru th .
no ble : I think every person need something no ble in their life .

I wonder if the us age of `` serious `` a b o ve is c or re c t .
T h an k you for always writing commen t .
I ' m ha p p y and it is st ud i ed .

In the sp r ing b re a k , I went to be d around 3 a .

The new se m est er will start from next week and some class will begin at 1 1 a . m .
It ' s a sh ame to let them just pass for la z y sleep ing .
So I w a ke up at 8 a .
It ' s not easy for me to w a ke up e al ry and some time s I feel an ir re st it i ble ur g e to sleep in day time , but still I man age to get out of be d at least 8 a .
I have an a p po in t ment to me e t my bo s s in the new work p la ce tomorrow a b it l ate night .

That includ ed electronic di ction ar y that I b or r ow ed from her long time a g o .
I had for g ot ten to return but she s ud d en ly called me and asked to return .
So I found in my desk and she sen t it with some so u ve n ir .
I called my mo m and let her know it was sen t from my w if e this morning .
A fter I finish ed my work , I me t a friend who is me m b er of same English c ir c le .
She has a l ot of D V D s which was co un ted over 2 0 0 !
I in t ro d u c ed the L an g - 8 to her .
I said it was good for study .
Then we went for dr in k a little and had a good time to talk .
She said she want ed to begin study ing English ra d i o pro g r a m .
So we will study the same pro g r a m and c he c k what we le ar n every week .
No soon er did I come back home by b ic y c le than did the ra in f a ll .
Yes ter day I b ough t a great de al of ri p en to m at o es .
I should or , act u ally , I have to study hard this week - end , but you know , there ' s always some stuff that catch my at ten tion more than study ing .
What is H a p p i ness ? P ar t 2
While I was listen ing to her story , I was look ing at my dinner that already became co l d .
B o th we were n ' t eat ing .
She some time s show ed me her tea r s and s i g h ed .
A c t u ally I had no idea to en c o ur age her , so I de c id ed to become a good listen er .
However , I listen ed to her story s il ent ly .
A ll I could do was to gr i p her hand s .
To tell you to the tru th , I re ally want ed to hu g her , but I could n ' t because I did n ' t want to surprise her .
H u g g ing is n ' t a part of J a p an e se c ul ture .
That ' s life .
It become s c he a p er comp ar ed with before .
T h ough the or i g in of go l f is un c le ar , it see m s that she p h er d s knock ed stone s into ra b b it ho le s is an est a b l ish ed the or y .
If it has been re m a in ing , the co st is nothing , right ?
A n y way , I want to see T i g er play go l f great ly .
It is hard ra in to day .
In J a p an , a l ot of ty p h o on come in S ept e m b er .
I am w or ri ed about the way home .
P ro b ably the train will stop .
My in ter p re ter ' s class was so t ough for me at last less on .
The them e was `` A bout so c i al part ic i p ation in J a p an . ``
One of my class m ate present ed that J a p an e se n ation is str a g g ling and f a c ing l ow e c on o m ical also po l it ical .
F or the past twenty year s , E s pe c i ally middle - a g ed me n has much a b il it ies and p ow er ful l .
They could con t ro led all over the J a p an .
However they do n ' t have enough a b il it ies and display now .
So we need get second w in d .
In the future more people who are w ome n , no n - re s id ence and you th would be part ic i p ate in any so c i al mo ve ment s .
It ' ll be better than now .
That them e was felt a b st r a c t for me .
I thought she should have present more de ta il conc re te .
We are , natural ly , always look ing for the be st me th o d , the f a st est way , the e as ies t p at ch to m aster ing English , J a p an e se , S p an ish , what ever ish . . .
On the other hand , good me th o d s [ As s im il ? ] when wrong ly us ed can pro d u ce poor re s ul t s .
In the end , what you should know , what you should [ at least you should . . . ] not ic e by your s el f is that there is n ' t A M E T H O D for language le ar n ing .
E a ch st ud ent have to find his own me th o d , his own way of le ar n ing .
O f course this is n ' t an easy thing to do .
I know some things work and some do n ' t , but to find out ex a c t ly how do it is n ' t that easy .
A ll me th o d s have good and bad point s , so what you have to do is not ic e the good point s and us e it in your way .
O f course I ' m being a b it s ta g y , but I just want to show that there is n ' t one me th o d that r ul es over all other s .
If you work - hard on it , you probab ly will not only find out what le ar n ing me th o d s and str ate g ies s u it you better , but you also will start to not ic e some un ive r s al p r in c i p le s about language le ar n ing .
The a ver age language le ar n er , who usual ly follow s just one me th o d s ( like many English teacher here in B r a z il who have le ar n ed English us ing the same me th o d for more than 2 0 year s ) , will probab ly not le ar n the se p r in c i p le s and , there f or e , become kind of limit ed when it come s to how to le ar n a language .
We had a very good time play ing cha s ing game in the water .
I ' m very ha p p y to see t at my d aught er started to have more con f id ent in the water because she could n ' t put her face in the water before she go es to s w im m ing less on s .
She was even s c ar e of get ting a b it of sp l ash on her face when she had a show er .
No w she can head - stand in the water !
As her school will have a s w im m ing less on start ing soon , ho pe ful ly she has no pro ble m in the water and can enjoy s w im m ing with other s .
I can tell the ch l or in e in the po o l was very strong since even though a b it of sp l ash of the water hu r t s my eyes quite a b it .
In addition to that , I felt re ally tired after get ting out of the water al th ough I had n ' t s w im much .
It has been already D e ce m b er .

You go , and there is not the los s .

I want to know English w or d s , and I look w or d s up with di ction ar y .
I do n ' t know many English w or d s and gra m m ar s and id i o m s and c ul ture and b l ur b l ur , , , , , I had no ch o ic e but to study English every day .
That ' s why I have to go to C an ad a , I want to go there ! ! !

But I ' m J a p an e se , so My think ing things are in J a p an e se x ( I want to think things in English .

And , I also stop p ed by a s up er e m ar ke t near my house to bu y something to get a b ite .
When I went back home , I left things I b ough t at the dr u g st or e over there and for g ot about it !
I found it 2 h r s la ter , so I r us h ed to the s up er m ar ke t and asked the c ash i er where it is .
F or t un ate ly , He kept them , and I could find them .
P le a se ex p l an the follow ing set ence s .
P ro b ably right before she los t it .
How do you f it into this who le thing ?

It is difficult for me to speak and write with English .
And let ' s tell own language each other ! !
My think ing was brought to a stand st i ll .
I have no idea for that .
So , it is nothing and nothing again .
Where does my in s p ir ation go ?
I tra v ed with my class 3 days a g o .
A l th ough we were tired but every body felt please d .
We took many p h ot o , about 7 0 0 picture s .

But each case , they help each other to over c ome those .
In this s er ies , the re l ation s h i p with ho r se s is n ' t so ma in to p ic of the story , comp ar ing with He ar t l and S er ies .

But in fact , I understood that in M ar ch I have to take or al ex a m in ation about my the s is .

This is my first time to write an ar t ic le us ing English !

I need friend , and need con t ent with person s , however , the people do n ' t like me , I think so .
who can help me or tell me what could I do ?
My an x i ous
He had s m o k ed with his friend s se c re t ly .
H is class teacher came to my house .
He told me what had happen ed unti l now .
This is the first time that I have heard their circumstance s .
I thought that my so n want ed to es c a pe from being for c ed
I re f le c ted on myself a l ot and I said to him .
`` You do not have to study so much , so that you should stay home any way . ``
I have heard the sound of walk ing on the ro o f .
One day the voice has been heard out of his room , so I tri ed to open the do or of his room .
Then , I saw two bo y s who hi d behind the bu n k be d .
I per s u ad ed them about a f e w things .
I am sorry that you do not keep the pro m is es with me about stop p ing s m o k ing and study ing hard er .
How should I do ?
This is my first try to this sit e .
So I would like to co m m un ic ate who ever want s to .
I ten d to be l ive in g h o st because I was b or n in small town .
The p op ul ation of my two n was l ow .
My ne i g h b or ' s house was old so it is easily b ro k en if the ty po on come in our re g in .
B e f or e I tri ed to sleep at n i g th t I always went to re st ro o m and I can see their house .
I c a n ' t do anything because I was k i z s .
I called my mo m : He y I found a c ock ro a ch so please k i ll them .
co m on mo m !
hu r ry up !
I of ten us e something like that .
My high school ( 4 )
They th ri ll ed me near ly through o ut the school year of G r ad e T w o .
O f course , I was w or ri ed about that my be ha v i or was found as I was enjoy ing them .
My be ha v i or was found at last .
I was s us p en d ed to make a s el f - ex a m in ation .
A t begin n ing , though , I found that I could not catch up with my less on s , for I had mi s s ed so many less on s .
In this way , it took me four year s to finish the three - year j un i or high school .
She like d a new ho s o it al because do c ter explain ed her well .
It ' s very easy le ve l .
I heard it ' s good to read many b ook s in s u it able le ve l .
No w , the number of w or d s I read is 2 666 w or d s .
i P o d n an o the 5 th g en er ation
I b ough t an i P o d n an o the 5 th g en er ation last D e ce m b er .
So it is not easy for me to us e M a c style .
I can im p or t m us ic into i P o d n an o but c a n ' t understand the way about any picture s .
F in ally , to day , I found out how to im p or t some picture s into i P o d n an o !
I am very ha p p y for do ing that .
I had a very bu s y day to day , because I had two class es , c he c k ed students ' not e b ook s , there was a b is i ness tri p .
I was going to go to con ver s ation al English class , but English teacher c aught a co l d yesterday , so to day ' s less on was c ance led .
I went to the M e x ic an re st a ur ant `` E l To ri t o `` to night and at e E n ch il ad a , S al s a ch i p s , C e as er s ar ad a , and ic e c re a m and dr un k M ar g ar it a which was f ro z en with s al t f r ing e around the g la s s .
I like M ar g ar it a very much , but it s al c o h o l le ve l is kind of high , so I ' m always get ting sleep y after dr in k ing .
There are many t v s c re en s ha ng ing on the wall and the t v cha n n el is always sp or t s cha n n el `` E S P N . `` To day ' s sp or t s was b a se b a ll .
f o ot b a ll sea s on will start on A u g ust . . . . .
so now what we can watch is b a se b a ll game s and ho c ke y game s .
To day is the G u y F a w ke s N i g h t ( or bo n f i re night ) in O x f or d .
A l th ough it is off ic i ally the f if th of No ve m b er , the even t is set to S at ur day night this year .
L a st year my w if e and I went to the bo n f i re he l d at the So u th P ar k .
A l th ough it was a ch il ling night , the large p ar k was full of c r ow d s .

The f a il ed as s as s in ation attempt is now called as the g un p ow d er p l ot .
F or some reason , the B ri t ish have been ce le b r at ing this day with bo n f i re and f i re w or k s for more than 4 0 0 year s .
I ' m not even sure that the B ri t ish are either in f a v o ur of or against G u y F a w ke s himself and his p l ot .
In my opinion , most of them may be tak ing a d v ant age of his f a il ed attempt to enjoy f i re w or k s with a good reason .
F or me as a J a p an e se , f i re w or k s on a co l d a ut um n night are very un us u al and even s ur re al ex pe ri ence , since f i re w or k s are ic on s of the hot t est s um m er sea s on in J a p an , re m in d ing me the hu m id and hot a ir , girl s we ar ing y u k at a ( by the way , girl s with y u k at a look 3 0 % more at t r a c t ive and p re t t i er then usual ) , k a k i g or i ( c r us h ed ic e with f r u it - f la v o ur ed s y r up ) , and so on .
When a B ri t ish `` guy `` visit s J a p an and see s f i re w or k s f est i v al s in s um m er , what so r t of e m o tion s would he re g is ter ?
D r ow s i ness

We can be for g ive n to s a c ri f ic e some on e for s a ve the world ?
I had no time to write the L an g - 8 .

It was so hot d ur ing the day , so I want ed to go to a re st a ur ant in which a ir condition er works .
When we stand ed in front of the do or of that re st a ur ant , we found the do or open ed .

D u e to hot at m o s p he re I could dr in k much be er .

or when you give a g if t ?
I write a di ar y on L an g - 8 in English at the first time .
So , I try to write di ar ies to le ar n how to us e English .

G ow ever , I at e too much , so I have a st o m a ch ?

In the se month s , I ha v n ' t been a di l i g ent st ud ent .

I ' m bu s y now .
A fter school start , I do n ' t have much time to do something I want to do .
A ll thing I have is study , study and study .
We are c r a z y now .
O ur teachers are funny , and I j o in a mo d er n dr a m a c l u b .
It ' s funny and ex cited .
In my new life , it ' s full of ha p p y and f un .
T h ro u th , it is a l ot of p re s s ur e .
So , I need to study hard now .
I b ough t some st ock s in last O c t .
S in ce then , I ' ve been interest ed in e c on o m ic s so much .
The e c on o m ic s in J a p an is easy to be affect e ed by that of for e i g n country ( es pe c i ally U S ) .
O f course not only J a p an , many co un t ri es ' e c on o m ic s is affect ed by other co un t ri es ' it .
No w , in my country , many people were f ir ed their job s , and what is w or se , it ' s difficult for any people to find new job .
There ' re many bad new s in this way now . . .
However , do n ' t you think it ' s interest ing that the re l ation s h i p of e c on o m ic s between a country and another country ?
I think it ' s still too e ar ly for me to talk about e c on o m ic s in e ng l ish .
S in ce I ' d like to know about the se place s as much as possible , I am read ing g u id e b ook s and c he c k ing the in ter ne t every d s a y .
I H a ve A w ar e
R e c ent ly , I ' ve a w ar e of it ' s not easy to e ar n money .
We never e ar n money at the time of do ing .
M a y b e there are some works that can get l ot s of money a day .
But I do n ' t think they are a b s o l ut e ly good works .
H a ve a no ce day ! !
it is a n ic e we a ther to day !
I like d such as day .
I had a only class in man age ment to day . it was b or ing ,
it mean t that f in al - ex a m is coming soon .
may b e I go n n a be c r a z y . . . . .
but I am not in mo o d to study . . . . I am la z y . . . . . .
by the way I am about to leave for my home
to day my co ll e age will hold even t ! I think it will be f un !
this even t hold in once a year .
I could me e t a l ot friend s ! I am very ex c i ed !
the story still con t in un e to . . . . . . . .
I co ock ed two ha m b er g er dis he s yesterday .
I was going to play ten n is the after no on .
But what make s the se two v id e o s to t ally different .
When it sh in es , I will hold your hand s and to g e ther we will walk along the street s
To day I ' d like to talk a story about a dr un k who los t his ke y s .
It ' s f a m ous j o ke , so may b e you have heard .
I think it is a simple story but can tea ch us im p or t ant less on about our life .
One night , a man go es out dr in k ing at a l o c al b ar .
A fter saying good b y e to his friend s , he begin s walk ing home , s ing ing ha p p i ly to himself .
As he near s his a p ar t ment , he take s his ke y s out of his pocket but dr op s them on the gr ound in the dark .
On re al i z ing his ke y s are mi s s ing , he w and er s over to a near b y street l amp and begin s look ing for them there .
I had a trouble with my English .
T h ough I le ar n ed English for a long time .
I knew my pro ble m was that I c ound ' t catch the mean s what people said , and my pro n un c i ation was too bad .
I want ed to be able to m aster English con ver s ation , but I sp ent my much time study ing gra m m ar , even I tri ed to read new s p a p er and no ve l s .
A ll study is help ful , but it is n ' t effect ive .
It is im p or t ant for me to know what I want and f o c us on that .
J a p an e se come d i an s some time s p ar o d y for e i g n er ' s J a p an e se speak ing s .
The f e a ture s are o m it ting part ic le s , wrong a c c ent s and into n ation s and it see m s that they can be c ate g or is ed by n ation al it ies .
I suppose this may be tru e from my ex pe ri ence s and a c ut u ally English ch il d re n le ar n n ur se ry r h y m e in a language a c qu is i tion .
O ther w is e , if J a p an e se le ar n er s mi m ic ed their r h y th m even if it was strange J a p an e se , they might o b tain a s k i ll to speak natural ly .
J un z o Ka w ad a is a re se ar ch er in c ul t ur al an th ro po l o g y and he went to A f ri c a to re se ar ch a tri b e that do not have letter s .
He c la m ed that they have im a g in ation in their mind s and they con ve y them to the dr um .
When I listen ed to this story , I thought this is like ty p ing a ke y b o ar d .
And there are a c ut u ally some r h y th m p at ter n s when I hi t the ke y b o ar d .
It take s about a mi n u e t to the st ation .
I ' m going to co m m ut e my office which is in L i u J i a Z u i by sub way .
I have to transfer to the line two at the J ing A n S i .
