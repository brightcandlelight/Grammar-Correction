So I went to a cellphone shop and I questioned why it restarted by itself every time .
The assistant said without feeling that he did n't know the reason and it needed to be repaired at the head office .
Also he mentioned that it might have cost a charge .
Then , I totally get mad and said , `` Huh !
What do you mean you did n't know at all ? ?
You mean although I buy broken thing , I have to spend money for this ?
I ca n't understand . I do n't understand .
Forget it ! Forget about it !
You good for nothing ! ``
In the end , this problem has n't been fixed yet . . .
and I need to be a lady .
I have found a good English Studying web site .
because they cost too much money .
I have read some articles saying that some English classes do n't teach good english , or that some students do n't make any sense of it , or that it does n't fit their english level .
I might be a lucky girl because I can understand English even though I do n't take any lessons .
But my English level is intermediate .
My english is good enough to converse with native speakers .
I am glad I speak English and can converse with native people .
I 'm not great at speaking English but I can get along with native people .
I am happy that I can make friends with native people
If you come to Japan and speak a little Japanese , you will be praised for speaking Japanese , even if the sentence you speak is very short .
That 's because Japanese people think the Japanese language is one of the most difficult languages in the world .
They have pride in their own language .
However , in my opinion , Japanese is n't the most difficult language compared to other languages .
There are two reasons why .
Japanese has fewer vowels and consonants than English .
He wanted to say he was in the middle of the campaign and said loudly , `` I have an erection now ! ``
The hardest ones to distinguish are `` hurt `` from `` heart `` and `` fast `` from `` first `` .
It sounds absolutely the same to Japanese .
Japanese pronunciation is easier than other Asian languages as well .
It has a much more complex sound than Japanese .
It does n't have male or female verbs like French , Spanish and Russian do .
There are no singular forms and plural forms .
No articles are needed .
There are fewer patterns of conjugation .
These are the two reasons why I believe Japanese is not difficult .
I believe the most difficult thing in learning Japanese is writing it because most people are n't used to its letters .
But you should n't hesitate to start learning Japanese .
I brought my dog to get trimmed yesterday .
The first photo is before , others are after .
I think everybody has similar minds and similar potential .
Here is my question :
Maybe there is some research on why people fail when they try to learn language ?
Yesterday , my school had a hat day .
If we wanted to wear our hats , we had to pay $ 2 .
The money is then contributed .
But I did n't wear my hat because I forgot on the day ^ ^
Listening to English programs , studying English magazines , etc .
We have to study English now , or we wo n't pass an important test in three years .
There is going to be a Japanese school visiting our school .
And I going to receive one of the students .
We will have eight Japanese students in each class .
We will have a lesson with them .
And we will teach Taiwanese history about Japanese aggression against Taiwan .
We all laughed when our history teacher told us that .
Maybe we will say something about their contribution after the Japanese were aggressive towards us .
We will do a lot of activities when the Japanese students come .
I went to Okinawa the southern part of Japan as a school event this week .
We were there for four days . The first three days were rainy and cloudy , so I did n't feel I was in southern island .
Also , the hotel we stayed the last day was in the center of Naha City , the capital city of Okinawa , so it made me feel like I was in Tokyo .
But it was the last big event in my high - school life , so I enjoyed spending time with my friends there and visiting many places .
We enjoyed water activities in the beautiful ocean and visited an aquareum , a museum and other things .
Everything went well without any trouble and the trip made me realize an important thing . So I think it was nice to experience it .
I have been quite busy the last couple of days because of my exams at the university .
I 'm a student at the Silesian University of Technology in the Environmental Engineering department .
I enjoy my classes a lot and I know I will miss them when I graduate .
I have one exam left and when I pass it , I 'm going to have some time off .
My dad and I are going to France to go skiing .
I ca n't wait ! : ) When we come back I will have to start working on my thesis , which is about ventilation and heating in passive houses .
My main task is to make a project of it and to make a cost - effectiveness analysis .
I remember the day ( when ) I first watched Terminator 2 .
It was a really exciting film with two cyborg guys called terminators chasing and fighting each other .
But it made me wonder how soon we would see a society where such cyborgs or humanoid robots are living with us .
Although it will take time before we can actually create such sophisticated cyborgs , we may soon be able to have a simpler humanoid robot which can help us in our daily lives .
So if you want one of the robots to move its right arm , for example , all you need to do is just think about it in your head .
That is awesome .
I 'm a little concerned that this kind of technology will be used for military purposes ( as you can see in the movie ) .
I know , for better or worse , technological developments always go hand in hand with military activities .
By the way , I think the movie has a sequel .
After I came back home , I put on the same - color upper to match with it and I was satisfied with how it looked .
I lost my hat last saturday .
I got an e - mail saying that it was found .
It 's really cool to meet a lot of foreign friends here .
Many lovely people are giving me courage and corrections . Even though my Eng .
Even though my English is a big disaster , you guys * still correct my mistake patiently .
I have had itchy eyes all day .
My friends said that you should n't scratch your eyes .
That would make it worse .
I thought about what could have caused this .
I registered on this site today .
That means the weekend is just around the corner .
This weekend , my family will be holding a party to celebrate my dad 's birthday . y
I am not decided yet but must at least plan for it this afternoon .
I am thinking about sports wear to buy for him to encourage him to work out .
She will stay for 4 days .
I ca n't wait for her to come / get here .
Anyway , I have a plan to go to Kyoto or Nara .
What do you think ?
Will she like it ?
I do n't know what kind of food she likes .
You can park your car beside the hotel .
You can not park your car in front because it 's a no parking zone .
As soon as I started writing , I received some comments .
So I 'd like to continue my diary .
My dog `` Fal `` , who is Italian gray hound , does n't like
to stay at home alone .
After only a few hours , he misses me .
But a dogs life is n't so long , so I 'm going to stay with him
as long as I possibly can .
This is my first time to write a diary in an English ,
so some of my English grammars are n't polished yet .
I hope you can correct some of its errors .
Today is my birthday . : )
I had my haircut and my black hair was dyed dark brown .
It was a great birthday !
But when I left my home , I knew I would be late .
The bus that I wanted to get on was was late too .
As a result I was able to get on the bus , and I was just in time for the job .
About Kittens .
I 'm staying at my friends house now .
I think being cute is stronger than anything now .
If now was the ancient age , they would be killed or eaten immediately by a snake or something , but now is the modern era .
The snake is picked out from its position by much a stronger animal , the human being .
So , kittens got much more power with their cuteness .
The kittens ' perfect cuteness is much more powerful than the incomplete power of snakes now .
Many people gathered there to practise their tennis .
After practicing , me and ( my friend ? ) Asano were matched against a strong pair .
To tell the truth , they were n't that strong , but we lost anyway .
Asano was in bad condition today .
I realized when my partner was in bad condition that all you need is teamwork .
I think many people have new year 's goals . So do I .
My new year 's goal is to pass Japanese 2level and improve my english .
Since I 've started working , my interest in studying is less than before , when I was in college .
But I found if you do not study , your brain may become more and more unintelligent .
So I suppose that we must study only if we have time .
I think people should n't be able to choose when they want to die ,
since it is also murder .
Some people say it not only helps to end their pain but also it helps to solve their family 's economic problems .
They have a right which is to live a quiet life for the rest of their days .
This is a blessing .
If they had committed a crime , they could atone .
I have n't been much of a history buff myself ,
therefore I do n't know the details of ancient civilizations .
I think they are still relevant today because history has a way of repeating itself .
That way , they can feel familiar with ancient history .
I think that when you study history , it 's good idea to try to seek what history has in common with our society now .
Good - bye , 2009 !
I have lived in NY since September , coming from Japan . And I am now discovering and wondering at new things I learn about the US , and writing about my questions or comments .
the other day I was shocked with the dispute on a TV show .
she reported that her kid seemingly behaved strangely . So when she asked what was wrong with her , she confessed their father , I mean her husband abused the daughter .
the conclusion was , that she lied because she wanted to get back custody of her first daughter who now lives with her ex husband .
the reason that she was deprived of her custody of their first child , was she overdosed on cocaine ( I forgot why she had it at the time )
I thought Court TV shows dealt with easy cases , but I do n't know what is easy and what is serious in the US .
about the rest of my UK life
Today is the second day of May .
Four months have passed since new years day and this means that my visa expires within ten monthes .
Recently , I have been thinking how to spend the rest of my time in this country .
I left London at the beggining of March and I 've been working on the farm for two months .
I can say that my life on the farm has been better than what I imagined before I started it . [ more natural ]
But , honestly , I am feeling a little bit tired because of having done physical works for two months .
Fortunately , I have some things to do in London at the end of this month .
So it must be a good chance for me to take a rest and decide what to do after that .
I have n't decided yet , but , after taking a rest , I would like to start working on the farm again and keep doing it as long as possible .
This morning while I was sleeping someone sent a message to me and said `` Wake up , wake up Noy `` or something like that . She is my sister who lives so far from me , but we are close in our hearts .
About 5 seconds later she called me again to say good morning . I did not answer because we know if she calls me it means she would like to say good morning or good night .
She got disconnected from Skype yesterday while me and Tyler were talking because it is a bad connection from her country .
Before she left she did not say something to me as she usually does because she was suddenly gone .
I will ask her for a hug another day when I see her again .
And I want to say something to her . I am sorry I have no money to send her back a message . Poor Noy .
I also listened to a very good song from Tyler yesterday .
He ca n't sing but he can hum and dance and and play the guitar .
From today , I will try to write a diary in English .
This nickname comes from GHIBLI 's character .
I like this GHIBLI 's movies , like `` Tonarino totoro `` and `` Mazyono Takkyubin `` .
Next , I live in Kanagawa , Japan .
But , I lived in Fukuoka until this March .
So now , I search good places like cafe , park , restaurant and so on .
Recently , I found a good cafe ! !
My recommended movie ( or I recommend the movie ) is `` The Tiger and The Snow `` .
I will !
If I 'm a Pitcher . . .
For a long time , I went to Song gang Dong field in order to play a baseball game in early morning .
Then , I tried to go there , and also It was difficult to drive my car because I met a friend who lives in Seoul yesterday .
Today was a very hot day .
We played The Institute of National Security Science at 11pm .
I 'm a pitcher and the 5th hitter .
I 'm a bad baseball player but I exercise hard during the later winter .
Our game started at 12 : 00 and I was so nervous .
My beseball career is shorter than everyone 's but I have good physical abilities like fast feet , strong shoulders , and endurance for any pain .
I also enthusiastically do everything not to lose . .
Chinese Calligraphy and Traditional Chinese Painting !
Hi , ( my ) foreign friends , especially those of you who are interested in Chinese culture . I want to tell you about two important parts of Chinese culture today !
Chinese calligraphy , which is has been practiced for at least 3000 years , is a brilliant traditional art .
I have taught myself how to write calligraphy and wrote the example in my album ( * _ * ) .
Chinese painting , the traditional art , is painted by writing brushes that are also used in calligraphy !
I also drew the picture in my album myself
Chinese calligraphy and traditional Chinese painting both
So this article must be wrong in many places , thanks for your corrections and advice ! )
I went back home ! !
I took a Monorail .
My house is convenient .
Because it is near the station .
I have no religion , but the class is held for anyone who is interested in it .
Although I 'm not that school student , they welcome me , so this is really good opportunity to learn English and the Bible .
Since our regular teacher has to work another temporary job for 6 weeks , my American friend who used to a student of the class substitutes for our teacher for the time being .
I have come to feel closer to her than before .
This year I 've started to study ballet . It 's known that you only can learn to dance ballet when you are a child , or at least that was I always thought , but I was lucky to have the chance .
It was embarrassing at first because I was the oldest girl there , but with time I 've learned to enjoy it ^ ^
Our teacher always says `` I will never allow my students to be less than me . You have to become at least as good as me . ``
This month he wants our us to debut as a ballet company , not only as a academy , so we are doing to do a show with other academies from Peru , Chile and Argentina .
We are doing `` Coppelia `` , even though we are not professional dancers . We are adding a little bit of fun to the original play and it is going it great .
Is It Good to be Persuasive ?
In my culture , people are not always aggressive and we are always thinking about others , as much as , or indeed more than ourselves . [ 1 ]
Since I am not from the States , I am not sure about the culture here .
As far as I have heard and experienced , the culture here is that people care about themselves more than others . They are more self - centered , which I do n't mean in a good nor bad way .
Since culture is very important in everyday life ,
how we should act depends on the culture or norm in the place we live .
For example , in my country , the distance between people is less , so everything can be flexible and it depends on the relationship between the people involved .
However , in the United States , regulations and laws come first .
Therefore , I always think before I act because I am not sure what the correct way to act is .
For example , I have a question : if someone refuses your proposal , is it ok to be persuasive and ask the person again ?
Today , I went to watch a movie .
The title is `` Eat Play Love `` . Julia Roberts is acting in this film .
My friend said this movie is not so good judging by a website survey , but I do n't agree .
It was a good movie .
The main character traveled to Italy , India and Bali .
She met many people and found herself .
She performed meditation in India .
It seems hard but I think it 's a good way to see myself deeply .
If I have a problem , I want to try meditating .
Moreover , when I saw the scene in Italy , it made me want to go to Italy .
Actually , I have been there . I ate pasta and pizza .
The pizza I ate in Italy was the best I have ever had .
I want to eat it again .
It has been 3 months since I came here .
I was supposed to give lectures right after moving to this city , but fortunately at that time it was a vacation .
At first , I enjoyed my free time .
I realized that doing nothing makes my body and soul tired
The most difficult thing in someone 's life might be to find clothes that fit perfectly , I think .
Where are my clothes is waiting for me ?
Are there any clothes that fit me . . ?
( But . . .
Actually I bought 3 shirts and 1 pair of pants .
That 's it . )
If I find something that looks good on me , I should put it down first .
Do I really want this ?
Next , If the clothes are really good on me , I should think again . Is this really necessary ? ?
I bought one pair of pants a few months ago .
The pants are in hip - hop style .
It does n't fit my body . It makes me look like a dwarf .
It was an impulse buy .
So , I decided , when I buy any clothes , I 'll follow that step ! !
If your friend tells you to buy something , Say `` Let me sleep on it `` .
Studio Ghibli was established by Miyazaki in 1985 .
Studio Ghibli has to continue living as a company , so , it has to cultivate new talent in animation films .
The producer ( first name ) Suzuki is virtually the CEO of Studio Ghibli , tried to foster new human resources again and again , but Miyazaki always pressured young animators .
Young creators were bursting from pressure by Miyazaki .
Many people criticized ? the film , and Miyzaki was one of them .
I like to live here but a it 's little inconvenient .
Because I have to go to Seoul everyday . It 's too far from Ilsan .
It 's a very busy life .
I miss my old house a little .
Hi guys , it 's a been long time since I wrote a diary last time .
I liked to draw pictures when I was an elementary schooler , and now , I like using Photoshop .
It took 30 min from my flat by bike , so I did n't go there after a while . .
Haha , now I 'm bragging about it .
But still I ca n't draw a pic using Photoshop and I still do n't have any confidence about it .
Actually , I used software on the web to process the picture .
The big boy ( ? ) on this pic is the original picture .
This is sort of a festival poster .
One of my friends managed this festival through his club .
He dragged in various kinds of people .
In addition , he asked a company to be a sponsor , and got some money .
My goal is to make good posters and works without some software ( except , besides ) Photoshop .
What 's your hobby ?
Sorry I did n't use a dictionary a lot this time , so there is probably a lot of mistakes . . . > <
Today was a lazy day . . .
I have n't been to the swimming pool ( lately ) , and my swimming skills are in a poor condition . I must do something about it .
Today is a very warm and fine day .
But these fine days wo n't last much longer .
I 'm watching a TV program called `` PU - SSUMA `` now . It 's a very popular program .
In JAPAN , we have many casual ( family ) restaurants of various countries ' food .
It 's a very funny project .
Last Sunday , I bought a coffee maker at YODOBASHI camera in Akiba .
I 'm from Vietnam and I want to learn Korean and English with you guys !
Not eating good food made me feel bad while I was working .
I really realized that a proper meal was important for my health .
I watched Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince . [ titles are capitalized ]
Disappointed !
I come to this site everyday to find if anyone has looked at my journal and sent me messages .
I said to myself if you do n't write nobody will come your page to help you correct your mistakes .
Friends , no matter what countries you come from and what languages you want to learn , I think we can become friends , not only for the reason of `` learning languages `` .
Does it mean literally `` go out of the hospital `` ?
Or does it mean `` go out with their boyfriends or girlfriends `` ?
Do these two sentences mean exactly the same thing ? [ Yes . ]
The Rapper Well - known By The Japanese
Maybe it is only the young people know about Eminem .
The other artists are probably not known by Japanese people .
Maybe the Japanese people like rap or R & B would know the other rappers .
Why Eminem is known by the Japanes people is because he was acting the movie , 8 miles .
From then I have liked him .
Before he acted in the movie I liked his songs .
He had sold fun rap music in those days .
There was a lot of rap music but there was n't one such as Eminem .
Since I started working at the University , I often remember my high school days .
I had some good friends and we laughed a lot everyday .
We talked about people we were interested in , teachers , baseball games , music , motorcycles , our part - time jobs and our dreams . . !
Those were pretty good days for us .
But we probably should have studied more . .
When we graduated from ( our ) high school , my friends gave me a great prize .
That was `` the funniest of the class `` prize !
But my friend got the prettiest girl prize , another friend got the smartest prize . . . .
it 's okay .
Anyway , I was of the top students in my class . . . !
Actually , I still like making people laugh .
One of my friends is a physician , one lives in France , and another is a stay - at - home mother right now .
We have n't seen each other for a long time , so I 'd like to meet them someday .
Today I have only Russian and Latin languages at the university .
Tomorrow we 'll have a test in our English lesson .
Also , we need to make a project about famous people or the famous lawyers of our city .
I do n't even know what to write !
Also we have to about 200 new English words by heart .
Moreover , our library does n't want to give us our books .
But I hope it will get warmer .
I like rock music but I sometimes listen to jazz , electronic and pop ( ? ) music .
I want to listen to English songs to practice my English .
Now all students in Russia ( or are having ) exams .
It 's a hard time . . .
Now I write ( or am writing ) a course about fashion of the 70 's .
I like 70 's hippie ( fashions ) , punk & disco ( music ) , and the studio 54 ( nightclub ) .
I saw the film `` studio 54 `` , it was a crazy club .
There is a club called `` studio 74 `` in the city where I live , but it is n't like the one in New York haha
I do n't know what to write , I think my letter ( or is becoming ) boring
It 's been a big problem for me for a long time .
Today when I was studying English , I realized that I was n't eligible to become a teacher because I am not good at conversation .
I think I 'm not qualified to become a teacher unless I enjoy conversation .
If you do n't have communication skill , you should n't be teaching .
As I came to the above conclusion this afternoon , I went to a church where I hang out a lot .
There I decided to talk about what I have in mind more positively .
Next time , I 'm going to talk to a person who I am attracted to .
Introduce myself
Hello ! !
I recently graduated from college and I started to work for a company this spring .
I dream of studying abroad but I have poor English skills !
But now , I study economics more , since my job is deeply related with economics .
My favorite football team
I had done some writing on my blog for 9 days in a row .
I 'll start making a new record from today onward ! !
They are a Japanese professional football team .
I 'm an avid fan of them .
That makes me delighted , truly .
In fact , Jef is not a strong team , they are in second division of Japanese football league .
Originally , They were in the first division .
Last year , they were n't promoted to first division .
This year , the league has just started .
Actually the match wo n't be aired on TV .
so All I can do is to check the progress on the internet .
Today , I was sleepy in all my classes .
I was really excited yesterday , it must have made me tired .
Being in good condition is very important when taking a test .
The countries that I want to visit are Thailand , U .
That is too many countries but , I 'd like to visit those countriesT .
I want to experience the culture or festivals of other countries ( Halloween , Samba , Opera , etc . . . )
But , There are Korean festival that I have n't experienced .
Therefore , I want to experience Korea 's culture first .
I 'd like to experience the Mud Festival .
The Mud Festival is fun festival , where you apply mud all over your body
I 'm dying to go there .
Today , I 'm writing in my diary in my free time .
I am watching an English movie .
I want to get used to native speakers .
I am facked ( ? ? ? ) with a many difficult problems .
I 'll carry on studying and with my lifestyle .
I know that many people think that in Siberia it is winter all year round .
But Siberia is very , very big .
In most areas , summer occurs every year .
I once heard that in Siberia , bears walk on the towns ' streets .
And on New Years people catch all the bears in their town , harness them and ride on sledges all night .
There are bears of course .
They live deep in the forests and not in the cities .
I have lived in Siberia all my life and I have met bears only in the zoo .
Today , the morning was cool and the afternoon was warm .
For this reason , we have to be careful not to catch a cold .
I had some free time today since there were not many other people around .
I have studied dictation as well as reading in English .
Next week I will go to a language school to improve my speaking abilities .
This commercial was about the digitalization of TV .
This commercial said that just two months are left until the start of the digitalization .
I feel that it 's just around the corner .
Anyway , _ how about your country ?
Is TV digitalization common ?
English speakers use high frequency .
When English speakers speak English , they use very high tones compared to Japanese people .
Sometimes I am watching and listening to English artists ' music videos on You Tube , but even male artists ' tones are very high .
Some female English speakers especially are speaking English with very high tones .
It sounds very pretty to Japanese men .
It 's as if their voices are Japanese voice actors who are acting like a child .
I like Linkin Park .
I want to speak English as fluently as my mother tongue . . .
I ` m a 20 year old Japanese medical student
my hobby is Japanese martial arts .
So I want to have a skype friends whose mother tongue is English , and to make many friends who are overseas .
Please do n't hesitate to speak to me .
In the future , I will have to speak English fluently for my occupation .
I do n't have much time
I know that it 's time to study hard .
I hope time will go faster than now
I could swim 500 metres .
I was like a fish when I swam ! !
I have a long May weekend and I am trying to raise my English level .
I watched a BBS show ( of course in english ) and I listened to more Podcasts .
I still search for the best method of learning .
In the future I wo n't be able to get out of my country . . .
My friend let me borrow a very interesting English book .
It is about the U .
; ) I think that I have to search for a friend to converse with on skype or to help me with writing letters . Is anyone willing ? ( 9 .
Three days ago , my university friends and I ate kimuchipan .
We put in various kinds of food .
For example , Chinese cabbages , hackberrys , tofu , Japanese nikudangos , gyouzas and so on .
We put cheese on top .
It was more delicious .
I had never eaten it .
It was very very good !
Kyoto is a traditional Japanese city .
In Japan , it is autumn .
So the leaves have turned red .
We walked while looking at the colored leaves .
I could n't see kiyomizudera at night because we did n't have time .
If you have a chance to go to Kyouto , I recommend you go to `` kiyomizudera `` .
I was happy to have lived a full life in this week .
Yesterday , I was playing with my friends .
While eating dessert , we pondered what we should do afterwards .
The film 's title is ' Robin Hood ' .
The movie was very exciting and good .
We promised to meet after final exams .
What an interesting book ! !
These days I am reading the novel `` Master of the game `` written by Sidney Sheldon .
My friend recommended me that book and it 's so interesting that I ca n't stop reading it .
Actually , once I started to read , I could n't stop even if it was late in the evening !
So , I never start reading this book at night .
I am reading it in Japanese now , but after I finish reading , I would like to try
to read it in English .
In the novel , `` The son of Kate ( who is one of the main characters of the book ) , Tonny `` was
hospitalized for psychiatric reasons after his wife 's death .
Because his wife Marianne was dead .
It 's a tragedy .
I 'm wondering what will be in the end , and I 'm looking forward to knowing it .
I have been called to a company , GTN today for some reason .
GTN seems to help foreign people who would want to move to Japan to find an apartment .
Two months have passed and I still have not made any improvement on my oral english . . .
Up to now , I still have n't had any successful experiences with talking to a foreigner . It 's really a shame on myself . . .
My school started on Monday , so I have been a little bit busy in the week .
I really feel I already need a break , I know the winter break has just finished though ~ haha .
My friend and I had nothing to do because we were crazy about shopping .
But we went to Penn state university which is a very huge university .
I met some school security guys and they asked us , `` Are you guys coming here to apply for college - entry exams ? `` , but we were just tourists so we said that we did n't have anything to do , so we came here ~ haha . ``
I personally think nobody wants to visit or apply for college - entry exams on Christmas day ~ Christmas is a special holiday for many people , right ?
I want to go to Penn state again because we visited some historical museum but they were closed so we just took some pictures of them .
Today , my roommate woke me up early in the morning because she thought I was oversleeping .
I have been living in Hanoi for 5 months .
When I arrived in Vietnam 5 months ago , it was summer .
But now , it is winter in Vietnam .
Many things happen here .
Blackouts , floods , strong sunshine and very very hot days .
The time is passing by quickly .
Vietnam also has winter .
Sometimes I draw about my dream 's beautiful life on the white snow while looking at the snow .
but I have not seen snow any where in Vietnam .
Snow never falls in Vietnam .
I 'll study English by lang - 8 from now on !
Because I want to learn writing and speaking in English .
However I have snow at my university town today .
Recently , we had strange weather more and more .
When people are going to celebrate a special event such as graduation or a special party , some of them prefer a large party , while some of them prefer a small party with a few close friends and family members . Which do you prefer ?
When it comes to whether we should ask as many people as possible to attend our grand celebrations , this issue is always very thought - provoking and worthy of serious deliberations .
Some people love to invite many friends and relatives to share their happiness , but others hold a worlds - apart opinion , believing that the best memories should only be shared with their close friends and family members .
Personally speaking , I prefer to celebrate my important dates with a lot of people .
First of all , I can make friends with people who will probably help me in the future .
As a proverb goes , the more social connections you have , the more likely you are to have a smooth life .
I met my Japanese teacher , Richard , at my graduation party .
Supposing my best friend , Jack , had not invited him to our party , I could not have had the chance to learn Japanese from Richard .
With the help of Richard , I now work for a greatly renowned Japanese company , MoToSiBa , and get a decent salary .
Therefore , it was Richard that opened this window for me .
Second , a party is more than just great food and wine since it is a good place to practice social skills .
Some people may cry out that they do not feel totally relaxed if they stay in a situation with few acquaintances .
However , social skills are really essential when you enter into a company .
If I had one more chance to practice my social skills , I would do my utmost to talk to the people who I did not familiarize with under any circumstances .
This point is quite obvious to be understood when you compare New Year 's Eve and your pet 's birthday .
Everybody will agree that thousands of people crowding on the street during New Year 's Eve to celebrate this wonderful event is far happier than celebrating their pet 's birthday at home .
The reason is , it is the number that matters .
On the one hand , numbers create a good atmosphere , and on the other hand , no sooner scream the first person than everyone in the same place gets excited .
Thus , the sheer number of people creates a joyful atmosphere .
To conclude , I love to ask as many people as possible to come to my parties .
Not only can I meet ( the ) people who might help me in the future , but also , I am able to improve my social skills through these parties .
Besides , the more people at my parties , the better the atmosphere will be .
When I go to foreign countries I am scared of two things :
I went to Japan to study , but I had never studied Japanese before .
It is difficult to live there at the moment .
Because I ca n't speak Japanese , it 's hard to make friends in Japan which makes me feel so lonely , and want to give up studying in Japan .
Even though you might have thought that we do n't practice earnestly , in fact , we do .
Result of Today ` s Work
After a long time , I did carpentry work today .
My physical body was declining . . .
It ` s so frustrating , but it ` s reality .
In the future , as long as possible , I will continue to do carpentry !
When I was in Seattle , I rode the bus a few times .
I realised there was n't an announcement or indication that shows the next bus stop 's name .
In Japan , there is a digital screen and announcement , which helps me relax till my destination even if it is the first time using that bus .
What do you think about it ?
Please tell me what you think .
I watched an interesting news program this morning .
Jack ( Kiefer Sutherland ) came to Japan !
At that time , a Japanese person helped him .
The man did n't know he is an actor .
I think the Japanese man could speak English .
I hope that I will one day speak English like him , too .
I have never spoken English in public .
Only in mail and on chat sites .
Do you know kitty - chan ?
I often hear that famous people like Lady Gaga love it .
As for me , I did n't hate it . But I did n't especially like it .
I often hang out with one of my co - workers , whom I will call `` K `` in this entry .
One day , she said , `` I 'll introduce my friend to you , because you look like you 'll get along with my friend . ``
He is a middle - aged guy whose hobby is to collect kitty - chan products .
I was surprised at first , but I gradually got used to him , and I like the way `` K `` can make friends with anybody .
The guy who loves kitty - chan looks really happy when he gets a new item for his collection .
So , every time I see kitty - chan , I think about it like `` Does he have this item ? `` , and the more I look at it , the more I feel it 's cute .
My goals in the long run
Some of my words did n't convey the meaning of what I wanted to say .
Language is a tool to communicate with people , so bad pronunciation means bad communication .
When I go back to Japan , I want to make my English better , like native speakers .
There are so many words that are hard to pronounce for Japanese such as really , relatively , vocabulary and so on .
There is a similar sound , but this sound is between R and L .
So Japanese people 's tongues do n't get used to pronouncing them .
It seems like there are so many difficulties on the route to achieve my goals .
On the 15th of this month , I sang two songs on the stage at my company ' s end of year party with my colleagues .
Although there was some acoustic trouble in the first minute , the set was largely successful .
Everyone seemed to enjoy our set and the CEO admired my singing : )
The First Thanksgiving ever in my life
Today is the first Thanksgiving day ever in my life .
But , I was surprised that this holiday is so important to Americans .
This is like New Year 's Day in Japan .
Anyway , I will have a potluck dinner this evening , and will go to D .
for sightseeing tomorrow morning ! !
A or The ? Always an Annoying Problem . . .
dreadfully spicy . . .
The level of spiciness was the maximum .
At first `` Hmm , Yeah , This is just right ! ``
5 minutes later : `` O . .
My tongue began to tingle . . ``
I had this tingling sensation on my tongue and sweat was running down my face .
10 minutes later : `` I do n't know why I did this .
This is a nightmare . . . . ``
15 minutes later : `` How stupid I am !
Please bring me more water ! ``
In the end , I ate all the curry , but I have a stomachache now .
Diary in English .
I will try to write a diary here in English .
Although my mother language is Chinese ,
I 'm not used to writing or thinking in English .
Also , I have no idea what I can write .
However , I 'll try to keep doing this because I want to improve my English .
And I hope there 's always someone who will correct my English
Today is a middle day of the year .
In Vietnam we call it ' Tet Doan Ngo ' .
They just had a quarrel a while ago .
I felt very annoyed .
That was what started it ! !
I tried to stop her scolding my dad .
`` Why not take a new towel for yourself `` I asked , this seems very easy to me but it is hard for my mum .
Why ca n't my mum be as gentle as me ? ~ ~ ~ haha
I sent an email and received the reply .
I sent this email to the Singapore Economic Development Board 's Tokyo Office .

I feel happy about it .
We have a relay race at our factory 's site after work tomorrow .
It is the 61st annual race .
Many people seem to have been looking forward to the race as is the case every year .
Anyway , I love running and I think that others also do .
I finallyarrived in Australia last Friday .
I feel like more than a month has passed since I 've been here .
That may be because my lifestyle has changed a lot so quickly . I ca n't believe I was working at a bank until quite recently .
I do n't miss Japanese food yet since my host mom is a very good cook .
I may miss summer in Japan .
It 's quite cold here - colder than I expected .
I like to enjoy drinking in a yukata watching gorgeous fireworks withmy friends .
When I was in Japan , I had no difficulty asking peoplethings and I liked talking to people on the street , but now , it can be difficult .
Not being able to explain what I want to say annoys me at times , but I will keep trying not to use Japanese , although there are many Japanese here and some of them are using Japanese almost all the time .
I hope I will be able to say anything that I want to say in the near future .
I have a few friends that listen to the same music ( or genre ) .
The next train always comes in a few minutes .
In addition , they are very expensive .
Each train connects to a different subway station .
I sometimes choose these lines because I do not need to walk far to get to the station from my house .
Yes , it is very easy to go to my office .
Well , when I take the easy lines , I have to adjust my budget at lunch time . . . .
My first week will start in a few hours time , so I will do my best .
I quarreled with my friend yesterday .
I wish to be happy everyday , so I told myself that I should find something happy in order to change how I was feeling .
Today , I helped my partner come up with a good idea .
And a new partner who received a PHD from America will join us .
That is what made me happy today ! How about you ? Do you have any good news for me ?
Usually , I make a call once a week , but these last few weeks I have n't had the time to .
On the phone , she said , `` Well , there 's nothing special going on , but I 'm wondering how are you doing . `` I said , `` I 'm OK , mom .
Sorry for not calling . How have you been ?
`` Our conversation went on from there .
She is 80 now , and she repeats the same things whenever we talk . So our conversation was the same as last time .
I listened to her nodding , `` hm . . , that 's good . . . . oh . . . `` and my last words are always the same : `` Take good care of yourself Mom . ``
This phone call reminded me of my family member 's blog entry entitled `` Real Mothers `` .
`` Real Mothers know that a child 's growth is not measured by height or grade . . .
She 's way off !
45 years of age - - I wonder what Mom would have thought about it .
65 years of age - - I wish I could talk it over with Mom .
I 'm lucky and happy because she is doing so well and I 'm in a situation which I can take the time to listen to her .
Mother 's day is coming soon , and my mother always says , `` I do n't want anything . I 'm glad that you care about me . This is enough . `` when I asked her what I can do for her .
This year I somehow found out what she wants , so I 'm going shopping to find her `` a nice blouse `` .
Thank you for correcting my dairy .
I 'm very happy , but I think that I have to study English .
I 'm very cold in my house .
I 'm having hot noodle for breakfast
Virginia , how are you doing this Christmas ?
I was 12 years old when I first heard of your Christmas story written as an editorial in the New York Sun .
I was a know - it - all boy and I became sad at that time .
I do n't remember what exactly I thought , but I just did n't like a beautiful story that everyone would love , and did n't think anything about its meaning .
Very sorry about that , but one little child has many things to think about other than a story from a foreign country .
Now I am old enough .
For a grown - up , I have a lot of time to do that kind of thing .
I said I became sad when I read this story , probably because I did not believe in Santa at that time even though I knew it would be comfortable for me to believe in Santa .
Logic has a very strong power that persuades any human being , but after all they ca n't live only with that .
Who in the world would think it funny or interesting to see a boy saying , `` logically to say , Santa is my parent .
So , 100 % probability that he does not exist . `` Even the most optimistic forecaster would never think he will be happy in his life .
She is far better than the logical boy . At least compared to me because she knows how to enjoy her life without dropping into the logical whirl .
She knows this whirl is so powerful that it draws everyone whereas she also knows this is not necessary to make her daily life happy .

I have been enjoying learning English since last year but I still sometimes feel despondent a little bit when I can not remember how to spell a word by myself .
It always goes this way ; I finally remember a new word and then want to type it next time , but then I forget again .
I am always stressed about how to keep a new word in my mind for when I need it later .
Sometimes I consider what is the best way to learn a language besides studying abroad since I do n't have much money .
Meanwhile , I found that people have different reasons for learning English .
Some of them learn English to get a promotion ; Some of them learn it for communicating with customer at work .
But my primary motivation is learning just for fun .
Now I wonder if this reason is too weak to learn efficiently , because there are few chances to use English at my job .
When I was at university , I belonged to the cycling club and traveled about Japan by bicycle .

I remember many Hokkaido people supported us by buying us food and something to drink when I went cycling there with my friends .

Psychologist ( First Name ) Sternberg once proposed that love can be devided into three elements .
They are intimacy , passion and commitment .
The interesing thing ( or maybe it is unfortunate ) , is that men and women value these things differently .
Usually men think that passion is the key to love , but women consider intimacy or commitment to be the key .
It 's because women subconciously care about her ( not their ) child .
And I found a very exciting stastic today .

How to go about building up the organizational system is one of the most important decisions for a companie .
These days , a flat organization has been considered one of the best ways to motivate employees .
However , I firmly believe that the somewhat fierce competition from classification of employees and grades is necessary for the efficiency of organizations .
Above all , as far as money is concerned in this capitalist society , ranks are necessary for the efficiency .
The reason that capitalist societies have been able to be developed is due to the belief that the wealth of the rich was properly compensated for . This has motivated people to strive to follow them by working hard , and developing special something .
Given the companies in capitalism society , this case can also be applied to the matter of ranks in the business world .
If there is no differentiation in the consequence of work , employees would think that there would be no need for work .

I saw a movie yesterday .
Usually I have to pay 1800yen for a moive but yesterday it was 1000yen .
Reading the novels is fun though . XD haha
a ugly women
How to keep a beautiful appearance is the eternal dream of women .
But the one who pursue only the outer beauty is the ugliest person in the world , isn ' he ?
Looking back at my life in the US
As I look back on my life in the US , there are so many things which gave me a shock . In other words , cultural shocks .
In the first days I got to the US , I found some people having sex in the bathroom .
I also met three gay people kissing at the same time at a party .
Of course , the fact that most people habitually smoke weed is also surprising to me .
Other than those , the crazy drinking of college students , and people who always keep their door open even when someone is following them were also shocking .
Although those cultural differences are totally new for me and sometimes scared me , I 've kept trying to adapt to the culture of the US .
After that , I found that I like this culture , and I 'm more like an American .
So far , my life in the US is going well , but when it comes to my English , I 'm still not satisfied with it .
I 'll keep trying to find out more about the people and the culture .
But we almost got delayed following the timetable because we could n't control the traffic and there were many one way roads .
Fortunately we were there on time because of good driving .
I do a double major in Business and Chinese .
The reason I have a double major was because I could see the world was heading towards a global economy and society .
I wanna get lots of various experiences from people of different culture .
As his pimples are clearing up , I expected the doctor would give his green light to go to kindergarten .
It is located in the southern part of Japan , and it is made up of a lot of tiny islands .
Also , Okinawa is famous in that it has many basements .
because yesterday was my younger brother 's birthday .
After 9 / 11 , America seems to be losing its power internationally .
All we can do is turn a blind eye and have an optimistic view , maybe .
I woke up at 7 AM this morning .
There is a beautiful morning glow .
But I feel warmth , power and energy from the sun .
When I saw this morning scene , I thought all things will go smoothly today .
After school , I went to the Centre library in Ilac with my sister .
( And ) I studied for about 2 hours and then I went to home .
When my sister and I were cooking a steak , Michael who is the landlord to my house asked us , `` Did you buy a desk ? `` But at that time we did n't buy a desk yet .
So , we went to IKEA to buy a desk with Michael after we had dinner .
It took 10 minutes by car .
IKEA was very big and there were many things such as desks , pillows and duvets .
We bought two laptop tables , red and black .
It 's about 40 Euro , a reasonable price .
Anyway ( s ) , I bought a desk today .
It 's a little small , but it 's enough for me .
I 'm going shanghai world international exposition next month !
I 'm working at mobile phone carrier in Japan , like T - mobile in USA .
They are sponsors for Shanghai world international exposition , and provide high speed mobile network there .
This is my first time to visit in China , I look forward to it .
In fact , I would like to look for a friend who likes using Skype and MSN and usually chats on Skype . I hope to chat with him / her on Skype to improve my oral English , and I will teach him / her Putonghua . I can speak standard Putonghua . If I can find a friend like this , we can make a concrete plan to help each other . If he / she wants , except teaching Chinese , I also can tell her / him what he / she wants to know about China .
Why am I so eager to improve my oral English ?
That 's because I will be on a bussiness trip to Chicago .
I hope I will be able to communicate with the natives effectively .
So , anybody who wants to learn Putonghua and will help me , contact me . Thanks . I am online all the time .
Ohhhh ~ ~ It 's so great to know about this place : )
Hope I can keep up learning , no matter whether in English or French . . .
I 'm now a sales representative who just graduated from university and plan to study abroad 2 years from now .
Anyway ~ enjoy and thank you !
The crow appeared soon and gave them a large pot , then he explained : `` If you turn your ladle to the right side in the pot , it will give you polo [ 1 ] and if you turn it to the left side , the pot will give you stew [ 2 ] .
The old couple happily took the pot home . They invited all their neighbors and relatives for dinner and they fed them all .
Some days after that the jealous neighbor requested the pot , saying that they had some guests that night . The simple - hearted old woman handed the pot to him , but he never gave it back .
Unfortunately the village 's Khan 's servants witnessed what happened and took the donkey by force as the Khan 's property .
The couple were so unhappy about losing the crow 's gift , they decided to try the crow once more .
Today , I read one article about how , many U .
children are suffering from ear infections recently , in USA TODAY .
I was so sad that they are suffering from the disease .
Also , there are no effective treatments against the disease .
I hope this situation will change for the benifit of our children .
He was so disappointed with his current circumstances that have been bothering him .
I could n't do anything but hear his complaint .
But I would be really grateful if I could heal his sadness .
There are good things and also bad things in our business life .
We ca n't be always in nice situations .
I think that the most important thing to have to deal with these hardships is to keep a positive mind whatever the circumstance is .
I saw the news today about a `` Slutwalk `` that 's happening in the USA and Canada .
The women who were told ' do not walk like a slut ' by police in Canada , became angry and launched a ( this ) campaign .
I think the police should have worded it more carefully , but they spoke the truth . ? ?
How they behave is their choice , but there are n't only gentlemen in the world .
Our choices deserve respect , but we should take responsibility for our choices .
I just wish sexual attacks would stop , however I do n't think that will happen .
`` Judas `` by Lady Gaga and `` Toxic `` by Britney Spears
I like Lady Gaga and Britney Spears .
Because I think Lady Gaga is positive and an unprejudiced person and Britney is sexy !
One of the songs is Judas and the other is Toxic .
Definitely I translated those words , but I do n't understand the meanings . What do they want to say ?
When I was a university student , I was a member of the ski team .
The End of Overdrive
I have finished my last exam , damn , it is so wonderful !
It was very hard to do it with the least cost .
Well , it looks like that it tired me out , I 'm sitting with bloodshot eyes at the computer and I 'm sleepy because I went bed over 5 hours later than usual .
Happily I came to my senses in time .
Now is the time to relax and finally have fun !
I just found out about it yesterday .
It is a Canadian coffee shop .
They have a lot of coffee shops other than Starbacks in Canada !
It is so difficult for me because I did n't know how to order in English . . .
Anyway , I should n't hesitate just to buy coffee ! !
So , I decided to enter the coffee shop !
I said `` Ah - . . .
Double - double ! ! ``
By the way , `` Double - double `` means two sugar and two milks ! !
I was told about it by my host family !
I am happy to be like a Canadian ! !
Everything will be a great pleasure !
I met some people during my American friend 's birthday dinner party last evening .
I met my friend 's friends , my friend 's cousin , and my cousin 's friend .
The food was okay , price was okay , and the atmosphere was okay .
The girls talked fast .
I could n't catch up with the speed of the native speaker 's speech .
My Japanese friend could catch up with it .
I 've been staying here almost three months .
I spoke only some greetings yesterday .
I 'm usually a talkative person , but I was really quiet yesterday .
I can understand English .
Actually , speed is important for casual conversation .
I still do n't find a new job . . .
But , I 'll go to a interview tonight .
and there is an another interview tomorrow .
I 'm anxious . . .
I knew there was a difference of spelling between American English and British English .
But then , all the people who I talked with spoke fast , and my understanding of English was poor , compared to the present .
( Yes , I still have a poor command of English . . . )
How do most American people feel about British English ?
Which English do European people learn ?
I think here , in Japan , we study American English .
And generally , the global standard might be American English .
Someone , please tell me , what is the biggest difference between them ?
Hi ~ everyone
I have practiced playing the harmonica for two months .
Golden week is a group of holidays in Japan .
Golden week comes at the end of April .
My younger sister is much more busy than I am .
She is working a lot of hours every day .
She always has a lot of overtime .
The work is n't over until PM 10 : 00 .
She has no days off .
I am bigginer beginner in english .
I think my diary needs a lot of correction .
However , this semester students from two different groups sometimes have their classes joined and are seated together .
For example today , we had our class at 8 : 15am . ( Dot here , not comma ) . I got there at 8 : 13am .
Oh , my god ! It was full of people in our classroom .
Fortunately , my friend reserved a seat for me .
So I think I should be earlier than before for the rest of the semester .
Because I 'm scared of mosquitos . I hate them .
My friend said that 's because of my blood type .
We will have our classes from 8 : 15 to 12 : 00 , and 14 : 40 to 16 : 10 .
I only have 11 classes per week .
The class I like most is PE , because I can play volleyball .
Yeah , this is my favorite sport .
If we have class , we must go , because the teacher will check .
This is unlike some other countries .
One of my friends is an Italian and he can choose if he want to go to school .
This punishment will be that you t ca n't apply for the scholarship .
But it 's exciting to cook in your dormitory .
Ok , that 's some of my school .
I 'm really happy to join
That was so early , like the time a child would go to bed .
Everybody says that is so many !
They are all girls and also small dogs .
Their relationship with each other is very good .
I think they are just like my real children .
I should go to bed now
because I have class tomorrow at 9am
but I ca n't stop myself from watching a TV series .
I have found a new TV series named Ghost Whisper .
I started from Season four
but I think I can figure out the story .
It 's about a woman who can see ghosts and talk to them !
it 's really cool though
but I 'd rather be a normal person who CAN ' T see those ghosts .
if I could see a ghost ,
I would meet my godmother .
she passed away two years ago because of some strange problems with her heart
it happened all of a sudden ,
I have so many things I want to say to her ,
I wanna tell her how much I love her ,
and how much I appreciate her ,
also I wish I could see my dog ,
it was the most cute and kind dog I ever met ,
I miss it . I miss them both .
No matter .
I think I should go to sleep !
All the train in Tokyo metropolitan area was completely stopped ( or halted ) .
I was uncertain if I wanted to walk home as it was about 20km away , but I did it .
At work , my cell phone did n't work as the telecommunications cables were destroyed by the quake .
What is worse is that the buses were too crowded to ride and there were lack of taxies ( ? ) .
After I reached home , I knew the situation was much more serious in north east of Japan .
That 's why I 'm here , to improve my English skills and to survive university life .
You can learn Thai language in everyday life in my twitter account , and if you have a question ,
I ca n't pass the entrance exam ( the university I want to enter the most ) .
In my spare time , I like to try to relax .
Such as reading some wonderful novels , or watching a lot of movies with a cup of tea .
bungee jumping is a great pastime , because I like the feeling it brings to me ! I feel thoroughly relaxed from daily stress .
In my world , there are good ways to spend my spare time ^ 0 ^
I look forward to using it more often .
This was my first time joining a sightseeing tour abroad .
I seem to have less energy than they do .
However , you ca n't deny how cruel the real world is .
All I can do is keep myself on the right path and try to be happy at all times .
The other day I tried taking a TOEIC Test .
My goal will take a long time to achieve . . .
causes the town serious problems .
laborers will be older .
The town already has a large number of
old people , and the population supporting the old will be decreased
wow , this is my first post and I still do n't have any idea what to write about .
I am learning English and Japanese now and I hope everyone in this website can help me to improve them .
It was difficult to uproot these .
I have experienced a Canadian New Year for the first time .
I prefer a Canadian New Year celebration to a Japanese one .
Because the dinner was very gorgeous and yummy ! !
I do n't like traditional Japanese New Year dishes .
I mean , low in salt , low in fat . . .
The only thing I like in all are Japanese rice cakes .
On the other hand , today we had a lot of feasts that filled the table .
Roast beef , mashed potatoes , pine nuts roll ( this is that stuffings which consists of pine nuts , flour , meat and so on is rolled into pie sheet or something ) and dessert with eggnog ( this is a kind of drink .
Milk , eggs and sugar are mixed together .
Many Canadians like this .
While having dinner , I explained how we celebrate the New Year in Japan .
The meanings of each dish , New Year 's gifts and so on .
They do n't have customs like New Year 's gifts .
That 's what I like about the Japanese way of celebrating the New Year .
I would like to introduce a seventeen year old girl .
Her name is Mio .
One day , the girl had an opportunity to visit the northern country .
She loves the atmosphere , so she strolls through the forest every morning during her stay .
She usually strolls leisurely about the campus in the morning .
This is how it all started .
This weather is called plum rains season .
I hope it would clear up as soon as possible , do n't interrupt my trip .
I met the people who will travel to Europe with me
I met the people who are going to travel to Europe with me .
We were just looking forward to going to Europe .
I went to see some big plants .
There were a lot of Lotus flowers .
I went there with my aunt and a litle girl .
We walked pass the rice field and past the mango tree and then we went to see a beautiful Lotus not far from there .
I had fun and was really surprised because of my friend who called me .
In that place there 's no telephone signal and no money on my phone so I did not reply recently , but then when my parents took me the city I had refilled my money and sent the message back to her .
she told me someone from Japan was thinking of me too .
who is my close friend I am thinking of her too while I was not in Bangkok
I am hungry and I would like to eat something . .
Hey friends do you think my new avatar looks lazy ?
yehh I see that haha . .
so just some picture and in Bangkok is okay now do n't get worried I think every thing is going to be better . .
Add Auto Save Draft
Dear Lang - 8 users ,
Thank you for using our service .
I 'm Kazuki .
One of the major complaints we 've heard from our users is that , `` I spent the whole time to write an entry looking up every other word in the dictionary , and accidently lost everything , and had to begin again . ``
To prevent such incident to happen , tonight we implement the Auto Save Draft feature .
This works like Gmail `` draft save `` feature .
It will autosave your documents every 30 seconds after you begin typing .
If you want to manually save your document just click the `` Save as Draft `` button .
If the computer automatically shuts down ,
Log back on the `` Write a new entry `` page and choose the entry from the `` Drafts `` corner on the left column , which I pointed out in the image attached on this entry .
I hope , from now on , our users will be more encouraged to spend more time writing new entries .

Lang - 8 staff
The TOEIC test
It takes about 150 minutes consisting of listening and reading sections .
We have to keep concentrating throughout this time .
I have been studying hard for it .
Do you mean , `` This is my fourth time taking this exam `` ?
I will do my best , in order to get a high score on the exam .
The First Three Days of the New Year
When I saw his pictures , I felt like time stopped .
My friend said , `` His works are wonderful .
I like his pictures . ``
I was able to relax and feel refreshed at the start of the New Year .
I 'm writingthe words of a song .
How can I tell you ?
I 'll never know the reason for our existence .
June is Japan 's rain season .
The weather is bad the entire day .
But while running , it started to rain .
At least I did n't catch a cold , but still it was terrible .
I hope the rain season will end early !
Yesterday my friends and I went to school , and had an English speaking lesson .
We graduated from high school ( Feb . 8 was graduation ceremony ) in fact ,
, but we asked a teacher to give usan English speaking class even after the ceremony .
The class was very interesting to us ,
especially `` The Guessing Game ! ! ``
The point of the game is to answer what is writtenon the paper that is above answerer 's head .
Another person givesa hint to the answerer .
It is difficult to give a hint and answer ,
A Handy Clear Folder Within Textbook ( Brushed up )
then walking with my bag would be like training to fullfill my ability to carry more weight .
I do n't have the skill to carry a heavier bag , ,
I copied my text book into half size , and sort them out according to each period .
When I leave my house ,
I pick up the necessary part for the day 's study .
I put these parts into a half of typing size clear folder .
I can put this clear folder into all of my bags with a half of typing size notebook .
So I get the oppotunity to study in every situation .
I think it is effective to increase the frequency of studying to get the necessary skills .
Why do n't you make a ubiquitous studying environment ?
I have not gone out at all since my school finished .
I feel that I want to go out or want to see my friends , although I 've done nothing in my house recently .
The first reason : I have a lot of homework ( ? ) .
Which I have not even start working on yet .
The second reason : I need to save money until I graduate .
Let me tell you what happened during the weekend .
On Sunday , I was very busy preparing to send my students to their country , Korea .
Other teachers and I went to the airport , and we did some procedures to enter the airport gate .
But we missed the airplane !
We missed our airline .
We were 10 minutes late .
We begged for help but the student 's seats
We went back home and waited for vacant seats .
Fortunately , there were enough seats for go all students to go back to Korea , although It took a quite long time to get them .
The mango pudding which I often purchase consists of four layers , each a little different in color and flavor .
All the layers are in harmony with one another ! !
It 's the first time I have visited this site
In two month , I will be interviewed in English to enter a company
Most of the time , I only listen and read .
I think that is the reason why I ca n't speak and write English
I searched for a good website to help me study English and finally I found this site
I 'll help those who want to study Korean . I need you help
Is the following sentence grammatically correct ?
We are the members of Photography Club .
We will try to joint - purchase a new camera with good performance .
It 's very good but too expensive .
I think that it seems to be good , small and cheap .
What percentage discount can you give ?
Can you offer a little bit more discount ?
So let 's make a decision .
17 / 10 / 10 - BBQ at the park
We were planning to go to the Zoo , but everyone was busy working .
So we cancelled it .
Since it was sunny , I went to the nearest park with my roommate .
We had a BBQ at Cleland Park .
The park is equipped with a hearing device , so unless we clean after eating we can use it .
In addition , There are some tennis courts next to the park !
I always feel like playing it although I ca n't play very well .
We talked about jobs and the marriageable age of different countries .
I am not sure if we can drink in public place .
In Japan , it is OK .
What about in your country ?
Today , I learned about washing a gastrocamera machine in my clinic for the first time .
All the while I was very careful not to fall down into it .
Because I heard that my doctor had paid about 3000000JPY for it .
So it 's very expensive .
I was really surprised by that .
I 'd be able to buy a car if I had such an amount of money .
And I could n't help myself if I fell in it .
So I 'm very serious / careful when washing it .
And I enjoyed washing the camera .
I 'm always happy doing work .
Well ,
My girlfriend / friend will be getting married this year in Montana .
She is one of my close friends but she is like a like younger sister or family member so I have been feeling happy about it .
I 'll be there when she has the wedding ceremony .
Yesterday , I wrote in my journal , but nobody checked it .
or the theme is just boring .
Today , I went shopping to buy chocolate .
Most Japanese peoplelike sweets chocolates with cookies OR chocolate cookies .
Only chocolate is not so popular for most japanese .
Because Japanese peoplelike carbohydrates .
As you already know , they always eat rice and noodle as a staple food .
So , I think that 's why Japanese people like to eat something with carbohydrates .
Therefore , Most Japanese like sweet chocolate with cookies .
First , I study English for three hours everyday right after work .
Although you know it is an inevitably natural process , it is hard not to think about it too much .
My father is 55 years old this year , but instead of making an effort to keep healthy by exercising like his peers , my father prefers spending lots of time browsing news on the internet .
I really wish all his signs of aging could be slowed ( down ) , or at least not that obvious , but the fact is that I can clearly and strongly sense all of them , which is really painful .
We took an early bath and ate toshikoshi - soba , the buckwheat noodles eaten on New Year 's Eve .
So now I can relax .
My neighborsare having a party and I have been hearing Latin music since this afternoon .
It started raining a while ago , but the music did n't stop
I participated in a match of tennis today .
I belong to the company 's tennis team , and today was an opening match for this season .
We won the first set but we lost the second set .
Finally , we lost the final set .
It was such a close match and we played for about 2 and a half hours .
And I felt the sting of defeatbecause we lost such a close game .
I 'll prepare better for the match next week .
Playing tennis is so fun and relieves my stress .
hm , Just a joke .
Do you know ' Lady Oscar : Rose of Versailles ' ?
But she dresses like a man , because of her parents )
She looked perfect for me when I was young .
I thought she was very strong , nice , and handsome ( or pretty )
even though she was a girl .
My English name , ' Oscar ' ,
causes me to remember this .
, starring Johnny Depp .
The movie starts when James Matthew Barrie , an English dramatist , meets the boy who is the model for Peter Pan .
I did n't know how `` Peter Pan `` was written , so this story was so intersting .
I 'll have lots of time to learn English next month
Because the banquet rooms which I work at will be vacant on the month .
It 's a good thing , except that my saved money will be diminishing without mercy .
It 's not that I 'm not satisfied with the time and money I have ,
but it 's a bit short of feeling wealthy .
I think the reason is that my current job is not the job I really love .
Although I do n't hate my job and I rather like my colleagues .
But I avoided the hardship , as a result , I now stand in this place .
I 'm no longer young enough to change my job .
That weapon is English .
This is my homework for my English writing class .
Let me introduce myself .
I 'm a student at Incheon University majoring in Information Communications , an IT major .
My family is comprised of four members : my father , mother , older brother , and me .
My father drives a bus and my mother is a housewife .
Also , my old brother attends Kongju University and his major is tourism .
He is preparing ( ? ) for various contests .
During the second half of the year , I always plan out what to do next year .
I have sometimes heard `` You love to plan ~ `` . I am reading books related to my future and my favorite CEO is Steven Jobs , the CEO of Apple .
So I read books related to Steven Jobs too .
I also like fiction books from Japan . ( manga ? )
So I will increase my experience with mobile platforms and find my secret passion . ( ? )
Because I was called by the university .
The university said I passed the entrance examination .
I will look foward to my university life .
Now it is 22 : 00 o ' clock .
Tomorrow will be busy .
A windy day
It has been windy since last night .
I can feel the winds a little inside the apartment , even though all the windows are closed . ( since my apartment is old )
He will be graduating from junior high school and entering high school this year .
You need to take an exam to enter high school .
My father worries / is worried about him ,
But there 's a lot of new vocabulary in the book , I can guess to some extent or challenge myself to understand those meanings though : s
I 'm curious about when I will finish reading this book : x
I have used a few of web browsers which are Internet explorer , Firefox , Safari and Google chrome . ( couple = 2 )
I can save time and feel comfortable .
Besides , the user friendly interface is attractive .
But sometimes I am annoyed by bizarre options .
Actually , I was n't able to see pdf files in chrome .
Finally , I solved the issue by entering some keyword into the address bar and chose enable to see pdf in Chrome .
For now , there is no complaint about Chrome .
Could you tell me how different these two expression are :
Moreover , I read an English - translated Japanese comic and in the manga , a character says something like this :
( This is from my memory , so maybe there are some commas but I do n't have the comic to confirm that now )
The difference in how to use subjects and cardinal numbers between # 1 ~ # 3 is not clear to me .
In my company
Everyone wants to be the NO1 .
So sometimes , I ca n't show my concern in the company .
I want to have fun everyday .
My boss said to me `` Finish off this job by next Tuesday `` .
This job is almost finished , but there are a few mistakes .
I do not know what my mistakes are .
Athlete 's foot
I 've got athlete 's foot .
It started a long time ago . It was around my highschool days that I first got athlete 's foot , so it has been almost a decade .
But I neglected to treat it .
I often feel an itch between my toes .
I decided that I do n't need to leave thembe .
So I went to a dermatologist downtown .
He prescribed me an ointment and took some blood ( ? ) for a liver test .
The doctor looks careful and probably credible but since I am for now translating one doctor 's book which criticizes doctors who are too readily `` putting their patients on chemicals `` I am a bit nervous .
But I have no choice for my clean feet in the short term .
I will faithfully follow his instructions first .
The public health care insurance covered way more than half of the total medical bill .
Anyways , I hope this summer I can wear fabulous sandals to show off cute toes and clean feet .
I feel very tired and sad these days , there are so many exams to prepare for , which are rather difficult .
Do you know of the Japanese word `` mikkbouzu `` ?
`` Mikkabouzu `` means someonewho ca n't stick to anything for long .
This word applies to me .
I am a genuine fool .
I am going to continue to write this diary and improve my English skill .
By the way , how should I do to make foreign friends ?
I worked outside only wearing a down jacket , I shivered from the cold wind .
So I 'm going to bed with relief ! !
I heard the sad news about my friends .
This sad news is that my friend quit his job .
He normally works busily and had not spoken about his distress in his company .
I Saw a Movie
I saw a film with Robert Downey Jr . , Iron Man .
In it he is very handsome and smart .
In the movie when he was 17 , he graduated from MIT , one of the most famous schools in the world .
It shows us the various sides & nbsp ; of MJ 's character .
In `` The way you make me feel `` , he seemed innocent as a child .
In `` Ca n't stop loving you `` , he was tender and full of love .
In `` Billie Jean `` , he was absolutely sexy !
In `` Man in the mirror `` , he was a true super star .
I cried so much , it caused me a & nbsp ; headache .
I want to say thank you to Kenny Ortega ( the director ) for sharing with us such & nbsp ; great scenes behind the stage .
It is hard / unbearable & nbsp ; for me .
I miss the King of Pop very much .
Yesterday I saw the movie `` Hachiko `` , about a famous dog in Japan , with my children .
It is not the movie itself that made me cry , but the fact that we missed the first ten minutes , because Mam was mistaken about the time . ``
I made a mistake about the beginning time of the movie .
Do n't worry .
I 'm a Japanese person who is studying English .
I am interested in the foods of foreign countries .
The reason I started studying English is that I want to read a lot of blogs about cooking .
I 'll also try to introduce Japanese food to foreign people .
For instance , recipes for supper , drinks , sweets , and so on .
Today , I went to a pet shop .
I bought a toy for my dog .
It 's a big bone - shaped gum .
Next week , I will give the toy tomy dog .
I suppose he will be happy .
The lyrics are of little use for studying Japanese .
I do not recommend listening to it too carefully .
It involves Java Programming .
I need you to cheer me up .
If I work tomorrow , the next day is a holiday !
I do n't have any plans yet but I have to go to the car dealer ( TOYOTA ) to check my car in the morning .
Even though my car is not a Prius , I am still worried . . .
english radio everyday , and I heard in the news about the Prius today .
I went to a sports shop after work today .
I tried to find ski wear .
It 's season off now , so everything > has become cheap .
English is not my mother tongue ( mother language ) .
I like this language but did n't have the environment or friend / s to use this language .
Anyway , this website is a good place to try to use English and befriend people from all over the world .
Nice to meet you guys , and Thank you my for reading my first English diary entry .
I 'm writing a diary after a long time .
Because The yen is getting stronger ,
I would like to go on an overseas trip .
What country would you like to go to ?
because I have never been there .
I went to a university that is my first choice today .
It was full of fun , and I found a way of learning English .
I do n't have enough time . . .
I like to study but I ca n't do it for a very long time .
Plus , I have to work on a Power Point presentation and a lesson plan .
Megaman Legends 3
I will buy this game . . .
B : It 's red .
A : Wow ! That 's famous .
How big is it ?
A : How much did it cost ?
B : It was worth every penny .
A : What is your license plate number ?
I hope that everyone had been having a good time in the latest holiday .
been happy because I have a new niece . She was born on January 1st , and her name is Maria Alejandra . She is so cute .
I am soo happy because my brother is a man who is really cold with kids . He was apathetic about them , but now he looks as if he has changed . He cares about his little girl and his wife .
I must study hard tonight , because I have many exams this week .
I do not like to study every subject .
There are many things that I have to do tonight .
hey guys , . . .
Right now I live in hangzhou , china ~ ~ it 's a nice place . . .
I like listening to music , like every type , especially jazz , rock , and some nice soft music , some times I listen to death metal too .
I like to sing too , I can sing well , but just chinese songs , haha . . .
I draw sometimes when I feel like there is nothing to do . . .
and also do some reading , which are written by ppl who r not famous but special . . . .
well , now , I will write next time . . .
Recently , I have started running to lose weight .
When I was younger , I ran everyday to train .
So I thought I could still run hard .
But when I ran , I felt a pain in my left leg .
I think my weight is too heavy to run hard .
Now I run at a very slow pace or walk .
I think it is not good for my health to run suddenly .
I 'm 21 years old .
I am a student at Hanshin University .
My uncle and family were very kind .
My sister and I were very joyful .
We went to the opera house , water park , and kangaroo park .
It was a very exiting and special experience .
On the last day , my aunt gave me some Australian chocolate , a kangaroo doll , and a suit .
My sister and I were so sad .
My cousin promised to meet on the internet on Cyworld and Nate On .
This is my first journal entry memory .
And good - bye ~ ~
The new bakery cafe shop opened in Minamimorimach near a station .
I had lunch at this shop .
I ate a sandwich ( Pani ni ) and pumpkin pie .
My aunt is a teacher .
Strange ? ?
I met up with some old friends yesterday .
I have known them for over 10 years .
We drank alcohol and ate Korean food at the first restaurant .
One friend said `` I want to eat ramen . ``
I was surprised because I was full .
But I met him there after a while .
I wonder why Japanese people like to eat ramen noodles after they drink a lot of alcohol .
Is this something only the Japanese do ? ?
I think it 's a very interesting place .
I always want to make friends .
But I 'm too timid to talk with the foreigners around me .
My major is Chinese .
Ever imagined what it would be like if you were swallowed by the gigantic legless reptile ?
The enigmas clear up one by one , and by the end of the chapter , I found myself being able to understand the example code at the beginning .
This book does not begin with mundane stuff , such as ' if - else statements ' , ' using a list ' , ' for loops ' and the like .
At first , it shows off more Pythonic features such as dictionaries , doc strings , list comprehension , and lambda functions , which fascinate me .
This is my first diary entry , so I will like to introduce myself .
My hobbies are shopping , watching movie , listening to musics , girls talk and sleeping in my lovly bed .
I 'm the happiest when I do these activities .
But I got busy because of the preparation for a college 's examination , I can not do them .
Now , I hope to finish the examination and enter the college of my first choice .
Thank you for reading my first diary entry .
I usually do n't enjoy reading books , but I 'm studying English in Canada .
I should do what I can to improve my English .
His son has no friends because he lives in a military area with his family . He also does n't have a sister or brother .
He wants to make a friend , but it is n't easy .
He was very bored of playing alone and decided to go some place where his father said he should never go .
He got scared and ran back home .
The next day he visited the camp again .
He met a boy who looked about the same age as him .
They talked to each other and became friends .
He noticed his friend did n't have enough food , so he brought food to him everyday .
They talked a lot about their own lives .
He visited his friend 's house , the concentration camp .
Hitlers son was cold because there was no heating .
So he told this friend that he wanted to home .
The next day , Hitler and his wife noticed their son did n't sleep in his bed last night .
They started wailing and the movie finished .
That 's what I remember about the movie .
I wanna meet foreigners * - *
I love foreigners so much .
Blonde .
Blue eyes .
that ` s why I ` m learning english .
This is because I 'd love to visit TAIWAN .
I have tried to study Mandarin when I was in junior high school .
Chinese - characters are used in Mandarin and Japanese , so I thought Mandarin would be easier to study than other languages .
Some of meaning of chinese - characters in Mandarin and Japanese are same but some of them are not .
it made me confused .
Although , Mandarin has four accents in one sound ( I ca n't explain about it clearly in English , try to understand ! ) .
For this reason , I stopped studying Mandarin in a week .
It should be great man ! `` .
I 'm sure that K things are popular currently , but Taiwan has many things that appeal ; like its culture ( especially for young people ) , food and traditions .
So , how can I start to learn Mandarin again ?
The number of dead or missing people is estimated to be more than 3300 at present .
The division director of Miyagi Prefectural Police says there might be more than ten thousand victims .
I had Chijimi and fresh egg rolls ( or summer rolls ) for dinner .
Chijimi was too hot , because I put too much Kimchi in it , but fresh egg rolls were good .
My younger daughter helped me mak fresh egg rolls .
We prepared lettus , a cucumber , bean sprouts , chicken , shrimps and labiate for it .
She got the knack of it in no time and she was good at wrapping it after all .
They were beautiful .
I should 've taken pictures of them .
I walked to Daitabashi for about three hours after I went to Azabu with two people , and ate a meal in the Hard Rock Cafe .
I want to speak English fluently and communicate with anybody all over the world .
I think I 'm very lazy about everything .
I often postpone various things that need to be done .
The length of time people live is limited . So how much I can do in that time ?
When I think about this , I feel that I ca n't waste time at all .
She was fat but now she is skinny .
I am afraid to speak in English .
I had dinner with my friends , and some of their friends yesterday .
One of my friends just came back from France the day before yesterday . Another friend of mine is good with English , and their friends are also good with English , so when I met them , I was surrounded by English speakers .
I can understand some of what they talk about , but it 's hard to respond .
But , I had a nice time because they were nice people .
How do I get better at speaking English , especially with Americans and Europeans ?
Do you have some methods that you can provide me , because I think my English is poor : ( .
Today was a fine day .
I went by the Tama river for cycling .
I was resting by the river side when some cats approached me .
So I petted the cats .
His lessons move my heart .
I will try to write in English .
But North Japan has been damaged by the earthquake .
We will do our best .
I bought a new PC .
It was such an exciting experience ! !
I applied for a job as a receptionist in English school .
I found the job offer in an English free paper .
It 's a part time job ,
I only have to work one day a week .
I 'm housewife , so it 's convenient for me to do such a short time job .
Actually , I do n't have any reasons to study English so diligently , but if I get a job which requires some proficiency in English , I think I could improve my English .
At the interview ,
What 's is your weak point in your job
Are you able to adjust your working hours for the students ' convenience ?
I was so upset when I was asked that , because I had not prepared for the job interview .
So I could n't pretend to be smart at all , I mean , I just answered honestly .
but people around me always tell me that they can feel at ease after talking with me .
Probably because I can listen to them very well that 's why they can
feel relaxed with me .
I 'm eager to do something which I ' m interested in , but sometimes I lose my motivation rapidly .
I 'm not gon na go abroad , I do n't have any plans to live abroad . Because I 'm housewife , it 's difficult for me to go far away .
Of course , I can arrange my time to suit student 's situation .
I will keep every Thursday for your students .
Those were my answers .
What would you think if you were the interviewer who owned a cozy English school ?
Today he went to nursery school .
When I was a child , in our city Lego was only sold in a box with Milky Way . There were from ten to twenty ( designs ? ) , but from these ( designs ) I constructed so many different things , it scares me .
10 years have passed but I still want to play with the constructor , because Minecraft enthralled me more than World of Warcraft .
I feel like a kid which gave a million details for Lego .
Essay : Do you agree with making a smoking area ?
I 'm writing this essay to improve my academic writing ability .
Question : The university is considering making a smoking area ; Do you agree ?
I agree that making a smoking area is a good idea , restricting smokers to smoke in a specific location only .
In addition , passive smoking has been said to have the most negative effect among all effects of smoking .
It is a pity that many people are affected by the second - hand smoke , although they do not smoke themselves and try to take care of their own bodies .
We started a new procedure in 1994 .
This procedure is superior to conventional breast - preserving surgery .
Today my topic is about dance .
Does everyone know much about dance ? ?
Nowadays dancing has lots of styles so we can tell the difference between `` old school `` and `` new school `` about dancing .
Old school has many popular styles that you may have never heard before .
`` Breakin `` , `` Poppin `` , `` Lockin `` and `` Hip - Hop `` are old school dances which became famous in the 1970 's - 1980 's .
Poppin is my best dancing style in which the movements are so freaky .
I recommend you watch this dance if you are interested in it or you have never watched it .
New school dance became popular in the 1990 's .
I do n't know about these because these style 's history is not as deep as old school , so I just know the concept of `` make your own moves whatever you like `` .
If anybody wants to know more about dance , comment me please !
Finally , thanks for reading such a boring diary .
Then she jumped from the toilet and started to run away like a duck with her diaper around her ankles .
It allows people to live delightful lives .
There is a host of factors leading to job satisfaction .
Provided that a person worked in a noisy and cramped room , he is less likely to be satisfied ; therefore , a good environment is required .
The employers could equip their office with sophisticated facilities as much as they possibly can , in order to provide workers comfort and convenience .
There is no need for the boss to look at his staff over their shoulders .
In addition , corporations can , every so often , organize some recreational activities , which may let workers feel a sense of belonging .
It is generally accepted that people want to be recognized for their work .
In such case , employees would feel enthusiastic and motivated without feeling that their work is monotonous .
When an individual performs exceptionally well in his work , the rewards would inspire him to be more diligent , and this , in turn , will benefit the company .
Although job satisfaction is very significant , it is unrealistic to have all workers feel satisfied in their work .
However , measures should be taken to achieve this goal , getting as many people having job satisfaction as we possibly can .
The existing practicable and effectual actions should be carried out while new steps are taken into consideration seriously .
I write in my diary two times today .
I go to my job .
But , I hate working .
I watched a movie recently at a theater .
I watched Lovely Bone .
It was an interesting and
very sad story .
I liked this movie .
I think everyone should watch this movie .
Thank you for looking my diary .
It snowed on Christmas Eve .
It was very romantic , so many lovers went out on dates .
It felt more like Valentines ' Day than Christmas Eve in China .
Do n't you think so ? What about in other countries ? Does Christmas Eve seem like Valentines ' Day , too ?
Yesterday , I watched some movies at a theater .
For the first time in my life , I watched two movies in one day .
I watched `` The Rite `` and `` King 's speech `` .
My English teacher recommed `` King 's speech `` , because I could learn British English .
But , I preferred the exorcist film .
I believe in angels and the devil .
I will go with you to the theater ! ( Maybe ? )
beside is a preposition , so it always goes before a noun or noun phrase
Generally it is called a pickled plume in English .
UMEBOSHI is one of the most popular traditional Japanese foods in Japan .
It tastes very salty but it is good with rice .
Often UMEBOSHI is put down in the center of a box lunch with only rice called HINOMARU - BENTO ,
because it looks like the flag of Japan .
Japanese pampas grass is a very popular plant in Japan .
It is often seen in autumn .
Japanese pampas grass was so popular that we could see it near rivers everywhere .
However , I think there is getting to be less of it .
I seldom see it in Tokyo .
This is why I bought some .
But I am sad that I must buy pampas grass to even see it .
I used to enjoy the nature and feel the changing seasons when I was a child .
Cherry blossoms in the spring , sunflowers in the summer , panpas grass in the autumn , and so on .
Now I am wondering what I should display in the winter .
I 've noticed that in English recipe sites , amount of flour is measured in volume ( cups ) .
We put many flowers , incense sticks and sweet treats there , and then we prayed for the peaceful repose of our ancestors .
After praying , we ate the sweet treats which were put on the grave .
Eating them is believed to keep one in good health by the ancestors ' power .
I want to stay in good health forever .
I stayed the night at my friend 's house .
Because her family is Christian .
( My family is not Christian .
so at my house , it does n't really feel that westernised . )
But it felt foreign at her house .
So the atmosphere at home changes because of the people who live in it .
I am going to graduate from Seoul National University of Technology this year .
Afterwards , I would like to go to a graduate school .
I made plans for this winter vacation .
I will travel abroad with my family .
My daughter and I want to go to Egypt .
My daughter would especially like to see the Great Pyramid at Giza and the Sphinx of Cheops .
After I come back from the trip , I will do my best to master English .
I will try to come true it . ? ?
I want to provide help for poor people .
I will visit an orphange , and take care of the aged .
Though it is very difficult to help them , I will try .
I always trust myself . ? ?
I will overcome many sufferings and difficulties .
I hope for an early winter vacation .
I bought a comic entitled `` BAGABONDO `` .
This comic is the story of MUSASI MIYAMOTO .
He is very popular in Japan .
I 'm very interested in him .
Nice to See You All
This is my first time using this blog .
It 's really surprising that the internet can make things easier than you can imagine .
I hope I can speak English as fluently as possible ! ! !
And thanks to everyone who helps me with this ! ! !

I arrived at Perth on the 2nd of August , 2009 .
I went to an English school , St Mark 's , for 4 months .
I met a lot of friends from various countries there : China , North Korea , Taiwan , Brazil , India , Switzerland , Turkey . . .
And even better , I met a Taiwanese girlfriend there !
Nowadays , almost all of my friends have gone back to their country , because their visas had expired .
I miss them , but I believe we can see each other again one day !
I went to McDonald 's today .
It is the most enjoyable and effective method I 've encountered - - after lang - 8 , of course - - so far .
Yahoo answers is a service that enables you to ask and answer questions on several aspects of life .
You also can write about a problem that has been plaguing you , so others can help you with it and give you some advice .
You can pick a category which represents the type of question that you want to ask or answer . Then , type your question or look to see if some questions need answers .
I 'm only interested in `` Family `` , which is a subcategory of Family & Relationships .
I think reading those problems increases my contentment with what I have .
Suddenly , all of one 's own problems seem smaller and more trivial compared to their problems .
So it 's like this :
Answers once daily - - - > 1 point
It 's pretty tempting , right ?
There is also a leveling system .
This diary entry is an overview of Hanasaku Iroha Ep . 6 's .
She is the young master 's acquaintance .
She asserted that the hotel should reform it 's service .
To start , Takako changed Ohana and Nako 's uniforms .
But , the uniform was very indecent .
The hotel 's callers were very surprised .
The reform was not good .
Ohana thought that Ohana and Nako should put them on .
The idea was pleasing to the hotel 's callers .
I take a commuter train and the subway to my office .
It takes about 40 minutes altogether .
I usually ca n't find a seat to sit down .
It is a door that when you open it , you can get into wherever you want without moving .
It is from the Japanese animation `` Doraemon `` .
There are too many people who want get a high grade on the TOEIC .
I 'm gon na take the test in Seoul , which is a little bit far from my garrison .
It takes about one hour and thirty minutes by bus .
So I 'll go away for a weekend and take the TOEIC .
I 'll also see my friends , eat something delicious , and buy some books .
My biography
greetings !
Let 's not talk about sad things , in general my daughter is already grown up .
I was born in Almaty , Kazakhstan , now I live in Portland , Maine , USA .
Since my childhood I liked to draw , in kindergarten the school girls were standing in the queue so I painted them all dolls , especially doll in a swimsuit , and clothes that could be put on these dolls .
In school my notebooks back cover was all drawings of faces in school textbooks , all human persons were corrected , because they seemed not nice enough to me , even grandfather Lenin was transformed into a nice macho !
In winter , sitting in a bus , , the glass was painted with eyes , lips , etc . . .
and this . . .
and this is when my artistic career ended .
I almost every day , I drew out the portraits of movie stars , relatives and friends .
Now I 'm with you here , now I 'm learning to paint living material .
Driving a car
I went to Mt .
Takao in Japan by car ; ) I drove only for two hours but I was very tired .
I want to go to other nice place by car .
How do you manage the corrections you get on Lang - 8 ?
And I have gotten some corrections .
I just read them and understand , but I ca n't remember my mistakes and correct expressions .
So I am considering making notes for this , so I can see my mistakes and I can review them .
I know some of my problems , but it is not easy to correct them when I speak or write in English .
Learning a language is not easy .
It takes time , does n't it ?
Decided to quit my job .
I started to feel pain in my back , so I decided to ask my boss to reduce my working hours .
When I asked him , he told me he needed a person who can work from 6 to 2 without any breaks , and asked me whether I would like to carry on or not .
I had to decide then and there .
I thought my health was more important , and it was just a casual job .
After our conversation , I told my coworker about what happened .
He was sad .
Movable Type Hack - a - thon
I participated in the web developers event last Satruday .
It was called `` Movable Type Hack - a - thon `` , a developers ' event for blogging software called `` Movable Type `` ( hereafter `` MT `` ) .
MT is famous software for blogging , but nowadays it is frequently used as CMS software in Japan .
MT is also known as the rival software of WordPress .
I use both , but now I tend to use MT for my job .
I developed a work flow plugin .
The people who gathered at the event were really awesome developers , and I would never be able to surpass them in developing - yes , they were really really great developers .
I was invited to the birthday party .
Actually , I met her for the first time the other day .
I moved in this village last april , so it is good for me to communicate with new people .
It was very fun .
After we sang , she paid almost for everything .
I said I could pay but she refused .
In Japan , we tend to treat the person who has a birthday .
It is a japanese custom .
But , in foreigh country , the person who has a birthday treat guests ?
By the way , my japanese friend in France had a dinner at his friend 's Taiwanais mariage party .
He proposed all of guests ( 4 people ) to support for this couple because it 's a marriage party .
Everyone paid for this couple but the 4 guests asked why they had to pay for the couple .
This is because the couple had planned it that way .
In a foreign country , is it not the custom ?
I have to work at a part time job today .
There are lots of nationalities . ( plural )
There are lots of different people from different countries e living in Auckland .
I like it here .
The reason why I like it here is because It is ok if I am e different from others .
Other thing that I like is that people are really relaxed and say `` Do n't worry about it `` when I made a mistake .
We might have a misunderstanding between each other sometimes because we came from different counriesand have different ideas .
But I want to try to understand the differences as much as I can .
I never learned about the differences when I was in Japan .
This is a great opportunity for me .
I am writing my diary for the first time .
I am a high school student , currently in the first grade , from Japan .
I am going to visit Australia for my school excursion next February .
So , I want to improve my English skill and know ( more about ) the Australian culture .
Since typhoon traversed japan , it 's getting cool so quickly ! !
I feel that fall might not come to Japan this year , which everybody knows there are four clearly separated seasons .
According to a story , when the news caster said that autumn would n't arrive
this year , a boy who war born in Oct , in other words born in autumn , worried that
his birthday would n't be celebrated .
What children say and do , always amuses us .
When I go shopping , most of my purchases are concerning clothes .
Even though I major in economy , one of my dreams is to be
through a job involving economic or finance .
Last , I would start a fashion brand called `` miki `` .
I just keep going forward ! !
I always use my iPod touch , which is not latest model but the so - called 2009 version .
It 's useful to check my email , twitter , the weather , the capital market and so on .
Because it takes time to boot up my PC , I often use my iPod instead , especially in the morning .
But today it has something wrong with it .
For instance , it requires me to input my password twice to unlock .
I rebooted it but it 's still malfunctioning .
So now I 'm restoring it via iTunes .
Maybe I need to set it up again but that would take time . sigh .
Nice to meet you , everyone .
I am Japanese .
I am an office worker ,
and in my job there are opportunities to meet foreign visitors .
So I need English and I want to speak English .
I 'll try and study .
I have been at North Carolina for 2 month .
But unfortunately , my English skills still remain poor .
So , which one is more polite ? . The expression is as below :
Can I have the data ~ ~ ~ ?
I really wonder which one should I choose .
A typhoon is coming to Japan .
So it has been raining in Osaka for the past three days .
The typhoon comes to Japan every June : (
My friends in Okinawa say wind has been strong and there have been blackouts
Tomorrow it will come to the Kansai area .
And the day after tomorrow it will go to the Kantou and Touhoku areas
Many people in those areas / regions still live in asylums .
Strong wind and rain will make the ground of the mountain weak .
I hope it wo n't let them suffer more : (
This temporary job ends at the end of this month .
It is uncomfortable to stay in an unfamiliar place .
The greatest difficulty about being here is the food .
I take good care of my complexion by eating a lot of vegetables and refraining from bad food .
So , I had my boss buy some vegetables for me .
After I received them last night , I kept them in the refrigerator .
But this morning , I discovered that they had frozen overnight .
If a company builds a large factory near our community , it will make job opportunities around the city .
However , it may cause air or water pollution and noise which comes from factory disposal .
Look at China , they are a typical example .
Firstly , our community will have to think about the advantages and disadvantages in advance .
I think I will support the factory even though I wo n't work there .
It 's because I 'm connected to them .
It helps make business recovery .
Oh today 's essay is crap .
I ca n't write this very well .
What do you associate with when you are asked that question ?
I assume you think you are being asked for your cell phone number .
That was the phrase I used to ask customers to enter their PIN for their debit cards .
It is embarrassing to say , I 'd never recognized this mistake .
One day a lady laughed after I said this .
I could n't catch her words , and I wondered why she laughed , of course .
I asked my Canadian friends for the reason .
They said , `` Maybe she said , ' do you want my cell phone number ' ? ``
Your question is weird . ``
Now , instead of that , I say `` Can you please enter ( or put ) your number ? `` I am very afraid that there are nother wrong sentences I think are correct .
Even if the sentence is grammatically correct , I may use it in the wrong situation .
But I would n't notice that I was using it incorrectly .
That thinking makes me speak softly .
I know it 's not a good habit .
By the way , `` could I have your signature on this ? `` ( while pointing to the receipt ) . This is correct , is n't it ? ?
ceramics club .
He entered an organization for my club .
It 's a very important job , and he felt it was too hard to continue .
There are more unreasonables [ ? ? ? ] and contradictions peculiar to Japan than difficulty .
But , there are circumstances at the organization .
He was not satisfied with that system .
He disliked doing the jobs .
And he disliked being in my club .
But since he continues to go to this club , he must go do the job .
He left our club .
I attended the igo class today .
But soon , one of the francese came to teach us
because he had already learned igo
so he told us some things about igo .
After that , I think my igo technique got a little better .
Thank you very much
I found a sentence which ended with `` thank you very much `` .
I asked my friends what does the `` thank you very much `` mean , and they taught me that it was just a saying .
I am going to Australia in a few days .
Now the Japanese government is buying a lot of US dollars , and the exchange rate changed .
I did n't want the Japanese government to do such thing , or at least wait until after my travels .
My favorite movie is `` A PERFECT WORLD `` .
Buch is a criminal who killed some people .
He escaped from the police .
Finally , Buch died because of a policeman acted by Clint Eastwood .
I always cry when I see the scene where Buch and the kid separate .
I just received the letter from you , I am writing to apologize about the noise with my family .
I have a fault , he is a university student .
My Husband and I know that his work is very noisy , for example , cutting wood boards , color on spray and using a chain saw , etc .
Unfortunately , his university told every student to do the homework at home or rent a house .
There are only expensive rooms in this town , so we can not afford to pay the rent .
We will be very grateful if you can understand our reason .
I want to apologize about this problem to you and to the other neighbors .
He will go to your house next Sunday evening .
I will be very grateful if you can accept his apology .
After writing my last diary entry , more than 3 months have passed .
It is a bad habit to give up what I 've started in a few days .
I try studying programing and algorithms , but they are too difficult for me to understand .
I respect the people who can use them freely .
In Japan , it is 2 : 00 am .
I 'm realy wakeful and hungry .
I 'm eating `` DORAYAKI `` .
It is delicious .
If you come to Japan and eat it , you 'll be happy .
Please help me to develop my English .

Big disappointment by Sumo . Disappointed by sumo
I am not a Sumo fan and do n't have a favorite Sumo wrestler .
But , as a Japanese , I am very disappointed over the news match fixing in Sumo .
But Sumo is not only part of our culture but also a national sport .
I do n't understand why they would spoil their jobs .
In this case , they will be given the sack , but I am wondering how to retrieve Sumo wrestler 's sportsmanship as a professional player and attract fans again .
I hope they know how many people in the world are disappointed by this news .
Here is one of my favorite places in the UK , The Cotswolds .

I was on the side that had to argue that the Japanese government should n't raise the consumption tax .
I could refute the rival 's argument , but could n't argue logically .
I 'm neither used to speaking in public nor speaking in English .
In the end I won the debate , but I made some mistakes . .
I have to practice harder
Here in Japan , the only annual events with a family reunion are shogatsu ( same as New Year 's Day ) and obon ( which is held in the middle of August ) .

It 's about the office I work at .

The `` Grand Prix of Japan `` of MotoGP is later this week .
I rented a room at an Indian 's house , and there is an Indonesian maid .
She is in trouble now because the landlord has n't allowed her to contact her family in Indonesia since she came here .
I do n't understand the ' maid system ' ( I think honestly that hiring maid itself is against the human right even if both agreed ) .
It 's quite ridiculous to prohibit her to call , mail and to have a mobile phone even though I have no idea about the Indian way of thinking or their common sense ( or this is not about Indian but just my landlord as an individual ) .
I can let her use my phone or PC , but is it good or bad ?
I do n't understand why it is a problem to let her contact her family .
Besides my landlord ca n't speak English at all and I ca n't speak Tamil either .
I do n't want to invite any unnecessary trouble , but should I do something for her ? ?
There are many kinds of Japanese tea , such as green tea , matcha , Hojicha , coarse tea and so on .

The reason for studying English
I have been studying English for 6 months .
I want to get a score of 6 . 0 on the IELTS .
My writing score is 4 . 5 , so I have to study more .
If I got a ( score of ) 6 . 0 , I could go to the OET preparation school in Sydney .
I want to know how I could write an English essay fluently .
Moreover , the more one learns the easier one finds it to acquire good learning skills .
And the more one practices one 's learning style the quicker the learning process becomes .
Personally , I have been learning English since early childhood .
In those days , all I wanted was just to know a few words so that I could say just a few sentences in class .
My passion for reading first came from these books : `` Three Men in a Boat , `` `` The Godfather , `` `` Great Gatsby , `` `` How to Steal a Million , `` and ' ' Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . ``
Many years have passed since then .
I am still learning English .
Now that I am an adult and know what my learning style actually is , I can now learn more at a given time .
Having been motivated in high school I think I can hardly stop learning now as I believe there is no end to mastering English .
Thanks for your help to improve this passage .
The man , however , sued his ex - girlfriend and filed a claim for all the gifts he had given her , which included 5 packs of dumplings , a bug zapper , birthday cakes , SPA fare , high - speed train tickets , and vitamins .
Besides that , he also asked for medical fees and mental compensation ammounting to $ 10000 ( US ) .
The judge ruled that the man went overboard and that the gift claims were without merit , so he denied the motion .
If I had reclaimed all the gifts I sent to the girl I had a crush on , I would have an iPhone4 plus PS3 now .
Not only did they cut their ties , but they also tried to retaliate against each other .
There 's nothing more petty than that !
I had been working for an American company for 4 years before I took a maternity leave .
Now I 'm a homemaker and concentrating / focusing on raising my daughter in a totally domestic environment ( which is pretty fun ) , but as the days go by my English skills have obviously been declining . . .
Why do people step on me ?
Why are the other straws so close to me ?
Why do the weather and wind hurt me ?
It is painful . I hate everything .
One straw close to me asked me why I 'm so unhappy .
I said , `` Why is the world so ugly ?
I would n't have done this a few months ago , because basketball was my life .
Of course , I still love playing basketball , but I do n't feel that it 's the most important thing in my life .

By the way , until yesterday , I have never taken the TOEIC exam .
I was n't sure how many people would be there , or how difficult the actual exam was , I had taken the pre - test before though .
In fact , it was difficult for me , but I seemed to enjoy the difficulty .
I heard that our daughter was scared at first , but once she glimpse their performance , she became interested in it .
Although I have n't had a chance to talk to her since then , I can imagine what she would say .
I 'm looking forward to talking to her .
I 'm going by bus .

I have decided to write in English .
I will be transfering from my university to another university .

The nuances are so difficult .
Japanese is easier than English .
Yesterday , I learned about C + + at my university .
It is too difficult for me .
I nearly could n't return home yesterday .
I stayed in a lecture room from morning ' till night .
It was a nightmare .
We met and we went to have lunch at the Sydney Central Plaza .
After we finished lunch we ate ice cream .
We arrived the coles ( ? ) and we bought a ( bottle of soft drink ) ( soda ) .
We watched the movie ' The Toy Story 3 ' while eating some snacks .
After the movie end we took a nap for a while and talked to each other about my concerns .
My girlfriend has been worried about me because she may love me .
I decided to go back to Korea soon .
I should have learned English and about Australia .
If I had good English skill I could get a job .
I will improve my English skill .
I wanted to see my girlfriend , so I called her and we hung out for a while . At that time one of my flatmates came home with some sushi rolls and we flocked to the table and stared to eat them .
As soon as we finished eating , my girlfriend and I left the living room and stretched together .
We are getting bored and tired so we going to go to bed at 1 O ' clock .
On facebook , I made a new friend today .
Please teach me its meaning !
I am surprised to have received so many things free of charge .
I 'm going to make 2 journals this weekend to make up for having broken my promise that I 'm going to keep a diary everyday .
because my friend has come out of the hopsital .
My questions which I ca n't ask people now because I have not used English for a long time .
I 've never thought how poor my English is .
It was great summer vacation for me .
After a 2 - week vacation in Tokyo I came back to my apartment in America .
A Japanese woman who lives in the room just below mine , came upstairs to greet me .
Woman ; `` Welcome back ! ``
I have good news and bad news for you !
Momoko : `` Well , let me hear the good news first . ``
And what 's the bad news . . . ?
Woman : `` It 's a long , mysterious story . . . ``
Woman : While you were away , I noticed a peculiar sound in the kitchen during the night .
Momoko : A Poltergeist !
`` One night I heard the sound in the cabinet under the sink . ``
I put my ear to the door of the cabinet and listened .
It sounded like something was scratching a bag containing rice .
Woman : `` No ! ``
`` I banged on the cabinet door , hoping that the scratching sound would stop . . . ``
`` and it stopped . ``
Woman : `` Yes , and . . . ``
`` There were a few scratches and bites on the thick paper bag of rice . ``
I showed the bag to the landlord and . . .
Woman ; `` He handed me this . . . ``
What should I do if a rat - mistakenly eating the poison and suffering - jumps from the kitchen cabinet ?
What should I do if I find a dead rat in the cabinet ?
I 'm going to replace my daily journal topic , `` Internet slang in Japan `` , for `` Kind police officers `` today .

I have an excuse not to go to the gym because of the rain ; )

Today is the day that Japanese people suffered from the Nuclear weapon that was dropped in Hiroshima 65 years ago .
The ceremony about mourning the people who died from this bomb has been held every year ; this year it is even more historical because the representatives from western countories participated in the ceremony , especialy the United States .
This change was due to the speech that was given by President Obama in Berlin .
What I was most impressed by , was that the Secretary General Mr .
Ban Ki - moon read a speach , speaking strongly , about how it is necessary to have a strong will to achieve world peace without Nuclear weapons .
I think he may have some mixed feelings because many of the Japanese showed cruel behavior towards the people in the Korean Peninsula ; he might be blamed by some Koreans who do n't like the Japanese .
He visited and made some speeches in Japan over those feelings .
Which way is better to tip : waiter or waitress ?
I 'm not sure how to tip at a restaurant because I 've just moved to America and my mother country Japan does n't have such a custom .
? Which way do you think is most appropriate ?
1 : I would pay the bill and tip in cash .
2 : I would pay the bill in debit and tip in cash .
3 : I would pay the bill and tip in debit .
I could always do this in 1 or 2 ways .
If I do 3 , should I write an amount of the tip down in the bill ?
I would be happy if you correct my English composition . Use your native expression : - )
I wish I could be as smart as the genius , Albert Einstein .
I have returned to my hometown from Hiroshima today by airplane .

The college entrance examination are over and we need to be relaxing .

I went to junior college . So my school life was for 2 years .

Hi , It 's me , erin .
So I have no furniture .
Today I went to Santa Monica to buy a sofa .
I bought a sofa made from brown leather .
Recently , there is something I think about
Why do people often say . bad things ?
I do n't think they notice the words they say will hurt someone important sometime .
They do n't know how much it hurts someone .
I do n't want to say any words which I do n't want to hear from anyone .
Everyone needs to be kind and should take care of everyone around them
Recently , when I talk to by my boss she always says some words which make me sad and nervous
Like , `` you are already too old , take care not to catch a cold `` `` I do n't have any idea why you can not get a boyfriend `` `` oh you 've got some weight ! !
Even though She is 9 years older than me , she also does n't have a boyfriend , She has more weight than me , and She says that just in front of our customer ! !
I am keeping my patience all the time but I feel so tired during work .
I came back to my house tired , my mother said something bad to me also .

This morning , I painted Inukashi , a character from the novel NO . 6 .
My friend phoned me to kill time . [ more natural ]
I sometimes dislike her because she scolds me for not following what she says .
Also , I can only save a very small amount of electricity , so I feel helplessness .
It 's very tough for me to think about anything in such muggy weather . . .
It is dangerous to invest all of your money at once . Therefore , I divide my money up and invest a small amount in each currency .
Yesterday was Sunday .
I have not made a `` New Year ` s card `` yet .
I want to send one to my friend .
Next year ` s symbol animal is the rabbit .
I drew a rabbit on the card .
I have posted the voice journal to see if my English is understandable .
Please try to start this video and listen to it without the transcription .
I have decided to post voice journals here , because there are only so many opportunities to speak English in my everyday life .
Sometimes , I talk to one of those friends on the internet , but he studies Japanese hard so I always end up speaking in Japanese when we talk .
I have posted some English video blogs on YouTube in the past .
But , I could not post a lot , because I could n't think of anything to talk about all the time .
But , Lang - 8 is different from YouTube , because people can correct my English .
I appreciate everyone 's corrections so far , and thank you for listening to this journal .
I went to the shopping mall because my daughter wanted to go .
Drums made a merry rhythm , and the whole store was in a new years mood .
My daughter hoped to buy one .
A `` lucky bag `` is a grab bag ( a bag of unknown articles ) .
We ca n't choose them , so I did n't want to buy one .

This is just an aside :
I 'm now preparing for the entrance exam of a graduate school .
By the end of this June , I will be working as a banker .
But I change my mind and decided to enter a graduate course .
I do n't want to regret about my decision .
But I 'm worried about whether I can get a new job after I 'll leave there .
It 's because new young graduates are most likely to have more chances to get hired by Japanese companies .
A long time ago , when I was learning to swim in the swimming pool ,
Since I was a very young child , I used to swim in the shallow lane .
Unexpectedly , I fell into the deep lane that was used only by adults .
I struggled to get out of the deep water and I eventually escaped the water .
But I had almost drowned ,
I have been scared of deep water , swimming , and pools since then .
But recently , I have been learning to swim in the swimming pool again .
If everybody challenges against their fears , they can overcome their fears .
I do n't know who will read this , but I 'll keep updating it as often as possible .
I 'm working the night shift and watching the Olympics right now .
I 've been watching it on TV constantly since It started .
I did n't think it 'd force me to stay up this late at first , because there is only a 1hour time difference between China and Japan .
Our house is 950 square feet , so it is a small cute white house .
Yesterday , 2 couples came over and saw our house , and we got some responses but we did n't get offer yet .
Tomorrow someone is coming here , also we are going to having a open house on this Sunday .
I hope we can get a good offer soon .
I 've been a little a bit tired lately .
This is my first time writing .
In the future , I want to write about my impressions of watching anime .
Do you have a favorite singer ?
I 'm interested in rock music now .
Actually I have n't been able to sleep well lately ( I do n't know why . . .
maybe it 's because of the world cup ? ? ) , anyway I stayed up until after midnight .
It 's kind of annoying , and of course I counted sheep but it did n't work .
So I just turnd on a fan and took the time to relax . . .
then , in the next moment , I was woken up by sunshine .
I realized it was 10am and I would be late .
In Japan , after having graduated from college , most of Japanese students work immediatelyand continues to stay within the company for at least 3 to 5 years .
Eventually most recent graduates wind up staying there for a couple of years even if they have lost the interest of working in that company .
In fact , I had worked there for several years , and I hardly saw people who worked for more than 2 years .
I had about 20 staff ( subordinates ? ) ( Co - workers ) under my position .
But only 1 or 2 people had remained working for 2 years in the company , while the rest left within 1 year .
Today , I did a work out with my friend
and then I watched the Super Bowl ball ! !
At that time , I stayed with my friend , her boyfriend , and her boyfriend 's friends .
I could n't speak with everyone but I think it was really good experience for me .
I wanna do my best before going back to Japan !
Today , my classmate gave me plums from his yard .
He is trilingual .
He asked me that why I had n't attended class last Wednesday .
He asked If I dared to eat fat meat .
My answer was `` YUP `` and then he drove me to a Vietnamese grocery .
While I took a look around in the Vietanmese mom - and - pop store , he petted my shoulder and said , `` Here you go , a Vietnamese sandwich . ``
At recess today , he still pulled me to the corner again and asked me if I wanted the plums and vegetables .
He knows that I usually cooked on my own to save money .
At that monent , I almost burst into tears .
It is sure that my TOEIC score is very low .
However I like to watch some English movies and talk to Englishmen ,
What should I do to improve my English skills ?
And I read some books in English everyday .
I know I need to make an effort .
Recently , a Japanese company declared that the official language is English .
They should use English in every situation .
If I am in the employee of this company , should I hand in my resignation ?
This ( passage / paragraph ) explains my medical work .
We selected prostate cancer samples from radical prostatectomy because , between 1997 and 2004 , 48 . 5 % ( 99 / 205 ) of surgeries at our hospital were performed following neo - ajuvant hormonal therapy .
Recently , Most surgeries are performed without neo - ajuvant hormonal therapy at our hospital .
Therefore , the analyses of samples from radical prostatectomy without neo - ajuvant hormonal therapy are currently ongoing .
It took 90 minutes .
It was a bit hard but I enjoyed it .
I think I have good balance because I surfing sometimes .
We were very sweaty ! !
I love to sweat while doing sports .
Tonight I saw the film version of `` The Phantom of Opera `` at home , which played on TV for almost three hours ! ! !
But its music is really fantastic . The voice of the leading actress deeply appealed to me .
The beautiful voices in the movie impressed me a lot . Like a haunting melody in my mind .
I was truly touched by this sentimental movie , especially when the phantom let Christine and Raoul go , I could n't help but shed my tears .
I sympathize with the phantom a lot though he is sometimes too cruel . But I think it 's his society that made him crazy .
How lonely he was ! ! !
It 's a pity that he could n't bring his talent into full play .
He was a genius !
Well , since I will go to NY this summer vacation , I expect to go to Broadway to watch this show live .
I got a new one .
Tonight , I am painting .
I 've already done my job .
I was really excited , because I had no idea how I could I get a new idea for an art project .
But now , I am painting my new art work .
I am thinking about space .
This space is full of power , because everyone can see it but , others not just us can see it .
What should I write to introduce my community ?
By the way , I broke a string ( ? ? ) : (
I have to replace the string .
I signed up yesterday , and this is my first diary .
I am so glad I found this website to learn english on .
Hehe , I wish I could make more friends around the world .
Most of my family 's generations have only one child .
I am a Gemini , and my blood type is B .
However , now I need to use my english for my business , so I do exercises to improve it every day .
Thanks a lot !
The Phillies Won !
At first , I did n't want to watch the game because I wanted to / had to study .
The Phillies led most of the game , so I was n't very worried and strongly believed they would won .
However , by the eighth inning , the situation changed .
I found out the Rockies led .
In the ninth inning , Ryan Howard scored a two run hit and the score 4 - 4 .
The score eventually turned to 5 - 4 in the top of the ninth .
I ca n't take my eyes off the postseason .
Halloween party
Yesterday , I went to a Halloween party in school .
I thought one thing : how different it is bitween Japanese people and others .
When I went to the party , everyone made themselves up and wore costumes such as Dracula , Zombies , and Vampires .
It was so funny and amazing because I 've never seen a party like this when I stayed in Japan .
Then , we danced in a room .
But , most of the Japanese people did n't .
I know why . Normaly we do n't have this opportunity to do this kind of dancing in Japan .
One more reason is our personality . Generally , Japanese people are shy , quiet and unconfident . This is only my opinipn .
We are especially unconfident , pessimistic and negative people .
I think this is one of our personaity problems and it 's because we are afraid of failure .
Actually , it depends on the person .
I mean , Japanese people need to have more confidence and courage .
I believe that this will be interesting for someone who is leaning Japanese because I will be comparing life in the US with that in Japan .
Every professors ' main priority ey is to improve the quality of their classes .
On the other hand , Japanese universities provide more opportunities for research .
This difference causes by the way to evaluate university . ( ? ? )
These rankings are considered to be very important .
In turn , there is less ranking among universities in Japan .
I finally realized that working as a day laborer does n't suit me .
If I work little by little after school weekdays , I can cope with studying and having a part time job .
Even though I 've worked as a day laborer for two years , I 'm through with doing it !
( I 've just noticed this entry is full of negativity .
I 'm sorry if this entry makes you feel unpleasant . )
My favourite foods are ice cream , pudding , chocolate , cake , yogurt , sashimi , sushi , tempura , gratin , and so on .
Today I changed my hair color because my brown hair was so bad and my hair was so damaged : ( I decided to change my hair color ! !
And I 'm trying to grow my hair out .
When my hair is cured , I 'll dye it again .
I am familiar with this hair color .
Because I had black hair entering university .
But I do n't like black hair because I think it is so dark and makes the face look unhealthy .
I 'll change the topic .
It was such a nice time .
Recently my work has been busy so I could n't study hard because I do n't have free time . . .
but I want to keep writing journals ! !
I think this work will one day have good results .
Teacher : OK , would you please look at these two sheets ?
One is your son 's , and the other is the one of the student sitting next to him .
Father : So what 's wrong ?
Do you [ think / believe ] that my son cheated because both of them wrote the right answer ?
Question 2 , `` Where was the port that the Black Ships ( called the ' Kurofune ' in Japanese .
They were the first mission from the US and shocked Japanese people at the time both politically and culturally . ) called at ? `` .
There are many many ports in Japan .
And my son and that student might happen to write the same wrong answer .
My son wrote the right answer , and that student cheated .
I live in West - Japan where we were not affected by the aftermath of earthquake disaster .
What will happen to my life and where Japan will go ?
Normal life is priceless , I found out after things happened .
But , I think , now , It is time to make an effort to spend life as usual as possible .
To the contrary , what I can do is carrying out my responsibility for myself , my family , and my community , so we can be able to spend their lives with each other .
For Japan , for me , and for my children 's generation .
Today is a beautiful day , is n't it .
Now I feel comfortable in the season of new green leaves in Japan .
Some day , I want to talk with my friend in Spanish and I hope to become better at them sooner .
- Since the surgery can cause respiratory complications , sleep apnea , snoring , mouth breathing , the student nurse should focus on assessing ( monitoring ? ) the respiratory system .
- The patient has a risk of infection , the student nurse should check to see if there is elevation of WBC , assess the incision site , and assess whether the patient has a fever .
- Assess whether there is any bleeding .
Since the patient had surgery on October 4th , the pain may increase , so it is really import to assess pain .
( respiratory rate , depth or shallowness of breathe , and lung sound ( clarity ? )
- Encourage patient to drink .
The surgery may make it difficult for the patient to swallow , but it is important to take in fluids to prevent dehydration .
- Inform patient and family members about the potential complications
- Teach patient and family members about post care of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy
I spend so much time doing these things .
I am almost stressed out with English and some other stuff .
People enjoy parties on that kind of boat .
Usually , people eat sasimi or traditional , Japanese , expensive foods on the boat .
In that regard , though , we can only eat cheaper food ; Japanese pancakes [ okonomi _ yaki ] .
We still enjoyed the atmosphere sufficiently .
If we become rich girls , we try authentic Yakata _ Bune .
I did n't know what Genpets were until yesterday , when one of my friends in the English course had an extra presentation - - a punishment for letting her mobile ring during the course - - about Genpets .
Color coding displays the personality type .
Genpet Red : Athletic and energetic .
Their life span is 2 to 3 years .
So the question is : what do you think of the idea of these Genpets ?
And would you like to purchase one of them ?

Anyway , let me finish my saying my real dream . work by saying
I am sorry that I replied to your comments late and I did not write my diary everyday .
I will go back to Ohio on April 10th .
Recently , a problem occurred .
Materials for daily entries are out of stock !
I have always looked around for something interesting on this site , and collected incidents that often happen to us .
I wanted to find different feelings among countries .
I ca n't recognize such materials for entries anymore .
I have n't came across this slump for a long time .
But underneath this surface , some people have bad habits in their job and their relationships internally .
They always pretend to be upstanding citizens but some people know their dirty minds .
I also dislike them because they always treat others unfairly .
They always make us angry .
I wish they 'd leave as soon as possible .
It is a national holiday in Japan .
I think I 'll spend the time watching movies or playing tennis .
I 'm getting used to the weather here , but the one thing I still ca n't < - get used to is the time while when the sun rises in summer .
It could be daylight from 5am to 9pm .
It 's a little strange for me , it 's not dark during supper time , and also we can eat dinner outside ! !
I 'm crazy about it .
It 's been long time since I visited here last .
Hi , to all of my friends who I have met here previously .
These days I have some trouble with my roommate .
Recently , I 've felt something wrong that has invaded my day to day life .
In the truth , I feel confused about what to do .
There is a little burden on my shoulders .
For me , I dreamed to become a social worker not that long ago ,
I am thinking repeatedly about what to do in the future .
However sadly , still I still have n't worked through what I am going to do for my happiness .
He loves and is addicted to exercise at the health club and therefore , he 's been the at the front of his laptop at his desk .
He wants to have a cake and eat it too all the time .
That way he 's always have a meal beyond midnight and talking , trying to get me to eat with him .
His gobbling sound gives me sleep apnea . It makes me a little crazy .
How should I tell him about my troubles ?
I 'm in third grade at middle school .
So myself and my classmates had to clean our classroom and neatly dress in our uniforms .
Korean schools have quite strict rules about dress code and hair .
Fortunately , my uniform was n't pointed out . ( If so , we would get bad point . )
I wish that Korean schools were more free like foreign schools .
Today is my day off
I studyed English from 7am to 9am this morning .
I began studying it since last January .
I 'm trying to write sentences using expressions I 've recently learned . ( learned recently )
It helps me remember new expressions .
For the most part , all of them seem as if they are not correct owing to a lack of practice .
If you try hard enough , your command of the foreign language which you are learning is guaranteed to be of a high level ( eventually ) .
At least that 's what I would expect .
With regards to the aforementioned approach , I recommend you make index cards as a vocabulary list .
When you learn something new , write it down on a card .
Then , whilst writing a diary in your second language , pick up ( or select ) a card from the deck and apply it .
What do you think of my method of learning a new sentence ?
Do n't hesitate to try it ( out ) .
Also , be patient with the time needed to brush up your skill .
Oh , and one more thing .
I almost forgot to say this , and it is by far the most important tip !
With all mentioned ways , the most significant hint still remains .
The hint is you need Lang - 8 friends helping with their native tongue which is also your foreign language .
Have a nice day .
I have a muscular pain .
Yesterday , I started a new activity , Capoeira !
I like sports and I regularly go to the gym and train .
My good friend .
Yesterday , my good friend came back to Taiwan from Japan .
She had been to Japan on holiday for two months . She 's so lucky !
So she arranged an appointment with me ,
I did n't know where we should go .
The weather was really hot ! > <
So ~ ~ I decided to have afternoon tea again ! !
Her school is far away from me ,
so we only rarely get the chance to see one another .
However , when we met this time ,
it was just like we had not seen each other in two days .
It felt miraculous . I like that feeling . = )
I hope we can be good friends for a very long time .
It is a little difficult for me to go to bed .
I have had the dream for four days .
For example , someone who has a knife chased me in the dream ,
Last weekend , I went to the movie theater to see the last film of the Harry Potter series .
It was Ladies ' day , so I could watch the film for only 1000 yen .
In Japan , it costs a lot to see the movie in the theater compared to foreign theaters .
When I tried to buy the ticket for the film , I was recommended by the clerk to watch the 3D version , but I heard from my friends that some people tend to feel sick while watching 3D films .
Especially the last scene of the film , the battle between Harry and Voldemort was impressive !
I think that I am a rare person on this Lang - 8 'cause I do n't think there are many Japanese people here .
I could n't be bothered to work today , so I skipped work .
I am a sales person , so it is okay since I have a contract nowadays . ( I am the second person who has the highest sales . )
I like : you tube , facebook , mixi , skype , call of duty , PES , drinking , football , listening to music
as you can see , I am kind of a Japanese geek
I am not keen on studying English language .
I do like to hear the English language but this is my hobby not for study .
I 'm doing an internship but I 'm thinking about quitting
I work for a printing office .
I mainly do the kind of simple , repetitive work that anybody could do
But it can often be a big responsibility .
While my coworker , who entered the office about 2 weeks after me , gets better jobs .
Sorry if this entry is negative
We 're going to move to another building next week so today all of us coworkers were packing a lot of stuff .
I took some pictures with my coworkers as a memento .
Anyway I got my wish and took some good pictures .
I 'm a kind of fun - loving person ; I love to think happy thoughts all the time .
Because I have no good memories of my childhood .
Having hung out with my boyfriend since last August , I 've taken a lot of pictures with him .
We went to a lot of places and every time I looked back at my pictures , I get a warm feeling in my heart .
Radio Aeorbics
Do you know what radio aerobics is ?
It is well known all over Japan .
There is no one who does not know this exercise .
Radio aerobics starts at 6 : 30 , which can be used as an alarm clock .
New Year 's Day .
My last entry just crossed over into the new year .
That 's OK , but I always get annoyed with little things like this . . .
sorry for the ( irrelevant ) details .
You have still time to do whatever you forgot to do in 2009 : )
Both of them have been dead for a few years .
It was so sad to think about the `` death `` , but we want Pome if we had a chance to keep them .
Nowadays , dogs and cats are sold on the internet .
I know it 's better to find foster parents , but I think I want to meet them before I decide to buy them .
( You may ask what is my wish for .
Happy New Year !
I want to speak English fluently this year .
To tell the truth , I do n't like studying languages .
Once I open a textbook , I start doing something other than studying ,
such as reading comics , watching television , and playing games .
But this year will be different .
Please teach me an efficient way of studying English .
What do you think ?
This is my first time coming here . I learned of this website from my teacher and found it to be a really good place to study English . At the same time , I want to make some friends here !
My birthday is April 16
My birthday is on April 16 .
But I do n't know how I am going to spend that day !
Today , I took a paid vacation .
Because , a typhoon came to Japan today .
But , the typhoon passed Japan early this morning .
So , I was relaxed .
I went to a library .
I borrowed the novel `` Green mile `` witten by Stephen Edwin King .
I do n't know if I will finish reading this novel .
But , I will try !
Recently something happened in my house , so I just do n't feel comfortable .
Whatever my roommates and I will solve that .
This time I know the person who can be friend or just have distance .
I held a wedding ceremony about one month ago .
Many friends and relatives came to our wedding ceremony .
I thanked my parents and my wife .
so I think the wedding ceremony became special .
And I will never forget that special day .
We are a happy couple !
I feel sorry for her .
The Japanese are basically modest .
Because the Japanese value respect for other party .
And the Japanese were agricultural people in ancient times ,
they have grown alongside nature .
So a Japanese spirit developed that respected nature .
This is my first diary entry .
By the way , what are you gon na do during spring vacation ?
Well , I 'm gon na go to Taiwan
My brother is staying in Taiwan for three months on a business trip .
So I 'm gon na go to Taiwan during that period .
Of course , I 'm gon na stay at my brother 's house .
I 'm studying Chinese a little now 'cause will be spring vacation soon .
My emotions
I think I am a calm person but when I engaged in hard talk with my friend , I lost my ability to control my feelings and could n't say anything and I felt like I could n't think anymore .
I know I could express my feelings better if I was calm but what I can I do about my emotions ?
I tried to compose the songs with English lyrics and if my mistakes are corrected I 'll greatly appreciate it .
= The Child is No More =
Whose justification will help you not to feel alone ,
Without fear of the future
I 'll step into the open door
So , today I 'll introduce myself .
My home town is very small and by surrounded mountains and is located in the center of Japan .
I grew up seeing the Japanese Alps in the distance from my house .
I lived with my parents and my elder sister who is married and raising her son and daughter with her husband .
We had one very cute white cat .
On weekends , I enjoy cooking , swimming in the pool , practicing Yoga in my room , and reading books .
And I 'm learning Japanese tea ceremony once a week .
I 'm interested in Japanese traditional culture , such as tea ceremony , kimono , and Japanese flower arrangement .
Nowadays these are something that many Japanese pay money to learn .
Some people wear kimono often or everyday ( for example , those who are obsessed with Japanese culture , who learn / teach tea ceremony , Japanese manners and Japanese flower arrangements . . .
Though , many Japanese do n't own their Kimono and they use a rental service so they can wear a kimono only when they need it .
We do n't do tea ceremony in daily life except when our families or ourselves are familiar with it .
The reason why I 'm interested in Japanese culture is that we need to have skills well balanced in many genres .
And , we become eager to learn every genre equally .
When I learn tea ceremony , I became eager to learn good handwriting , languages , behaviour , and flower arrangements .
When I learn martial arts , I become eager to learn behaviour .
It 's not necessary that the level of all our skills be excellent .
The important thing is that we have equal skills in many genres .
As a beginner , you need to have every skill at a beginner 's level .
If you go intermediate in one genre , you need to have skills which are better than a beginner 's also in other genres .
I think Japanese traditional culture has many more things than we can learn and understand throughout our whole lives .
I will try writing about these things I learned .
As an Engineer , I 'm interested in medical [ medicine ? ] and technology .
I hope I can make friends who are interested in these topics , and practice talking and discussing them in English .
Thank you for reading my long introduction written in poor English .
Dec 10th : Shrek 3
I watched ' Shrek 3 ' on TV tonight .
It was the first time I had seen the movie .
I was a little tired because I 'd been busy . ( another option )
I ate some pears and drank something hot .
Hmm , I 'm falling asleep .
Recently , I bought an iPod Touch . It makes studying English more interesting .
In fact it is very useful and has a cool design .
But one problem with it is the battery decreases in an instant .
By the way , I like watching Japanese animation movies .
This entry is about what I talked about with my friend today :
What should I do while I am a college student ( in other words , before I graduate and work ) . . . ?
I did an internship in Japan for 6 months , and it killed me .
It was like this : I worked from 8am to 10pm , 6 days a week , and I slept a whole day on Sun because I usually did n't sleep enough , and I felt so tired everyday .
Then Mon came and I worked so hard for such a long time , Mon to Sat . . .
I seriously did n't have any time and energy for investing myself in the future .
I 'm crazy about books and usually read everyday basically FOR FUN .
BUT I could n't even read during the period .
How the hell could I study something that will be necessary in the future ?
We students do n't have money .
But we have plenty of time .
Of course , I have to say students are also busy with study , part time job , etc .
But compared to people working , we are absolutely so free .
So what I wanna do in a college is something which I have to spend a lot of time on to get .
So far I came up with 3 things .
Seriously , I think that if I study these things before I graduate and prepare myself for the future , my life will change in a good way .
I 'd like to explain more details about those 3 things , but now I have to study for the exam which will be the most difficult yet ( in fact , its killing me ! ! ! )
I have so many things to do .
My memories of the U . K .
My stomachache was caused by eating different food , which was not suitable for me after all . Because of my illness , I could n't enjoy the trip .
I 'll never forget that trip .
But she lied down on the sofa .
And she had tears in her eyes .
Now she is again sleeping on the sofa .
I went to Yakiniku with 10 people who are from the U .
We first tried awkwardly to speak in English .
Then , we started eating and drinking as much as we liked .
We drank a lot of beer , because they could hold their liquor well .
There were often two beer mugs on the table per person .
The Swedish man said ' ' Kampai ' ' every fifteen minutes .
The thing that was most surprising for them that day was drinking Japanese sake .
They had drunk cold Sake before , and they said it tasted bad .
So , I asked if any of them wanted to drink with me , but nobody wanted to .
This time I ordered a warm sake bottle with two sake cups , and I planned to drink slowly until we left .
I poured my cup and then another one so they could try the warm one .
We drank it , then Nick said ' ' It tastes good . ``
Then , he started to pour sake for all the international students , one by one .
After just 5 minutes , the sake bottle was empty .
I was in dumb surprise , because they drank sake cup after cup .
And then I realized that was the last order .
So , Japanese should tell foreigners not to drink sake like they drink tequila .
If you forget this , you will see the bottle empty in a short time .
I 've got a reason why she stopped chatting suddenly .
She sent me a message .
I attempted to write a diary until today but I was n't able to because I was very busy .
Today , , I decided to write in my diary again .
Now , I 'm studying English harder in order to make the TOEFL score .
but my writing and speaking skills is not too good .
So I 'll try to use this tool again .
Learning English for me is not easy , because I originally studied German .
Now I have finished 9th grade .
Finishing school , not in Russia but in Ireland .
Therefore , I need to deepen my knowledge of English .
I went to the beach to go surfing yesterday .
Although the waves were small , there were a lot of surfers in the sea .
The waves were smaller than previous beach and there were a few surfers .
So I decided to go surfing at this beach .
The sea is a little cold .
On the way back from the beach to my house , I ate ramen .
I always want somebody to correct my English sentences . . .
I want to speak and write English more naturally . . .
I read a newspaper which said that there are many Americans who like to use this social network , and that someone even took days off of work just to play it at home .
I also found out that Twitter is getting popular in Europe and America , but here in Taiwan many tech - geeks use Plurk more .
Because Facebook has a Chinese version , I spent some time registering for an account .
It is not what I though it would be , I originally though it was supposed to be a Blog interface or something like that .
To keep up with the technology is very important to me , something new in this era may be out - of - date in the future .
a cucumber
picked from our kitchen garden
I 'm learning about how to improve my English skill from a book that 's title is
It 's a very impressive book for me .
The book offers ways of English study through seventeen people who succeed in English study
The book always shows me how to solve a slump .
I ` M NOT IN THE SLUMP YET .
I finally finished the tough final exam .
To be frank , I 'm not good at math in any way whatsoever .
I have an excuse .
I did n't take any math classes in high school .
^ ^ During the mid - term exam , I screwed up the Stats actually . .
I scored horribly .
^ ^ ( I can not laugh . ) But this time I hope the result is gon na be better so I can get credit . .
My friend 's brithday birthday is next month .
We wanna do something .
But we do n't have any good ideas .
I will be waiting for your nice ideas .
are good for beating the summer heat .
What kind of foods are effective in your country ?
I 'm feeling pleasant at the office today .
Riding my bike through the forest on the way to the office and the ginger pork may have contributed to that .
Today is a good day . : )
Recently , I was extremely busy because of the end of the fiscal year .
I had to make a document for this year 's results from flight training .
By the way , our flight squadron has an interesting tradition .
I work at the Japan 's Air Self Defense Force and I operate an F - 15 which is a combat airplane .
Our squadron 's character is the Tengu , a Japanese long - nosed goblin .
It is said that once upon a time , the Tengu lived in Mt Hiko which is the highest mountain around my airbase .
The shape of the Tengu was like a human being but he had wings and could fly so we adopted it as our mascot and our flight squadron 's guardian angel .
Actually , each squadron 's flight time for the year is assigned by our headquarters .
After finishing the year 's flights , we usually climb Mt Hiko because we report the safe completion of the year 's flights to the Tengu and pray for next year 's flights to be safe .
Do you know about the `` ocarina `` ?
It is a wind instrument .
I did n't know that .
Ocarina players will try to set a Guiness world record
in a park in Nagoya tomorrow .
They are trying to play with over 600 people all together .
We are gon na go to the park today , so we have to organize it .
This morning , I got into trouble .
When I climbed down the stairs to get to the train , I twisted my ankle .
I was withstanding the pain during my work , however it 's gradually getting more and more painful .
So , after my work , I went to the drug store and bought fomentation .
I wanted to see if e - books are good or not .
I have been trying to read `` The New York Times `` , `` Washington Post `` , `` Time `` and `` Newsweek `` on Kindle .
I realized reading newspapers on Kindle works well , but reading magazines does n't work so well .
Browsing newspapers by headlines is easier than browsing magazines by article titles . Maybe that 's a little more natural .
Where does this difference come from ?
Magazines on Kindle in Japan do n't have pictures .
It suddenly started raining while I was washing my hair this evening .
That meant the four - day long heat and wetness had come to an end .
What 's better is the cool wind has been coming .
Thanks to the
`` Yes , just do it ! `` . I praised myself so much that I only ate a cup of sesame paste , a banana and an apple as my supper .
But I know a diet is a
rather long journey , and it demands a lot of persistence and endeavor .
I 'm in a bad mood today . . . . .
I do n't know why . : (
Anyway , I have a Japanese class and a student has come to my class .
I 'll try to my best ,
to look on the bright side !
There is an incoming hurricane in my area .
The news said it will come tomorrow or the day after tomorrow .
The weather forcast says there will be heavy rain tomorrow .
I 'm go to my office by scooter everyday .
I will go by train instead of a scooter tomorrow .
Going by train takes longer than usual .
I like nice days .
Today , I watched a video on youtube .
In the video , a man appeared who can speak English and Japanese from Australia .
He said ( in Japanese ) `` three tips of how to study a foreign Language . ``
Second , think simple .
Last , do n't be shy to use a / the foreign Language .
Unfortunately , I could only see the last ten mimutes of the game .
Yesterday was Halloween , so my friends & amp ; I walked around downtown wearing costumes . ( Good ! )
There were a lot of people wearing costumes ; they were crazy and funky .
After that , we went to night club to dance , dance , dance ! ! !
We would say : I was up all night and I do n't feel too good today . There is n't anything to do .
Wearing a Kimono
I have learn how to wear a kimono for about 1 year .
As a Japanese , I was ashamed that I could n't wear a kimono by myself .
So I decided to learn how to wear a kimono .
It 's really good for me to learn how to wear a kimono .
I 'm proud of the culture of my country .
For the last two months I have made 2 round trips to Siberia and back .
During these trips I changed planes 12 times .
And moreover , this fall I took two domestic flights within the USA .
Today , I had a P .
I chose to play soccer ,
so I am very tired .
I have played soccer for seven years .
The World Cup of 2002 was the most exciting event for me when I was in elementary school .
Now , I am in the middle of preparing for exams ,
so playing soccer was good for a change of mood .
I noticed that Mr .
He is n't famous among Japanese , because he did n't have a professional career in Japan .
It might be possible t for him to be selected for the national team of Japan .
There are many Japanese coming up big in a variety of fields .
I am glad to hear about those .
I 'm studying American History in the 19th century now .
What are the differences between abolitionism and antislavery politics ?
There are two reasons this happened .
Second , because I studied all night before yesterday .
I had a lot of tasks to do until yesterday .
( There was a ) thunderstorm this afternoon
I think ( a ) meeting like ( that is ) just ( wasteful process ) ~
today I passed the eiken 2nd grade !
I 'm so excited and happy !
Since I had stomach ache for 3 days and I thought it was different from usual ache , this morning I saw a doctor in the holiday clinic in our town .
Then she prescribed two types of medicine for me and told me not to drink alcohol and see a doctor after the new year holidays .
Actually I did n't feel well when I got to the party , and I drank non - alcoholic drinks .
On the weekend I went to the country by train .
It was an amazing trip due to beautiful scenery in the country .
I saw native Australian animals such as kangaroos , koalas and many varieties of birds .
I visited my friend to celebrate her birthday .
Today , my university announced the participants for the language courses to study abroad in Davis , LA , and Victoria .
I applied for Davis one , and I passed it .
But actually , I had mixed feelings .
The Australian course has fewer costs than the American one .
The office was located in the middle of the business district , in Shinjuku .
The scenary was overwhelming and the company was smart and decent .
Eto was very kind and he emphasized the importance of younger people going abroad with his rational theory .
If I study abroad in Australia , I will study at the Gold Coast for two weeks and enjoye sightseeing for around a week !
I 'm wondering what the place is like .
I 'll add sentences or write a new journal entry later because I have no time now .
The anime `` Usagi Drop `` is so cool that I watch it every week .
Watching it makes me feel good .
She has been looked after by Dikichi since she was a preschool kid .
Daikichi took her into his care when Rin 's father died .
I 'm very glad to see that the cool weather 's coming !
Teacher said that Expressions of frequency , speed , and duration do not use ' in ' .
' There was almost a nuclear disaster in last year . ' is wrong .
' There was almost a u nuclear disaster last year . ' is correct .
Recently I 've been working very hard .
By the way , _ I wanna study English more .
I wanna speak English .
But _ I have no time and no money .
I went to work this morning .
She knew that I only started working 3 months ago , so there are many details that I still do n't know .
After she left her job was transferred to me .
Now I am the only employee in the office .
I work very hard and I get so tired from working from morning till evening .
I am looking forward to the time when someone will come to help me with all the work .
Hopefully my boss will soon find someone to help me .
Do you have any favorite authors in foreign countries ?
I think it is a great opportunity to improve my writing comprehension skills .
In addition to that , I think that I can keep motivated to write in English .
Before I read her paperbacks in English , I did n't know anything about her .
I love her books very much because I can feel sympathy for each character in her books .
Since she has written a ton of books , I really would love to read them all !
I 've never written a fan letter in English before .
I guess I can look for how to write formal letters via the Internet , but I do n't know which is better , typed letters or hand written ones .
When you write fan letters , which do you think is better ?
I also want to ask you when I write , which kind of things should I pay more attention to ?
If you know , please teach me .
This morning , my mother - in - law called and told us a relative was going to visit as well .
He was so funny and interesting .
: D In addition , he used to be a professional soccer player and played for a national soccer team , so I 'm interested in his time as a player .
I hope my enthusiasm for soccer will arouse his interest .
The most popular spot where many people run is around the Imperial Palace .
There are many shower rooms there for runners .
Some people who work near the Imperial Palace run during their lunch time .
I 'm going to go to a relay road race on Thursday .
In Japan , about a decade ago , antibacterial goods became very popular since many young women got worried about how clean things were .
However , I sometimes think that Japanese people pay too much attention to cleanliness .
In addition , it seems that children tend to rely on antibiotics when they have a slight cold .
My 11 month old baby had a fever last night .
I put a suppository on him and wiped his back and stomach with a wet towel .
He was in the hospital for 4 days just 10 days before , but now he 's sick again .
Today , I saw a snake in a path between the rice fields .
The snake hurried and past in front of me .
After a short time ( After awhile ) , I walked again when I find scales of the snake in the bushes nearby rice fields .
I talked with my friends who live in Japan by skype after so long .
Since they have not changed a bit , I was relieved .
I listened to their story , they are still having a hard time due to earthquake and electric power plant in Fukushima .
Japanese people are in holiday season from April through May 8th .
That means , I do n't have much work !
But I 'm not sure what I should do when I have no work !
We enjoyed shoe skating in the dim lights of street lamps and car headlights .
I watched a movie about the NBA on YouTube .
After watching the movie , I was getting an urge to play basketball .
Actually , I 'm playing basketball in PE class .
So , I want to be good at it and surprise all my classmates !
I caught a cold . . . : (
And I caught a cold today .
I was in good condition until yesterday .
but I do n't want to do anything now . . .
My mother said to me `` Will you go to the hospital tomorrow ? ``
But I hate the hospital !
If I go to the hospital , my cold seems to get worst and I feel that my body is really getting weaker !
So , I my cold goes away soon so I can avoid going to the hospital !
Hello every one !
These days I have been super busy and that 's why I have n't been able to write my journal entry . . . ; (
Please correct the letter below .
I 'm going on a trip in May and I am struggling with booking airplane tickets and hotels .
I booked by phone and they asked me to send them e - mails to confirm my name , our airplane schedule and so on because of knowing our check - in .
This is one I want to send them .
Title : Our flight schedule on May 26th
Dear Madam or Sir ,
This is Mami Hakozaki , who called you today .
We have 2 people total .
I would like to stay the nights of May 26th and 27th ( 2 nights and 3 days ) .
I 'll show you our airplane number and schedule below .
Flight Itinerary :
About smoking .
Before I write to my diary , I will say some other things .
Last night , my eye suddenly turned very red .
It is not good for my eyes .
I already know this , but I ca n't control myself in using the computer .
If I ca n't use the computer for a day , I will feel uncomfortable .
I probably got addicted to the computer just like my addiction in smoking .
I came to this training school for about 2 months already .
I think , I can now speak some English to someone else .
But with the last night 's topic , I was n't to express myself .
Probably , I am not interested in that topic , my vocabulary is not enough or my English is still very poor .
Last night , the teacher came from America .
He is a very handsome guy .
But I do n't think he can teach students well .
We discussed about smoking .
The topic is very simple .
Indian parents teach their children smoking , but their least age is 2 years old and yet , they can already smoke several cigarettes a day .
It is normal in India .
A 2 year old child was smoking .
He was sophisticated like an adult and can smoke 2 cigarettes at the same time .
People were laughing around the child .
Parents should be responsible for their children . They must protect and guide them to a right direction .
I do n't want to admit . . .
I do n't want to admit that I am a bottle - man .
I found out about this website a few days ago , and I found it to be very helpful to me .
I want to improve my English and Thai .
Thank you ! !
It has been drizzling since last night .
This recent rainy season has had heavy rain , thunder and lightning .
Rain that falls quietly calms down my mind .
Today I talked on MSN with an Indian guy who I met through italki , which is an international social networking service website .
He said that my English pronounciation is really good , however , I could n't speak much .
I 'd like to be able to speak more .
3 ) about my future plans
hay fever
It seems that I have gotten hay fever recently .
I get back from going outside , and I ca n't stop sneezing and I have a runny nose .
In Japan we eat osechi .
it is a special New Year 's food .
Recently there are a lot of people who buy osechi .
Many Japanese foods are delicate and takes time to prepare .
I have to make one or two menus for my husband 's family .
Whenever I think about it I become very nervous .
It is possible to increase the Japanese food in this year . ( ? )
My daughter goes to an international school ,
I have to communicate with her teachers , friends and parents in English .
I hope my English will get better if I could continue writing a diary in English .
I 'm sorry I 'm slow at English .
If you can , I would be really glad that you could check my dialy .
This is a very high rate of wight gain
S is a car - society , I do n't have to walk a lot when ever I go to somewhere .
Hello , my friends ! !
I like to read hero stories . . .
I hope to improve my english so I can fulfillmy goals ! ! . . .
Sometimes I get a cold after I am exposed to other people in a crowed .
I take some medicine just in case .
Need a Refresher
It is the weekend , and I have plans to hang out with my friend .
I do n't want use my weekend to study or do homework anymore .
Because I know that studying too much makes me become sick and stressed .
After that we will go to the park to get some fresh air .
I have a part - time job every day except Monday .
I am a greeter in a restaurant .
Last night , it was a pretty busy day and ( ? ) could n't work properly .
So , I want to consider what happened and how to prevent it .
I thought about three things
Firstly , I think the main problems were an insufficiency of communication and state of mind .
I mean , we were too busy both mentally and physically to take time for others .
Secondly , the system to check what was ordered and what we serve is not efficient .
To solve these problems , I should relax a bit .
I mean , I should n't be tense all the time .
And then , try to let others be at ease . *
The solution can be a stronger bond among the hall stuffs !
* I want to write , I want them to relax more
I want them to work seriously , but be able to interact with others
While I was there for only for a week , I was astounded by the fact that American people are getting bigger and bigger every time I visit there .
It 's no wonder that President Obama is having trouble on the health insurance policy .
I 've heard that Japanese genetically can not become so heavy because we become sick before putting on too much fat .
I sat still on a plane for 12 hours on my way home , wondering whether the economy class seats are big enough for the chubby Americans and I was thankful that I had to leave the States after one year back in my high school days . I had put on 10 pounds during my stay !
There 's too much good food in America and it is very inexpensive !
The G20 Summit should be scheduled for three or four days , and not two days .
Some Koreans have criticized the G20 meeting organizers .
This year we have less of electricity .
For example , I will not use air conditioning .
I will try to write a `` Game Play Diary `` .
I 'm playing `` Shadow Complex `` now .
so , I am trying to beat Insane and get 100 % items and get to level 50 .
Yesterday I went to a Korean restaurant with my close female friends .
We were chilling out with delicious dishes and drinks .
I was invited to go skating by my friends today .
There were a lot of people in the ice rink .
I supposed they wanted to be good skaters like Kim Yona .
I 've never expected to skate in Korea .
My lang - 8 friend VN gave me a good idea to make audio recordings in order to improve my pronunciation .
fm service , which seems very well suited for tasks such as this .
Could you please listen to my first recording and let me know what you think of it ?
Yesterday I told you that I wanted to be friends .
I hope to maintain our good relationship .
It is the best season in Japan right now .
There are a lot of full bloomed cherry blossoms .
They looks like pink clouds .
It is Xmas morning here now .
I went to play CS with 2 boys yesterday morning .
I play shitty , and always die . : D
So , I quit early and went to bed at 1 am .
I should sleep more . but I do n't want to miss Silent Night .
Actually my Silent Night , was really nothing special .
I woke up at night and went to watch `` Prison Break Season4 `` and `` Bleach ``
Ahhhh . do you think I had a boring Silent Night ?
But I enjoy this life .
I have to go to school .
I 'm in my school right now .
Ha . . .
But I 'm playing on the computer !
Because of a club activity !
It 's my first diary I have written here .
Nice to meet you !
From the first day I cut my long hair until now , I ca n't remember how many times I have cut my hair .
My friends say that I 'm crazy over hair cuts hahaha .
Last Sunday I cut my hair again . First I thought it was OK , but on Monday , when looking again in the mirror , I see that . . .
maybe I look more manly than before hahaha .
My hair now is super short and I wonder when it will be long enough again for me to change to a new style ^ _ _ _ ^
My dear hair , please grow long quickly . I want to look more feminine , not manly like this o _ _ O
I am from China .
I like to listen to English songs .
But I feel that I am poor in English .
I am a college student in China .
I hope I can make friends with you .
I just got back from a tiring journey .
We drove to Kyushu , which takes 8 hours , with my husband 's sister whom I ' have to be nice to ' and her three kids . Saw them off and met my sister with her three kids ( one of them is newly born , whom I had to take care of ) at a small airless apartment in Kumamoto . We then moved on to Hakata to see my husband 's cousin and his three kids ( who took turns crying ) and took my sister and her three kids to my parent 's house in Hiroshima .
I used to hate such rural living but after watching people in big cities ( despite their conveniences and gorgeous houses ) , Shimane is still the best place to live and raise children .
Fresh air , beautiful scenery , people are friendly . ( I took it for granted sometimes . )
The first date of my life
I did not expect that it was the one I watched for the first date of my life .
After the graduation ceremony for junior high school , I called at her house by using the yearbook which told me her address .
My voice did not come out though I tried hard to talk .
Now I watched it again , I 'm sure this movie is quite high quality , and it was not fault of this movie but of me that we did not have another date .
I like jokes and Im funny , I think .
By the way , Im going to go NY next Feb to April , so , where would you recommend ? ?
Please give me your ideas ! ! !
Also , I was in Canada ( Vancouver ) last August .
I made many foreign friends ! ! !
I dont mind your age , sex , or nationality .
If you wanna learn Japanese or learn about Japan , Ill teach you .
lets talk ! ! ! !
I played kendo in my / with class yesterday .
It is very tiresome and painful , but it is very interesting .
I joined Lang - 8 yesterday . This is the draft of `` About me `` .
Since I began a language exchange at `` Japan - guide .
com `` this February , I have had very nice experiences teaching Japanese .
I have exchanged emails , corrected letters written in Japanese , helped with assignments for degrees , given guidance on how to learn hiragana for the first time , etc .
I am sure I can correct the Japanese sentences you write and explain my corrections in English , if you understand English better than Japanese .
Today , I will introduce Japanese culture .
Today 's topic is `` konbini , ``
But Japanese convenience stores are different from any other country 's convenience stores .
In Japanese convenience stores , you can buy anything you want , like a variety of foods , grocery goods , tickets , stationeries , beverages and confectionery .
In addition to this , you can withdraw your savings , and send your baggages by delivery service .
To be honest , I have n't been doing well these days .
My heart and mind are not in sync .
So I ca n't catch up with myself and am taking such miserable feelings out on my friends and family sometimes . . .
Do n't look back . It wo n't do any good . Do n't look ahead . You 'll just be misunderstood .
Does anybody know which hashtag is useful for people who want to ask native Japanese or English - speakers about what one does n't know in their second language ?
I wanted to use lang8 while at work ( I mean during break time )
I 've been trying to search for such hashtags , but I could n't find one .
Hopefully this hashtag will be like a dictionary that native language - speakers can use to teach non - native speakers .
It 's like a perfect dictionary .
The Hanbok is a traditional Korean clothing .
I want to introduce the Hanbok to foreigners because it is very colorful , and
has an elegant atmosphere .
It is very beautiful .
When I was young ,
I thought the hanbok was very old fashioned and not chic ,
but now I think the
hanbok is very special .
It also has history ,
and was our national clothing for a long time .
Two hundred years ago , most people in Korea wore a hanbok .
Today , we can often see the hanbok through historical dramas and weddings .
These days , I 've been studying very hard .
When I 'm studying there , I feel very comfortable .
Today 's class was kind of boring , but I was able to learn a lot of grammar .
Most of koreans do n't use radiators .
Because most koreans do n't wear shoes and often sit on the floor .
there 's no carpet , just wood floor .
I do n't wanna overwork and I need a lot more time as my private time .
I think that we ca n't decide anything if there are too many choice .
But There was a huge number of different kinds of reference books for learning English .
He could n't choose only one book because of the overwhelming choice .
He graduated from Hamilton College in New York in 1926 .
After graduation he became interested in the work of the American behavioral psychologist John Watson and the Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov .
Yes I 'm a big fan of B .
It has been dangerous to walk outside , so the university had already closed classes today .
However I 'm in the university in order to make the handout by tomorrow .
I want to return home early . . .
In order to improve my English level and application ability , I picked out some useful words from the textbook and made example sentences for each of them .
I have made a survey about the student 's sleep ( pattern )
I 'm concerned about my English grade
The shoes are tied loosely
When I come to this school , I have to undergo a series of things
During the summer , there is always alot thunder
During summer , there is always thunder when it rains .
We have had heavy rain in Japan , especially in Kanto Area these days .
The rain was seriously heavy .
When the heavy rain suddenly starts and falls seriously heavily , we call it guerrilla rain .
I decided to write a short diary every day starting today .
I went to Kasai aquarium with my friend .
I enjoyed it more than I thought : )
I want to go see the pandas at Ueno zoo next time .
Hello , everyone .
I studied a poem in today ` s Japanese class .
It is about love and family
Our Japanese teacher the poem , too .
Do you have a favorite poem ?
I want to see a lot of foreign poems .
Of course , I want to see Japanese poems too !
Please check it !
A : You 're a liar .
When we got to Lang - Hoa Lac , our motorbike broke down , so we had to look for someone who could repair it .
While we were waiting for our motorbike to be repaired , some of my friends were annoying each other .
We had to wait for 3 hours for help . ( Plural form . )
As soon as we arrived in HaTay , my friends decided that it was too late to climbing mountain , so they wanted to swim even though I was against it .
Unfortunately , we forgot our way home ( because the route was different ) .
On the way home , Lien ( my close friend ) realized that she had lost her bag . She guessed that she had lost it when she was standing next to a strange man .
There were many things in her bag such as her phone , money , a watch , etc . . .
I told her her that I 've never had such a bad experience .
In the end , we returned home safely .
I got very tired today because of doing many interesting things like moulding candles and preparing for my exams .
I learned a lot of new words dealing with financial vocabulary .
Hope that I 'll do this a lot faster than I have done my other sunday chores .
I got a serious headache this morning while sitting in my cubical , so I took a half day off and left work at 1 pm .
It is about Chinese New Year , so I really want to get caught up on my work before the holidays , that way I do n't get too much pressure after I go back to work . . .
That may be the cause of my horrible headache .
Anyway , enough about my misery : p
Not so many people do that these days , I guess it 's pretty much the same in the case of Christmas cards .
Well , if anyone who happens to see this entry , and is interested in getting a Chinese New Year card , please let me know : D I guarantee the card is going to be cute , and Chinese : )
There are two sentences .
Is sentence 2 wrong ?
Nice to Meet You
I 'm a Japanese man who wants to learn English .
I really want to learn English .
If you want to teach English to a Japanese person , please contact and help me .
At the moment , I 'm trying to improve my English , so that I can have the chance to be an exchange student .
Fortunately , I met a great teacher , Wanyu , when I attended some English classes .
And I also made some new friends who speak English .
The only thing I need is time . . . .
I hope that I can improve faster !
I said to her that she could buy it if it 's not expensive .
We went to the register with this icosahedron - shaped figurine .
He look stunned .
Yeah , How much is this item . . .
Then , he came back with a yellow piece of paper .
`` This is a type of toys .
You can get the details with this manual . ``
he said and spread the yellow dirty paper .
this object can change into various animals .
First , wrap up Rinfone with your hands and tug ``
She wrapped up Rinfone with her hands as he instructed .
Then a clicky noise sounded , and one surface of the icosahedron - shaped raised .
She did as she was told ; the other surface fell in .
Do you know a toy named `` Transformer `` ?
It is a toy which was popular ago .
A cassette tape changed into a robot , or a gun changed into a robot . . .
Please imagine this Rinfone can change shape into a bear , eagle , or fish when we push or roll a part of the icosahedron - shaped item .
Even I think its a great toy .
`` This is a pretty old item . . .
we forgot the fact that we are selling it . . .
If you get it up onto an Internet auction , collectors will buy it for half million yen . ``
She is good at haggling .
Finally , She knocked it down to 6000 Yen ( about $ 75 ) .
Then I wanted to exhibit some things to Yahoo auction , abbreviated to Yahuoku , which is similar to eBay .
But as I was taking pictures , I had some trouble with my mobile phone 's SD card .
I will try taking some again tomorrow .
It 's a 3 - day weekend in Japan .
Actually my husband gets one more day off , so it 's a 4 - day weekend !
I have been listening to music recently .
I was very busy April because of recruiting . ( job hunting ? )
But now I decided the company I will work for next year .
So I now got some time to relax ,
and decided to listen to many songs . ( or a lot of music )
I found Offspring 's and Coldplay 's new CDs , and started to listen to Mr .
Mr . Children is one of the most popular musicians in Japan .
They express the delicate heart of love .
I want to find more good CDs .
Do you know any good CDs ! ?
Feeling Bodyaches
I 'm at work now and I 'm looking for a return mail from another company .
My boss gave me a list and I need to contact the companies on the list .
Because I have to contact another foreign buyer by phone today .
I hope I 'll get used to phone calls in English .
. My whole body feels painful .
My teeth ache , my stomach aches , and my head aches .
It 's a warning sign .
Relax !
Do n't be stressed !
You do n't need to freeze due to a different environment . ``
Okay , I will try to have a different mindset .
However , I am still feeling achey .
I 'm surprised !
The Design of the top page of Lang - 8 has been updated .
I think this design is more like the design of other SNSs such as mixi or FB .
To keep active users , SNSs have to be changed continuously .
I hope Lang - 8 will be improved more and more .
This morning , I went to the hospital .
Around noon , I got back home .
I took a nap for about two hours , and then went to my sport 's activity class .
I am a little bit tired but I enjoy that class .
I just wrote a journal entry about baseball last time , but this time I try to write about sports again .
Last night , I went to watch an NBA game for the first time , that was the Philadelphia 76ers vs .
My friend got the tickets from his company and kindly invited me to watch the game with him .
I have wanted to go watch the NBA since I came to the US . , so I was really excited before arriving at the stadium .
The game was so exciting and also the seat was amazingly good .
In fact , we sat just 2 rows behind the cameramen .
That was very close to the game and the players !
Later on , I noticed our tickets were worth $ 350 .
Although I have n't followed the NBA for a long time , I always liked watching the NBA when I was in junior high or high school .
I think the NBA was more popular then than today .
I 'm wondering whether most of my Lang - 8 friends do n't ( will ) remember that .
Anyway , last night I realized the NBA is still popular and I might start watching the games of the 76rs .
Some people have been on holiday since last weekend ,
I ordered some English text books from Amazon .
and I just got them this morning .
Although , I do n't know whether it was because the transportation company is fast or that Amazon is fast - -
In summer , what is your favourite fruit ?
my answer is watermelon , because it 's full of water and very delicious .
Changsha is called a stove city , one of the five stove cities in China .
Average temperature reaches 39 degree , and sometimes even more than 40 .
If there is nothing I have to do , I would rather stay at home .
If I were a little child , slept in the watermelon , what a happiness it is !
My Job
I am working at a school .
I help students with making documents .
But I realised ( realized ) it is really difficult .
I think it will take between 5 and 10 years to learn it well .
So , I have to learn the language more while working in my school .
When I open the window of the bus , the air outside is so bad .
It smells like fuel . I do n't like the odour .
I live in Kunming , a city in Western China .
But now , with the economic development , everything has changed in this city .
This is terrible for the environment .
There were some training courses which anyone could join , for example yoga , dance and weight training .
Today I joined in with the boxing course .
I 've had no experience of it before .
Today , I watched TV at 10am .
The TV was showing a drama from Korea .
The drama 's title was `` On Air `` .
The drama of Korea had humor and interest for me .
She suffers from back - pain and ca n't sit for a long time in the car , therefore Kamakura is a reasonable place to visit .
Because it is only about a one hour drive from Tokyo .
Karamkura is an old city , and a famous tourist place .
In the morning , we had a walk on the beach together .
The hot summer . . . .
Have you ever seen a Sweet Osmanthus plant ?
It 's a flower that blooms in Japan in the Fall .
We call it `` Kinmokusei `` .
I like it not only because it is a beautiful flower but also because it smells good .
If you come to Japan in the Fall , please look for it .
To write an English diary is very hard , so I can only write a diary like a child .
I like to swim in my free time , I like swimming because it can make you have a good body and healthy body .
And I like to surf the internet too .
I like to chat with my friends .
Cherry blossoms are in full bloom now where I live .
I 'm looking forward to seeing it .
I think many people enjoy to see the cherry blossoms and walk in this season .
Somebody goes up then others go down .
That is the way of it .
Zhang , an e - mail and ask for his help .
But unfortunately I broke my leg when skiing in Switzerland so I ca n't return to Beijing in time .
I will really appreciate your help and I will return the favor sometime .
sincerely ,
I made a mistake .
I wanted to type `` 1 `` , but I typed `` l `` on my computer .
It 's difficult to distinguish `` 1 `` from `` l `` .
I think at first the content I write is n't so important .
It will soon be the end of the school year and thus there are exams . . .
In the English language for example .
If it 's not too hard please help me to correctly write an essay , perhaps something needs to be corrected .
A subculture is a group of people with a culture that differentiates them from the larger culture to which they belong .
For example , between music subcultures and there are conflicts based on different musical tastes .
about my career
I wrote that I 'm a civil engineer and I work for a construction firm in my diary before last week . ( I was too busy to write a diary for a week . )
Today I 'm going to write about my career .
I worked for Korea Highway Corperation , a public enterprise , for 13 years .
6 years ago I moved from KHC to a construction company .
While I was in KHC , I had supervised the designing of highway and construction work in the field .
Now I am doing business as a civil engineer .
Anyway thank you for reading and correcting this diary entry .
When I was thinking about authors who write books in beautiful
Japanese , I then thought about wanting to know authors who write books in beautiful
If you know any authors who write books in beautiful English ,
I 'm afraid I keep forgetting my English more and more , day by day .
Yes , I 've been forgetting English ,
because I got a job _ ( which I almost ca n't bear , this company is totally terrible ) .
And I do not need to speak , write , or read English in the company while I 'm working .
And I spend the whole time from 8 : 30 am to 11pm in my office without one penny of overtime pay .
Also there 's no English - speaking friend around me in Korea .
Even if I try to find language exchange , they think I 'm a boring and bothersome girl .
Because I 'm not really good at speaking English , nor do I really like drinking , smoking , or going to noisy places such as CLUBS .
BUT I 'm not BORING , NOR A PARTY POOPER .
I prefer home - - potluck parties or chatting and gossping over tea .
By the way , I do n't know what I 'll do to improve my English skill .
Friends in the University
Today , our class finished earlier than usual .
So we gathered at my house .
We enjoyed playing games .
I am refreshed .
Yeah , of course .
There were tons of Americans who hated lining up .
Today is June 24th .
Actually , I went to Starbucks before seeing this line and knew that
He was talking about its new features to his partner .
I could n't stop staring at the beautiful phone ,
that girl is staring like crazy ``
I could n't play innocent so I asked him where he got the beautiful phone .
`` I just lined up sweetie . ``
I just lined up since yesterday afternoon .
I know it was kind of unbecoming considering my age ``
And also other customers had a crush on it .
The man who has the iPhone4 was about 55 years old .
Though I am still not confident of my emglish speaking , I realized stronger and stornger that I should n't be afraid of making mistakes , and yes , as the words say . . `` Practice makes perfect `` , right ? wrong words
after the small group discussion , its surprising when someone came to me and told me `` your english is quite good ! `` . . wrong tense for the sentence
It 's so great to having this evening with those new friends and Ps . tense
Yeah , I think I am in a tough period on finding a job . . . . . preposition
but there are still lots of things waiting me to experience . preposition needed
I 'm Chinese .
I have been learning English since sixth grade , but I still am not very good .
On the night of the day before yesterday , I carelessly caught my foot on the cord , so that my PC monitor had fallen down from the table .
As a result , the screen broke .
I must now buy a new one .
Last time I saw a conversation between him and our host family .
At that time I was in the living room with our host .
We heard the `` sounds `` were coming from his room and it sounded like shaving sounds .
A couple of minutes later he came into the living room and we tried to teach him .
The host told to him when you use a razor , you must go to the wash room .
But he said `` I went there ! ``
And quickly became angry .
Of course our host was also angry because we knew that he had told a lie .
In fact he never apologized to our host .
We are not real family but our host treats me as a brother .
I always behave honestly because I living in his house .
Why did he have to tell a lie ?
He does n't seem to care about anything .
So we ca n't trust him .
After this happened our host said to me `` when you cook something , please cook for him . ``
Because if he uses the stove he 'll start a fire .
Meaning I can use the stove but he ca n't .
This morning something else happened .
He always sprays the water when he takes a shower .
After that I have to clean it because I do n't like it messy .
So I told him that when you spray the water you have to clean it .
I told to him how to clean it .
But he usually uses paper .
This time I asked him .
I know he uses paper everyday .
Why ca n't he tell me honestly .
Nowadays we have to think about our natural assets .
Because he is from Saudi Arabia .
I do n't want to discriminate .
Summer vacation End
I have summer vacation for 11 days .
It is too long for Japanese , to take a vacation .
Almost all business man men take about 4 days .
It looks long , but I have only 2 days left ! ! !
On monday , I have to work at the company ( I am the researcher and developer for novel food . )
are you enjoying your summer vacation ? ?
I 'm a Tanka poet ,
and I 'm learning Tanka with my friends , meeting once a month .
Tanka is also a form of poem ,
this October and November sometimes .
We have a meeting next Saturday
and it 's my turn to present on some Haiku poems at the meeting .
It is difficult for me to read Haiku
Take action ! !
I 'm a university student who is studying economics .
I began to participate in Lang - 8 in order to improve my English skill and to get in touch with a wide variety of people in the world . : )
I 'm looking forward to meeting all of the nice people in the world ! !
I believe that this whole swine flu panic is steered by the media to improve the economic situation .
In my opinion , everything that has happened is very artificial .
It was created to improve the sales of medicine and to get a `` kick `` for the pharmacy development of vaccines .
As well as to show people the importance of vaccinations and to persuade people to buy the vaccine .
All over the world much more people die because of standard flu but no one makes such a panic as the media did in the case of swine flu .
It is located about 3km from Mino Station .
Many people came there even though because of the chill I thought there would be only a few
A Japanese monkey appeared in front of us !
I saw this wild one for the first time .
Despite we were forbidden to feed them , someone gave the monkey a rice ball .
It 's not good .
I ate Kaisendon for my dinner , a ball of rice with some sea foods .
Today , let me tell you about the town I live in in Japan .
I live in Hayama .
This is a famous seaside town in Kanagawa prefecture next to Tokyo .
As the Japanese royal family has a summer house in the town ,
residents try to maintain its traditional landscape and cleanliness .
It 's a very small but beautiful town with alot of nature and many retirees .
Some Japanese office workers dream about living in the town because it does n't have a train station , hence it 's difficult to commute to business zones / districts such as those in Tokyo .
But I chose to live in Hayama despite the long commute time , I work in Shimbashi central of Tokyo .
It takes 1h 40m to commute .
I useally get on a train from Zushi station in the next town .
I spend the time reading newspapers , listening to English podcasts and sometimes , sleeping .
A letter to Brendan
Firstly , I saw some classmates who make some mistakes in diaries .
As known to us , the chinese hard to understand from some foreigner . As we all know
According to my family , he did n't suffer from much pain .
One of them is to eat my favorite Japanese foods .
I also ate ramen ( or Chinese noodle ) .
Ramen is originally from China but the Japanese changed its taste so that Japanese like it more .
Each Japanese local city has their own tastes .
Most local ramen can be also eaten in Tokyo .
We have lots of famous ramen restaurants in Japan .
Some of them run as chains and some of them are local .
It may not be so popular but I like it .
I went to some Yokohama ramen restaurants this time .
I will write down the list of good or famous ramen restaurants here .
Though I do n't know if ramen is popular among foreign people , I think you should really try it when you come to Japan .
I do n't know if these restaurants have web sites written in English .
Finally , I 'll attache the picture of ramen .
It was raining ( mixed with snow ) this morning in Tokyo .
It is likely to become cold tomorrow .
However , I love the snowy scene .
I joined this club today . my english is very bad so l hope to improve . I hope everyone can help me in this . thanks
Today , my pet Noel broke my phone .
I lost the phone cover . . . .
Where is my phone cover ! ? : - )
It also wo n't turn on .
I ca n't send any e - mail ,
make calls or use the internet .
I should go the phone shop tomorrow .
Today , I drank beer too much with my co - workers .
This Sunday , I attended my friend 's wedding in Chiba .
3 years ago , we had met at the cloth shop as a co - workers .
She was two years old younger than me but I really liked her and she also talked to me about almost everything .
We respected each other , I think .
But it was a hard year for her , some bad things happened again and again .
However she had overcome all of them by herself with having huge suffering .
She taught me the importance not to give up and we can get a happiness to keep trying .
Today , my son and I visited one of my fellow English - lovers to ( study ) / ( practice ) English .
After we studied English for 2 hours , she served us lunch .
: D To improve my English skills , I should keep learning in the hope that I will be able to achieve a breakthrough .
Although the Olympics closed yesterday , I 've been basking in the afterglow of that impression .
I 'm kind of a perfectionist and once I start a role playing game , I do n't stop it till I perfectly complete it .
It 's like an obligation to collect all the items that exist in the game and acquire all the abilities .
The FF4 DS has an auto battle system , so I have nothing to do during the battles .
While playing FF4 , I look at the websites that give me loads of information and yesterday I came across an English page with questions about FF4 on it .
Anyway , it 's time to go back to my journey .
and I received a reply :
As you ( might have ) understood , I misspelled spine .
Especially for the people who have a good sense of humour .
I want to work at UN to help poor and make the world more peaceful .
I would also like to be a psychologist .
Is it really hard to understand how people 's minds work ?
Some say it is the most difficult thing to major in .
I should study English harder .
My access count reached a thousand , although I do n't have that many friends .
Hope we can enjoy talking and exchanging information and opinions more !
The earthquake was a magnitude 7 . 1
Many buildings were damaged seriously but fortunately nobody died ; two people had significant injuries .
This was due to the damage the roads sustained , the power is down in most towns around Christchurch , the water supply has stopped and sewage as well .
Since this morning the TV is broadcasting latest news continually .
The prime minister is now on the way to Christchurch .
( sometimes ) I can see the damage on TV , and it is worse than I thought .
It seems that it will take a long time to recover from this .
Merry Christmas to teachers and friends ! ~ I wish my prayer will come true and everyone will receive it to have luck in life .

An increasing numbers of citizens , especially the young , are aking it seriously to celebrate it with their best friends or sweethearts .
Christmas should be given more attention for it will enhance our relationships with others who may have not so much time to keep in touch with us .
As the festival arrives , I will celebrate it with my friends for sure too .

And it seems an honor to me that I received an apple from my little sister .
How are you celebrating Christmas Day now ?

I drove to McDonald 's this evening
Because I wanted to eat a Texas Burger .
The Texas Burger was sold out .
So I ordered a Quarter Pounder instead .
The Quarter Pounder 's meat was bigger than a normal burger 's .
Next time I must eat / try the Texas Burger !

My Son 's Birthday
I came home early yesterday .
Children grow faster and faster by the year .
A little while ago , he could n't even put his socks on by himself .
But now he can put them on .
He seems to think for himself now and can choose what he wants .
Yesterday , I went to Baskin Robbins with my boyfriend
We had two small ice creams together .
In fact , I wanted to have the large ice cream but the small one was on sale , so we had the smaller and cheaper one .
Even though my bad tooth had sharp / piercing pains because of the cold icecream , we had enjoyable time there .
I used one piece of salmon , a potato , a carrot and half an onion .
First I fried the onion with some ginger and dry red pepper .
Then I added the potato , carrot and two spoons of curry sauce , and fried it a little bit more .
After that , I added the fish and some milk and stewed them for half an hour .
Finally , I placed some salt in it and the dish was ready .
I feel like a full Garfield right now .
25 years have passed since my house was built .
I like my house in that it is comfortable .
I 'm so relieved , I 'm really sleepy now .
And I 'm going to visit to Okinawa in March ! !
Everything .
A I think I am becoming a lazy person .
Every time I say that I am really busy because I have to prepare to get a job , I actually do not do anything .
From now on I will change and live like a very busy and passionate person ! ! !
I can say `` Today was my friends ' day ! `` because I visited the house of one of my English - lovers to chat away in English in the morning and I met some other friends with our kids to have lunch at a community center in the afternoon .
As for the chat meeting , a mom who is an organizer of another English club joined us this time .
After the meeting , I headed for a community center to have lunch with ( some ) other friends and our kids .
lol We rushed out of the room because we had to return the room key to the staff .
After the lunch , one of the friends invited me to have a few cups of coffee .
I hope my family will be able to have our own house in the future . . . . .
I 'm trying to make my circle of friends bigger and bigger .
my house phone has broken down
As it has been raining heavily since last night , my wife sent my sons and me to their school and my office by car this morning .
Thanks to her !
Before noon , I got a phone call from my house maker .
He said that he planned Nov 25th as the day of the finance loan .
I was so surprised since there was not enough time for me to prepare for some procedures .
I called the finance company and he said he was worried about the procedures too .
I asked my house maker and to change the day to Nov 30th .
My wife sent me an e - mail that our house phone with facsimile has broken down .
Since last week , the facsimile has been acting up .
Once she tried to turn off the power and turn it on again , it broke down !
So I will call the service center of the manufacturer tomorrow .
And I called my friend who was my alumnus and was a tax accountant .
I asked him about some tax problems .
But it was difficult to explain it on the phone , so I sent him an e - mail about it before this .
I understand that it is difficult to explain in writing , too !
Many Japanese people seem to be writing diaries about the snow .
I am worried about going safely to the company .
However , my daughter was happily playing in the snow .
My father and I have a common feature .
Furthermore , my mother told me that it was a good feature .
Continuing to do something is very wonderful .
* This diary continues from diary No . 1 .
As the boat arrived there , everyone went out the boat with their friends .
And I went out there by myself with my sad feelings .
At first , since I did not know Keelung , I went to the tourist information center .
And I was able to arrive there soon .
Before coming to Keelung , I heard the rumor about A City of Sadness .
The City of Sadness was famous for the taiwan movie 's stage .
I gave up it because it needed too much time .
If I went to there , I couldn ' thave gone to other famous places .
Next I asked her `` What places do you recommend in this city ? ``
She told me `` You could go to the Fairy Cave ? `` .
So I decided to go there .
to be continued . . .
My name 's Linh .
I 'm 20 years old and I 'm from Vietnam .
I 've been struggling to understand `` It `` and `` That `` .
I feel when I use `` It `` , `` It `` describes some kind of image .
It seems a long long way .
Some fancy thoughts to celebrate a birthday
I 'd like to share some strange thoughts with you on how I 'd like to organize a fancy party .
Let 's imagine I am planning a special birthday for myself .
When I celebrate my birthday , I will invite a lot of friends . I 'd also like to reserve a big , beautiful palace , far away from the country .
I 'd decorate it with special balloons with my name and the names of my family and friends on a balloon .
This birthday will have to be a special one .
When I invite my friends and they come over , an airplane will be waiting for them .
They will be served anything they want , as well as receiving their own special and expensive gifts that I have wanted to give them for a long time .
All this will take place after we view a fireworks display to start things off .
When the fireworks explode , it will spell my name and display my likeness in the night sky .
Finally , I would like for you to give me moral support .
I do n't need money or anything , but just a response as to what you think of my idea . Would you be satisfied with it ?
Lately , my company has decided that it needs to have a website created .
So far , we have only needed a static web site and not a dynamic one , so we do n't need a database .
I was interested in this new plan , although I knew that my skills at designing web sites ca n't be compared to that of a professional designer or engineer .
I still wanted to try , so I asked my friend to copy Windows server 2003 and Dreamweaver for me .
My plan is to design it using Dreamweaver , and when it is done , take it online using Server 2003 .
I hope that one day I can manage our server .
So after getting off work , I 'll go to my godfather 's noodles shop and then go to a library nearby to borrow related books .
And this can also eliminate what causes conflicts , such as misunderstanding about their customs ,
To tell the truth , l have n't read any books recently because l have been so busy recently .
wanted to teach precepts to his baby .
but his baby was so young . he had no time to wait for his baby to grow up .
and he determined that he will do `` The last concert `` for his young baby .
when after the baby has grown up , and after he died , he can still teach
his precepts to his children / child .
The last concert was so impressived to me .
especailly , the book made me think of a dream I forgot when I was young .
I toasted some bread with the toaster and I ate the bread without spreading anything on it .
The bread smelled good . & nbsp ; It was very crispy so I ended up eating all of the bread .
My son and daughter will have sports festival at their nursery school this Friday .
My husband , our parents , and I will go to cheer them .
I wish we have a clear sky !
My thinking at lest least diffrlent different .
Tomorrow we will get our first western culture exam .

Nara is covered by mountains and forests . About 77 % of it .
There are many shrines and temples there .
If you are sightseeing , please go to Nara Park first .
There are a lot of wild deer .
But if you walk in the park with food , please be careful .
Deer might attack you .
Todaiji is a very famous temple in Nara .
It 's a world heritage site .
Daibutsuden Hall is the world 's largest wooden structure ,
And there is a big Buddha statue there .
It 's about 15 m tall .
Kofukuji is also a world heritage site .

I 'll introduce you Nara 's trademark dishes .
Nara zuke pickles are
Various kinds of vegetables are pickled in a sakekasu . It has a little strong sake flavor .

reading the language ( grammar book ? ) and creating my diary .
I was on MSN for a long time with someone in USA .
I do n't know exactly when I can use `` any `` in sentence . I know it 's difficult to explain .
She sleeps too late .
She said this was because she usually read books .
She does n't like to eat breakfast in the morning before she goes to school .
and also lunch .
I asked her premis ( ? ) me to eat breakfast before going to school .
She said she premis ( ? ) eat breakfast in the morning .
I do n't understand some words and I have a talking dictionary but
I would like to throw it far away from me .
And I do n't want to open a dictionary anymore .
What I study at university is mainly subjects related to English , such as English linguistics , English education , American and British literature and so on .
I want to teach English to high school students preparing for university exams , so I 'm here to improve my English .
That 's why almost of the all English I write here is Japanese - English translation exercises made by universities in Japan , .

He sent me a text message one afternoon .
He set a date for 6 . 30 pm and asked me where I would like to meet .
We talked a lot about random topics during our dinner .
Such as his job , his landlord , pronouncing numbers in Chinese , my family heritage , my house , my cat , and others .
We also shared our thoughts about the correlation between money and happiness , freedom , and traveling .
That night meant something to me , because our conversations have moved from petty random topics to deeper subjects .
I felt some chemistry between us .
I would like to reciprocate by touching him back , but I could n't do that .
I am not sure that he really likes me or if he just wants to take advantage of me .
One thing for sure I enjoy his companionship .
`` The Devil wears Prada `` .
I am watching this movie at my home .

This morning , she came home from her morning exercise group in the neighborhood and said ,
I know it 's very , very inappropriate , but Mother 's remark remained in my ears all day and I had a very hard time trying not to burst into laughter .
New year 's day is already over as you and I know , but I still feel like I have n't regained the energy I had last year .
It may be because of the new year 's holidays , no , I kicked back too much during the holidays .
My energy level and enthusiasm might have fallen down while I was spending time on drinking and just watching TV .
Holidays sound really good to me , but it seems to be not good for my body . . .
Today I watched a program about Touhaku Hasegawa
He is one of the most famous Japanese painters
400 years have passed since his death .
and his exbition is held this year in KYOTO .
My mother tried to go there , but it is very popular and she had to wait in line for more than one or two hours . . .

lazy ivy says hellooooooo : (
However , I still forget or find any other excuse to being lazy .
It 's a real drawback of my personality .
`` The trouble with Ivy was that she never had a specific aim in life . ``
Because of the noise , I could n't record the latter part of the story during the daytime .
so I 'll do it this evening : )

It Is exactly 25 minutes before my birthday .
In the morning , there was seaweed soup for me , my mom made it .
I like the seaweed soup because it is so delicious to eat .
I went ahead and went to schoolin a good mood .
I Arrived at school and then open my locker to take out books , the moment I did not conceal surprises .
My birthday present was that my best friend gave my locker decorations .
That put up with tears .
Because it was the first such event in my life that made me happier
I have had expressed my gratitude to my friends . ( more natural )
So I sincerely congratulate my friends and be happy .
Today is the best day in my life .
I always will not forget this birthday .
But the reasons why we call him like that is because he is a bit short and he looks so cute like a Doremon .
He would think that we mocked him .
Thank you for reading my writing / entry .
cold weather
Today is Thursday .
The cold weather outside is making me cold .
Even though I 'm cold , I will do my best .
I broke up with my boyfriend . . .
One reason is that he wishes to work in China .
Another reason may be that there is another person between us .
In fact , I feel very sad , but I still need to work , eat , and so on .
Life is hard . .
I want new one !
Now I 'm growing some scallions , turnips , and lettuce .
Yesterday , I met a friend in our Lab who had graduated from the University .
I was very surprised and excited .
I think we 'll be very busy in the future , but I want to continue the relationship .
I hope he will work well .
There was the phrase `` This had better be good `` in a dialogue in my textbook .
When she tries explaining one issue , the sales director asks her to move on to the next topic because it was already mentioned in another person 's presentation .
Then her boss tells the sales director that she 's got some new ideas that are worth listening to .
And then the director tells her , `` OK , this better be good . `` , and she answers `` Right . ``
Then I walk around near the bus station wearingvolunteer clothes so that other people can obviously see me .
I feel very happy helping other people .
As we know , unordered phenomena can be seen everywhere in China , and I hope these situations will be changed .
and I hope our country becomes a beautiful one .
just like the slogan of the Shanghai Expo `` better city , better life `` .
Stuffing Your stomach With food is important to suppress the sensation of hunger .
You might think that you gain body weight if you eat a lot ,
yes , you are right .
But if you eat a high volume of low calorie foods , you will be satisfied with them without long term weight gain .
For example cabbage and lettuce have , respectively only 23 and 15 kcal per 100 g .
Even if 2 kg ( ! ) of lettuce is consumed , you will take in only 300 kcal which corresponds to 33 g of fat or the energy spent in just sitting for five fours .
Konjac and agar are primarily calorie - free and can be utilized to increase the volume of diets as can low calorie vegetables such as cabbage and lettuce .
Of course , if 2 kg of food or drink are consumed , there is a transient weight gain of 2 kg .
This is emphasized in episode of eating disorder ( ED ) patients , because they strongly fear gaining weight even if the weight gain is transient .
I think this one tastes good but my European friends do n't seem to like it that much .
They prefer beef to pork .
Anyway , when we got there , we were the only customers in this restaurant .
Now that was maybe because it was little bit early for dinner .
No matter what anyone tells us , we started drinking from 5PM .
After 2 hours , we had finished about 5 bottles of Soju which is a kind of traditional Korean alcohol .
Soju contains around 20 % alcohol , which means it 's pretty strong .
That 's why all of us got pretty drunk .
After wards , we went to China town where we drank more alcohol .
I totally blanked out so I could n't remember what was going on .
I must have dozed off for a while and then when I opened my eyes , I felt something strange .
Then I realized that I 'd passed 6 stations from where I was supposed to get off the train .
In the end , I had to call my cousin for him to give me a ride .
It was almost 2AM .
After I came to my sweet home ,
Things are looking up .
I go to the salon to change my hair style .
just as was expected , my hair designer was very kind .
After I tell the designer about what I want for a hair style , I do n't care while he is changing my hair style .
why do n't I care while he 's changing my hair style ?
because I believe ( trust ) him .
After finishing that , I was very happy .
because I was satisfied with my changed hair style .
Two weeks ago , I bought a bicycle machine which I can use in my place .
It 's one of the famous sporting goods for those people who do not go outside or register gym ( I corrected it because it was awkward ) .
I think there are a few advantages by using this ( machine ? ) .
First , it makes me to sweat easily than what I expect before and this means that it is also helpful as an aerobic exercise .
Actually , I will regret if I do n't go to gym after I register monthly membership
Although there are some [ abnormal ( awkward ) ] noises , when I pedal a bicycle , the overal result of using this bicycle is satisfying .
I was in the big earthquake with my daughters at home last Friday afternoon .
As soon as I felt the quake , we went under the table to protect our heads and opened the front door and window to get an escape route .
A lot of things fell down off of the shelves .
But I stopped them , because being outside would be more dangerous than being inside in Tokyo , where there are so many buildings .
That and my apartment is relatively new and earthquake - proof .
This is because the safeguard for the gas was working .
Fortunately , we could use water and electric power .
We ate instant needles by boiling the water with electric power .
Now , we can use gas again .
But some necessities for everyday life are lacking , such as toilet paper , tissues and dry batteries .
At last , I was able to buy toilet paper and dry batteries this morning .
I hope things will return to normal soon .
I 'm watching baseball on TV .
because this is a good game lasting over 5 hours .
It is fun for me whoever wins .
I went to Kyoto last weekend .
I went to Kamigamo - Shrine in Kyoto , Tentyuji - Temple , Seimei - Shrine , Arashiyama , Joujakkouji - Temple , Suzumusidera - Temple , Kamigamo restaurant and more . . . .
I put on a Yukata and rode on a jinrikisha at Arashiyama .
I will go there next Autumn .
I am refreshed . or : I feel refreshed
I have to walk outside this morning .
I will have to carry some luggage and I keep it from getting wet .
h Foreigners greet each other byshaking hands and huging , but Japanese do not have this custom . They hate any form of body contact .
I was really impressed by the Fireworks festival ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
I went to a fireworks festival yesterday .
It 's the first time that I have ever seen fireworks in that place .
Fireworks are beautiful and full of variety . . . .
the Anpanman , a figure of heart , a waterfall , and many other fantastic shapes .
I want to write about everything that impressed me .
And going to these events with a girl is really fun ! ( * ^ ^ * )
I came to Australia in August .
I 'm a waitress .
The shop / restaurant is in Chinatown .
I walk to work everyday .
It takes about 10 minutes .
I can eat anything for free ! ^ ^
World Economy Going Down ? ?
Because the Chinese government is raising the rate of interest , many small companies find it hard to borrow money .
What happens is they are stopping investment .
If China or other emerging countries like Brazil or India keep raising the rate of interest , I guess the recession will occur in the near future .
I love a comic series called Fullmetal Alchemist .
My most favorite character in the series is Roy Mustang .
You surely will come to like it , too .
This is a give - away toy presented by `` Mister Donut `` .
He has been together with me for five years .
It is my first time writing an English article .
Maybe my heart is afraid or nervous .
Besides , my major is not Chinese .
I quitmy job a month ago because I hated being an Admin Assistant .
I like studying languages , helping people can make me feel happy .
Oh , but it 's not easy for me to find this kind of job , and sometimes I feel confusing .
Who can help me ?
My friends suggested they would put cement tiles on my kitchen wall . They then asked which color I liked more from / out of gray , white and beige .
I answered white would be great but not to rush cause we may have to move out this month .
She said that `` someone will quit their job on the 20th of August in Mori bud in Akasaka .
And everyone wants you back over there , can you do it ? ? ? ``
Actually I quit the job last year , but at my last job I was always thinking how nice it was to work in Tokyo .
I really enjoyed working over there .
Even my sister said to me , `` You should go back to the job ! ! I I 'm 200 % sure of it ! !
At times likethese , I make sure to eat something that will put me to sleep as soon as I lie down .

Hello
everyone ! !
I have been auctioning items on the Internet since last year .
The reason why I started this auction is

But now , it became a very important source of income for me .
Have you experienced auctioning on the Internet ?
I felt this movie is something even adult should see .
At the moment 3D movies are hot in Japan .
I 've been exhausted the past few days .
I think it is stress caused by the terrible earthquake .
But I think I should have a more positive attitude .
Upon seeing what I bought , my little son looked disappointed because I bought more clothes for his elder brother and did n't buy shorts for him which I told him that I would buy one for him .
Many animals have lost their own habitats !
Lately in Korea many enviornmental problems have occured becuase of Four River Project .
the government said it will be helpful to Korea 's economy .
But many people did not agree with the government because they think it will be useless .
The government also says that this will become a tourist attraction , but it will not .
They destroyed famous places with great natural landscapes and also drove many animals and plants from their own habitats .
The government did not care about the people 's complaints because of the benefits .
I want more people in the world to know about this and become interested in it .
Right now I 'm listening to Smokie 's `` Living next to door Alice `` .
As I did n't know the meaning of the lyrics , I was sad for no reason .
After knowing the meaning of the lyrics , I feel so sad .
When I feel a little blue , I listen to sad songs like this .
* If you want to listen to the music

We call the year - end party bonenkai .
So a bonenkai is a party for forgetting the past year .
We forget the troubles of the past year , and we start the new year .
This time I will try to read this book in English .
Haruki Murakami is one of the famous Japanese writers in Europe but I think that it is difficult to translate his works because his way of writing novels is really abstract and is n't obvious .
When he got the Franz Kafka prize in 2006 , he quoted a sentence from the letter of Franz Kafka to his friend .
We have two main purposes in going to Hokkaido ; one purpose was , of course , to go sightseeing , and the other was to go to the Fujifabric concerts .
This is the second time I went to Hokkaido in my life , and when I went to Hokkaido two years ago for the first time , I went with exactly the same friends with the same purpose !
The concerts were great ( we went to two concerts , both held in Sapporo ) and we ate many delicious meals including sushi , curry and noodles , and bought many souvenirs .
This time , we went to Otaru , which is about a one - hour train ride northwest of Sapporo .
The main street was crowded with so many tourists , who came from home and abroad .
The town has a unique atmosphere with a lot of nostalgic buildings so no wonder so many people are attracted to the town .
It was early October and just starting to become chilly , but not too cold as one might expect .

Before I took the class , I only read my vocabulary notebook for about three times a week , but I learned many strategies in how to expand my vocabulary in my university .
For example , making up sentences containing new words , using a website , keeping a diary , and so on .
It increases my confidence very much .
Moreover , I put vocabulary tags on my funiture .
I 'm a little bit shy .
It is a good chance of changing my personality .
I 've been slacking on my studies for several months
When I heard about how I can put some messages and comments on lang - 8 with my cell phone , I want study English again .
And I 'm hoping to improve my English skill .
I 'll read as many English books as I can .
Movies as a Learning Medium
The debut film of director Quentin Tarantino .
A group of men in tuxedos are ordered to rob a diamond store .
Before doing the heist these men gathered at a round table playing cards inside a small restaurant .
The characters begin their chat by discussing Madonna 's song `` Like A Virgin `` .
They try to interpret the song .
In the end of the discussion , one by one they threw money in an upside down hat which was used to collected the money .
He criticizes the concept of tipping .
He disagrees to give a tip to a waitress because society tells him to .
I agree with him because some rules in the society are made to please a group of people , and this group is expecting other groups to agree with them .
Unless someone is part of the group , the rule does n't apply .
Tarantino brilliantly criticizes it in his movie through Mr .
Pink .
Beside Tarantino I love watching historical dramas or movies about specific time period .
Ironically , these kind of movies are n't always historically accurate .
For the sake of dramatic and artistic license , the film makers make up their own version of history .
After watching a historical movie I always check Wikipedia to crosscheck the historical information .
This is my first diary entry .
I joined this service five minutes ago .
My wife and I watched `` Biohazard . ``
In the movie , the main character , acted by Milla Jovovich , tried to help people who could not leave a building because there were many undead outside .
We were really excited about the story but sometimes were not able to look at the screen because there were some grotesque scenes .
After watching the movie , we went to a book store and bought a book that teaches the English alphabet to children .
Actually , my wife is pregnant and we preparing for my children .
We came back to our hometown and went to an Indian restaurant that we had never been to .
We were astonished because , in Japan , there are not so many foreign restaurants which last over five years .
After eating , we promised that we would come here again .
Please correct my diary entry .
Actually , I studied English in another way but I think the most important thing is to convey your thoughts in the language you want to .
And it 's better to get it corrected by native speakers and to study from there / analyze the corections .
I realized again how comforting it is to be with them . : D
It is also nice to be with the girl that I 've loved for a long while but this ambiguous relationship is now straining my heart a little .
Last Sunday I went out on a date with her , but when I was with her I could n't be
my normal self xD .
I want to feel relax when I am besidenext to her ! !
I am a not lazy mother I think , but sometimes I am selfish .
So I have plenty of time to do anything I want .
That one is called Seven Pounds
I still ca n't describe these movies in English , but I had a good time watching them , and I also learnt some new words and some phrases from the movies .
I might have been stuck in the house because of the snow if I woke up little bit later .
I came to my office before it started snowing heavily .
I think I 'm lucky because it 'll be hard to come here because of snow tomorrow .
Snow causes many traffic delays here because it does n't often snow .
When I was a child , . ( I was happy when it snowed )
But it is good for me that it snows because I can enjoy fantastic scenery .
`` The Coming of Spring ``
This morning , I was walking to the supermarket nearby my house .
While walking , I noticed the leaves on the trees were budding and were preparing for the coming spring , even though the weather was cold and rough .
That made me feel refreshed and happy , and I realized that I could n't afford to pay attention to these kind of nice littlenice things
I went on a trip with teachers yesterday .
At Showa no machi , they represented the showa period , so I felt a good old memory rush into my mind .
That 's why sometimes I want to give up but my conscience does n't let me do this , even because I will need it while living here .
Today one question in English came up to my mind .
Thanks !
Che Guevara
I watched movie about the life of Che Guevara .
I was impressed with his mind and respected his actions .
His birthday is same as mine .
I 'm attracted to him .
I still have n't read it yet .
My name is Matthiaire .
But I am born and bred Japanese .
So this name is a nickname for the internet .
I write poor English , so please teach me English .

I guess you could call me ( a ) `` Germinese , `` but please do n't call me Chimany ; it reminds me of the word `` chimney . ``
All joking aside , although I do n't really need to learn English for the time being , I ( do ) believe that English is a must for people living in this globalized world .
So please help me brush up on my english !
I 'm embarrassed about this .
This is very common in Japan .
Even on TV shows this is a common theme .
Is it the same as in Japan ?
If you do n't mind , please share with me .
The typhoon is coming to Japan now .

And they will be become parents of a boy !
I want to be able to speak English well !
What is your hobby ?
My hobby is playing the guitar .
Last night I saw a movie , which title is `` Up In The Air `` .
The movie had a very moving story .
I think it is important to have friends , lovers , and family .
In movie , there is such question that one of the characters asks :
When I think about it there are many people around me ,
that are always supporting me .
Which is why I feel happy today .
I think I am more thankful for my friends , lover , and family because of the movie .
We have our first wedding anniversary on the February 14th .
It is Monday , so we have a small home party on Sunday , 13th .
My parents and my aunt will come to our house for lunch to celebrate us .
Who is my true self ?
So , there are things we dislike ; nonetheless , we tend to say `` I like that `` .
If something is a secret , you ca n't tell your friends . : )
What should I do ?
What can Ido ?
Why ca n't we just tell the truth about things .
So now the only thing we can do is keep our fingers crossed !
I live with my housemate , named Ena .
She immigrated from Korea to America 15 years ago .
When I came to the USA , I was looking for housing .
So I found Ena 's apartment on the internet .
After talking with her , I moved into this place .
When I arrived to this apartment , I had forgotten that she has 3 daughters called Mina , Tali , and Mira .
I think Mina looks like her father , but I 'm not sure because she does n't look like Ena .
She is a bit stubborn , but very sweet , outgoing , and smart .
Mira is 4 years old , but she is a very hard ( ? ) girl .
I have never met a girl like this before .
Sometime she is very lovely when I give her some chocolates .
Sometime I 'm thinking like that . ( unclear sentence )
If I refused to live with her daughters , my life in San Francisco would have been very different .
: ) The first month , when I started to live with them , I felt very nervous and stressed .
But now , I can feel comfortable and I know how put myself into another 's place .
Is this correct : ' Analysis on an Early Modern English Play ' ?
The earthquakes scare me , but I can stay in my home at least .
I even have water supply and electricity supply since last night .
The danger of a nuclear disaster also makes me horrified .
I do n't have much information or knowledge about it .
I went to see a lot of cherry trees in Osaka about seven years ago .
There is a famous place to see them in Osaka called ZOUHEIKYOKU .
There was a street about 100 meters long and various cherry trees lined up on both sides of it .
It was really beautiful !
I 'd never known that there were so many kinds of cherry blossoms . I 'd never seen green ones in my life before .
That was very surprising to me .
I want to go somewhere special for to see cherry blossoms this year too .
Thesedays some of my coworkers have got colds and wear masks .
Let me count . . . there is my boss , team member ( he 's absent today ) and three other cowerkers . . almost one third of my section .
I guess it 's spreading quicker than the past years because I 've never seen such a scene .
If you live in Japane , pay attention to your health .
I 'm breaking my record of keeping good health for at least two years : )
I did n't understand the content of the movie very much when I watched the movie for the first time because I was worse at English then .
Crimson clouds
Crimson clouds are really beautiful .
My mother and I took a walk this evening .
And the sky 's colour was reflected on the lake .
Lots of people who were playing outdoors said that this kind of scenery was really beautiful .
I took a picture of the clouds
I have n't used English for a long time .
I think I forgot all of the grammar and vocabulary .
So , If I have time then I will try to write my diary in English .
The soccer match between Korea and Japan is starting now .
Korea and Japan have been soccer rivals for a long time . This sounds more natural .
We bet on how our team will score a goal with the money that paid for the drinks .
A few minutes ago , I was talking with my girlfriend .
I had n't spoken with her in 2 weeks .
So it was really nice ! ! ! !
However , waking up early is one of her weak points ! !
But you know , I 'm so lazy ~ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

Osechi ! ! ( A Japanese traditional dish )
I sold Osechi .
there were many kinds of Osechi .
For example , Datemaki , Kuromame , Kurikinton etc .
Japanese people usually eat it on January 1st .
The purpose of my part time job for me was to eat the most delicious dish in the cafeteria .
Today , I ate the Bibinba set !
It was delicious and its cost was low : 380yen .
I enjoyed my part time job !
I have been learning English in school since I was five , so I should be really good at it .
I thought that now is the rainy season in NY as well as in Japan .
But , my colleague told me that there is not a rainy season in NY and the weather this year is unlike the usual in NY .
I felt the climate in Japan was getting warmer and warmer in several years .
I wondered if Japan became a part of Southeast Asia in a respect .
We can see extraordinary climate in every area across the globe .
It 's time to seriously take into consideration this environmental issue .
Hello , everyone ! My foreign language teacher told me about this site . I had hardly opened my laptop when I came back home and made my first diary entry . I hope I can make more new friends from around the world .
Why the child likes sand ?
This sentense explains the children ` s liking .
All of my three daughters like sand and they play with it .
Especially , the minute and smooth ones .
I was given many feasts like a sand rice ball , a sand pancake , a sand juice , a sand meat , , etc .
I think that they feel a special value about sands .
I can not relate because I am an elderly man .
How to improve listening skills
It 's very funny to me .

I ca n't come back to a fact of life . ? ? ?
lol My arms are sore because I was waving penlight a lot .
this morning , I knew that Budweiser had gotten bought out by Inbev two years ago .
At first , I guess that Lehman shock caused a buyout .
But , the buyout happened on the 15th of July , then Lehman shock happened on the 15th of September .
According to NPR , the stock Bud owned were so few ( only 4 % ) that they could n't keep themselves .
It 's a pleasantly surprise for parents when they see a newborn .
As science keeps improving , more and more premature babies suvive with the help of drugs , incubators , oxygen etc .
But people may not know that with a premature body , the baby may get NRDS , ROP , NEC and a lot of complications .
But you may not experience joy like that if a dying baby had not been rescued and grew larger .

Her assistant , Mai , is also a beautiful woman and her smile is so cute .

I may have a business trip to Colorado , America , and Montreal , Canada .
When I went America last summer , I had a chance to make a presentation to them in English .
But I could n't understand what they advised me to do .
At the time , I could n't say `` I ca n't understand what you are talking about `` and ask `` Can I ask what you mean ? `` .
I communicated with native speakers .
Could you speak more slowly with using easier phrases ?
If I can go there , it would be good opportunity to improve my English .
For example I practice singing a song for December 21 live .
I 'm singing an animation song and some of my favorite songs .

Yesterday 's movie is about when Shakespeare wrote `` Romeo and Juliet `` .
He had a very sad love
when writing `` Romeo and juliet `` .

Because I understand that Shakespere has Romeo 's feelings .
So Shakespeare wrote a passionate love .
Today is very sunny day !
It looks very delicious ,
I 'm working as a doctor , and studying in a graduate school of a university in Japan .

It 's still hot today .

I 'm waiting for a reply .
By the way , _ I was very angry at Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara !
He said the tsunami is retribution against Japan .
How could he say that ? _ _ I ca n't believe him !
I will probably continue to look for a part - time job tomorrow .
I write my thoughts and feelings on a Network Notpad ,
However , in the next refresh ,
When I had just finished my diary , the network went down and l lost my notes , omg !
But more importantly is this ,
The page is closed suddenly !
I started piano last September at community college , and finished beginner 's class last month .
It was very hard for me to finish this course at the end , since I did n't have any experience of playing piano before .
I do n't want to have a hassle and hectic days anymore , so decided to take this class just once a week .
And it just started today .
I will just keep up my piano practice for fun .
Yesterday , my sister studied hard .
She has exams today .
An hour after she began to study math , she asked .
`` Nao , I could n't solve this question .
Can you teach me ? ``
It 's very difficult !
But I 'm surprised that I forgot this .
And I knew that stuff again .
Another wasted day . .
I do nothing except surf the net and rest , but I have four exams coming ! ! ! !
Second , the job needs to fulfill me since I do n't want to feel like I 'm wasting my time just to make money .
I have to be careful about figuring out my job and the way to achieve my dream , because it is not like I 'm very young , or like I have many options ( since I do n't have enough money ) .
So I will try to do my best to find my way and achieve my dream , rather than being frustrated about my poor situation .
In my last post , I wrote about LFs and LR .
Another point of view : all kinds ( types ? ) of relationships are based on it .
Business is based on the will for making money .
There are many other examples , but there is one simple conclusion - different relationshp may be based on different things , but only communication is means for establishing a relationship .
Our relationships are based on my love for soft and fluffy and his will to eat .
Nabe is a traditional dish in Japan .
It is very simple cooking . .
There are various flavors such as Kimchi ( Korean taste ) , Miso , Soy Sauce , Salt , Curry , and so on .
It is especially eaten in winter because it warms our bodies up .
I was looking for sandals .
But , eventually I could 't buy the sandals that I liked .
I will try to looking for cute sandals tommorow .
Today I woke up 3 : 00 AM , so that I could enjoy the soccer game on tv .
Honda is an honorable Japanese .
When I was elementary school , ALT teacher from Australia showed us pictures of Australian nature , sea , koalas and so on in his class .
Recently , Japan has been developing and many buildings have been built , and we can not see the nature in Japan because the amount of it is decreasing .
And I have never gone abroad and see the scenery apart from Japan .
So I saw such a scenery of picture for the first time and
I thought it looked like a different world .
After the class , I want to live in Australia .
It is generally believed that ( the ) Japanese ( language ) does n't have articles .
Today I will review about the usage of articles .
* I visited a town which is famous for being a hot spring resort .
The town in this sentence is one of several famous towns .
In this case , this is the only famous town that exists ( in the region ) .
In addition , the word `` article `` itself is puzzling too .
Whenever I see this word , I think of a newspaper article .
Unfortunately , I have n't finished all of my workload this week .
So I 'll be forced to be on duty tomorrow .
I apologize to you for the short notice
Today is the day that Japan lost the war against America .
On 15 , August , 1945 , Japan lost the war against America .
I know it was foolish of Japan to fight against America .
We could not win against America because our technology was poor .
We must acknowledge our failure : we lost the war .
But I believe we failed in another way , too .
After the war , we succeeded in strengthening the economy and gaining better living standards .
We longed for Western life and our culture was Westernized .
But now we have lost our Japanese IDENTITY and CULTURE .
You can imagine what I mean by Japanese culture .
Of course , Kabuki , Waka , Samurai , Yamato , Wabi Sabi and so on .
But modern Japanese people do n't watch Kabuki , sing Waka and Haiku , or watch Samurai .
Nowadays , our lifestyle is Westenized : we have lost Japanese culture .
We are not Japanese . More precisely , we are not what we used to be .
In ' The Last Samurai ' , which stars Tom Cruise , this idea is the subject .
Aftrer the war , we succeeded economically , but we lost our culture .
Our economy is not strong anymore .
I believe this is the best chance for Japanese people to regain our identity and culture and to work together .
It 's gorgeous .
Even though I bought it only 500 yen ( about $ 5 ) ,
I ca n't believe its price is only a small amount .
In my opinion , famous French wine or something of the like is not equal to its costs .
I think their value does not justify the selling price .
I love Australian & American wine too . There are a number of good wines that I 'm capable of buying , given I do n't have too much money since I 'm so young .
Hey , please can anyone tell me how good French wine is !
I usually listen to the English conversation program or watch English TV drama with PSP ( PSP stands for Play Station Portable ) on the train .
I went to Costco with my friends a few days before .
My friend recommended Cheerios to me .
And I found out something wonderful when I went to pay for the cereal :
chocolate chunk ( cookies ? ) .
It was similar to the cookies made by my ( ? ) teachers .
I love my teachers ' handmade cookies .
I tasted them at the Christmas bake sale at my high school .
Teachers made cookies and sold them .
tuition .
I picked up my husband this morning .
I thought it would be easy to get there , because today is Saturday .
But there was a lot of traffic , , , , I hate traffic .
After lunch , I went to the official kids playground but it was closed , too bad .
So I played with my sweet daughter in front of my house .
We take a walk a little , then I heard dog 's bark .
and I saw a boy , standing beside the waterway .
I could not believe my eyes .
There was a dog , that was very old and skinny .
I was holding my daugter so I could not help .
I called out to my husband to help the dog .
Suddenly one man came and helped .
He picked up the dog but the dog fell through his fingers again .
He picked it up again and took it to some house in the distance .
I do not know what happened afterwards .
I hope to the dog can be reunited with its owner back at his ( her ) house .

There 's some funny things happening in my life ~
Acturally , I sat on the floor all night to write this blog . I wrote the diary and ask friend how to translate it into English . ~ * * ~ It makes me scattered ~ phrases like `` bustling street `` or `` press the bus bell `` .
@ @ I also changed jobs .
I forgot if I wrote that on my last essay or not ? ?
My job is not so great .
There are too many stores nearby .
There is a gold accessories store next to my store and opposite to Boost .
It 's a good in a way that Boost is next to my store , so that some customers go to see my products when they are waiting for drinks or friends .
Or some customers might say something that means they want to have a discount .
And that kind of situation is just like business in the market in my country .
I never think that will happen in other countries , especially in the white people 's world .
In my opinion , they often buy products in stores directly and they do n't bargain .
Bargaining is too tiring for me ~ XD
In the end , I will work hard to do my job .
My friend told me there is another job with more money to earn ! ! ! ~ ^ ^ ~ YA ~
In a dialogue I studied the other day , there was a sentence `` why , thank you . `` Someone praised a dress that one woman was wearing .
I heard it for the first time and felt it sounded strange .
It 's secret for now .
Actually , I want to work and earn money ,
because I have a lot of things that I want to do and want to buy .
So today I will go to an interview .
Probably , you know of it .
I have been wanting to get a single - lens reflex camera for a long time .
Dreaming about the future is interesting .
Please cheer me on !
Although no one corrected my diary , I corrected someone 's Japanese .
This is my first entry on Lang - 8 .
I do n't even know what to write .
I 'm a 24 - year - old girl , born and raised in a tiny suburb town in Japan .
I lived with my family till 19 and left to the states to study whatever .
I was looking down on all the typical college kids in Japan when I was 18 I guess .
souvenir . .
Next month , I 'll go to school in Boston for two weeks to study English , and visit New York for 4 days for sightseeing .
I want to bring souvenirs for my host families .
I happened to notice the song `` do n't know why `` sung by Norah Jones was also sung by an English singer named Joni Keen .
I felt there was a distinct difference between Norah Jones and Joni Keen while I was listening to it .
Especially the melody of the piano , it is enough to get my baby erect .
I tried to look for the URL that contains this song so all of you reading my article could listen to it ,
but it 's hard to look for .
if you wanna listen to this song , send me a request to send it by email .
Yes , the title of my note is banal , but I can not invent anything better .
First , I want to tell you some general facts about me .
I ` m a russian girl who live in the south of Russia , in the region of Krasnodar , in the small town of Kropotkin .
I play guitar , watch anime ( yes , I ` m one of _ them _ > _ > ) , and learn English .
I want to become an Orientalist one day .
So I must pass an / the English exam , but my knowledge of standard English is not very high .
And what more can I tell you ?
I can not think of anything else now .
Did I make some mistakes in this text ? *
It tasted good except for the stew
The viewpoint of speaker is that all faculty should work outside the university in a profession relevant to the courses they teach .
On one hand , professors who work outside will know which technology is more useful in factual projects .
There are so many theories in one academic field . For example , in software engineering , both Java and C + + are very useful programming languages .
Professors should pick one language to teach to give the students a better understanding of the material .
In China , C + + is used more frequently than Java ; consequently , teachers should pay more attention to C + + .
Students who learn more useful technology will have a big advantage in finding a job .
In addition , working outside will give professors a better understanding of their ownfield .
In some circumstances , theories in textbooks are no use in real life .
However , a professor who has that experience may not agree if the faster one costs too much more than the other .
The teachings of each of these teachers will differ greatly , and the latter is more useful to students .
Nevertheless , not all courses are studied for practical use , such as algebra ; one might not find a job based solely on math .
Moreover , it is better studied on campus , in a lab , not in a company ,
because there may not be a project to use it directly .
As a result , these professors should not waste time finding jobs .
As Bertuard Russell said , `` Experience without learning is better than learing without experience . ``
Every professor in a field that offers the opportunity to work outside , should ; the others may stay on campus .
For students ' futures , universities should find more opportunities to give their professors .
In that way , both professors ' and students ' capacities will improve .
I 've finally finished all my work for the week today .
Although I 'm exhausted and sleepy , I 'm looking forward to going to my niece 's birthday party tomorrow .
But before the party , I 'll try to get plenty of sleep .
Hi , my name 's Marco .
I am from Italy and I 'm 17 years old .
It 's happy day today because Google Blogger is back !
But , I lost 2 articles ; What a great company .
I do n't want anymore problems , Google : (
Hello ! I 'm from The White House .
Sorry , It 's a Japanese joke . . .
And I am working in company that is located close to Osaka Tenmangu ( a Shinto Shrine in Osaka ) .
How does the Japanese accent sound ?
Japanese people tend to have a strong accent , but that seems to be okay for girls , because it somehow sounds cute .
But what about guys ?
Asian Cup tonight
The world may not care for this , but there is a big game on tonight .
It is a football game final between Japan and Australia .
I wonder why the Aussies are in Asia .
Well , it 's OK because we 've got more good teams in the Asian Cup .
They are big and strong . Also many of them play abroad .
Okay , I 'll have to stop writing this .
Yes , I 'm thin - skined .
The Chinese Mir Wei , 43 years old , was upset with a police action in Hechi , China , and protested getting naked and climbing over a high tension wire .
I wanna have some friends from other countries on facebook because I have no one yet .
Please , anyone who can speak English even a little , add me .
I want to practice English by writing and chatting more with you at facebook .
And anyone who wants to learn Thai or has a question about it , you can feel free to ask me but you have to use English at an intermediate level because I can only use this , or if you are good at Thai and wanna talk with me in Thai , that 's ok .
Please leave your E - mail here or add me at facebook by this email : mumagagi @ hotmail .
More Friends means More Fun
I do n't have anything scheduled today .
I went to Nagaokakyo city in Kyoto today .
The purpose was buying famous baked pork .
When I watched a TV program , I knew the store .
I searchedthrough the internet and discovered that
many people loved its baked pork .
However , yesterday , when I browsed the internet , I found a
blog that it is closed until April .
`` Sorry , we are closed until April for renewal . ``
I can not be here in Kyoto in April because of my job .
I want to go somewhere on this holiday .
But , I have nothing scheduled today .
I know that I have to study English and other things .
I am writing my first diary entry now .
Today , I played the flute at school .
I had breakfast and I went to school .
I like the members of my brassband !
First of all , the difference of traffic rules between US and Japan is .
I felt the roads are not paved well compared to Japan .
Finally , is the driving manners .
I thanked God for my arrival to the hotel without any accident .
I breathe deeply to let the soothing scent of wet earth into my lungs along with the rather cold and wet breeze that touches my face .
My hands get cold before other 's hands do , usually .
The rotting boards are making their final attempt to hold each other .
From between them a big garden could be seen , many wild plants are living with the garden trees now , which I do n't suppose was allowed when humans were living here .
This crowded garden is that tallest pine tree 's birthplace .
Nasrin points to some crows singing and dancing together over a pistachio tree in the night dresses they always wear .
Wo n't we be all so sad if we do n't hear the crows ' message of the start of a new season ?
Today I 'll tell you about my scheduled trip to Tokyo .
So I 'll leave him to let him sleep well that night .
We 'll enjoy Nakamise street , a pedestrian mall leading to Senso - ji Temple from the Kaminari - mon .
We 'll find many small shops which sell traditional Japanese items and food , lined up on both sides of the street .
I went to prepare for `` Yomise `` this morning .
Today itwas very hot and humid .
I worried about getting aheat stroke .
I was very tired because of the heat .
This picture is of `` Chamusume `` who assisted inserving cold green tea last year .
Yesterday there was a TV program on Al - Jazeerah - Children channel , in each episode of this program they host a child or teenager and let him live his dream job , and meet someone works in the same job .
In yesterdays episode , they hosted a girl , that / who can speak Arabic and French . he dreams to work as an `` Interpreter `` . She met someone who works as an `` Interpreter `` ; a person who translates from one language to other instantly . This person works for the United Nations and translates speeches in the sessions .
They show how this job is very difficult , because the interpreter should listen , think of the meaning , speak and listen to the next sentence at the same time without any mistakes .
They also show how this interpreter ca n't work for more than 30 minutes , because this job needs a lot of concentration , and he should have a rest every half hour .
The girl did a great job in translation , and I think she would be a good interpreter in the future .
Today it is Saturday , December 11 .
I 'll make myself breakfast now .
I 'm going to make toast , a fried egg and potato salad .
My two children like to crack an eggshell , but they sometimes fail and make a mess .
It 's just 10 days this year .
Recently , I 'm ( making ) a New Year 's card design .
But , I could n't think of a nice design .
Because , next year is the tiger in Chinese astrology .
By the way , I heard new year is different in some countries .
's ( Japan 's ) new year is on January .
( Chinese ) new year is on February .
Indian and Bangladeshi new year are on April .
When is the coming of a new year in your country ?
Through writing it , I found out that one of the name 's origins is related to the name of the job .
Today , I worked on my graduation report .
I read some articles to get useful information .
I think `` The Name `` has some effect on people 's lives .
So I 'm going to name my future son . . .
I watched the rest of `` 24 season 6 `` .
I 'll be able to catch up to the latest season within this year .
In that drama , many short responses are used repeatedly in conversation .
However , some phrases are very common in daily conversation , such as the phrases the civilians use in conversations before being involved in a crime , the phrases used in the meetings in the White House , and so on .
I heard the phrase , `` What are you talking about ? `` in many scenes .
So I have been stuck at home .
It will be cold for the next three days .
I will stay at home each of these days with a book to read .
Our department will hold a drinking party today .
I 'm a light drinker and I do n't like alcohol .
So , I do n't like a drinking party very much .
I learned some words and expressions yesterday and I 'll try to write some short sentences .
( 1 ) I went out with an umbrella this morning because the weather forecast said that there would be the chance of showers in the evening .
( 3 ) To prove that the machine did n't have any defects , the engineer brought it to a halt for three days and checked it thoroughly .
( 5 ) Who could anticipate an increase in emission of pollutants .
( 6 ) You are eligible for getting a special discount provided you bring the card we sent last week .
Well , I 'll try to write a diary containing more words than the Twitter 's character limit .
For English followers , my Twitter ID is `` akari131 `` . .
It 's `` kunipen `` .
If you find me on Twitter , please follow me .
Today I woke up with a smile .
Today I had breakfast with a spoon .
Today I took a bath with soap .
Today I went out with my parents , then had dinner with them .
Today I am very happy .
Recently I saw this .
Actually South Korean people usually are n't interested about / in North Korea .
Of course , some people in / from NGOs , human rights organizations & churches are concerned about North Korea .
actually I did n't know about my blood relatives before I saw it .
I do n't think that the movie tells us everything .
that 's going too far , to say the least . . .
The story is about a North Korean man .
He had a family : a wife and a kid .
One day his wife was sick , but the man could n't find medicine .
They just had just a little corn flour and his wife was dying .
So , he decided to go to China and go back to North Korea after finding some medicine .
The next ( part of the ) story is . .
the contents are good .
it 's a very sad story .
the global news said to us ,
And the movie story is just one among many others .
I cried a few times when ( while ) I was watching the movie .
Thinking that if I was the man who had a sick wife but could n't find the medicine and the food was decreasing . . .
North Korea and China are very friendly
But , if a North Korean person is detected by the police of China or North Korea crossing the border , 8 of 10 are killed .
by the goverment .
Even though people try to escape from North Korea . . .
They risk everything because they just want to live .
Big Sale
I wanted a summer jacket so my wife and I went to a big sale .
I chose from many jackets . Finally , I bought two jackets .
One was a navy blue and the other was a checkered .
I liked these so much .
My wife got many clothes which she likes .
We had fun shopping today .
Last week I went on a business trip to London .
It was snowing .
During my business trip , I visited the Tate Modern and I bought a T - shirt .
Some persons said that Britain food is not tasty .
However I do n't think so .
In Tokyo I have found a lot of matters by the Tohoku Kanto serious disaster .
1 , we can save electricity , therefore we had spend much power . ( For example , people of the same family can work in the same room so that they can save energy . )
2 , I have got chances to help my family , and communicating with my family has grown much more than ever before .
3 , I found that my personal security I have to protect my myself , but I should cooperate people
4 , A lot of information has confused us , thus I always have to think what I need important information .
5 , I ` m more active , because God helped us .
So I think I will face many big problems in the future , but I believe I can overcome them .
Now , I ` m concerned about the water problem : water in the Kanto region has gradually become contaminated by Fukushima Daiichi NPP .
Tokyo and some regions are safe .
The Climb
The song make me remember my life , my faith is shaking , feels lost with no direction .
`` But I got ta keep trying .
Have I told youthat I keep a cat ?
It 's really cute , show it to you , my friend .
It 's very humid today . There is no wind and I want to do nothing
My skin is sticky all over .
I can ' t wait !
Tonight is going to be a big night for Japan .
I ca n't wait to watch that , either ! !
I 'm looking forward to that .
I am worried about making friends .
I 'll always smile tomorrow : )
Everything will be OK !
My professor asked us to go to a few writing workshops and she would give us extra 5 points for every workshop we attend .
Becuse I had another appointment that finished at the same time as the workshop started .
Recently , I 've been very busy , I have n't written a diary . . . . . .
In a few days , I will have a test .
And now I want someone who can teach me English .
I know Cantonese , I can teach others speak Cantonese .
Watching the Movie `` RED ``
Today I watched the movie `` RED `` starring Bruce Willis .
I understood RED as red at first , but RED really stands for Retired Even Dangerous .
In other words , RED represents ex - CIA agents who are still dangerous .
The movie stars Bruce Willis who never disappoints me .
RED was really exciting .
When I was a teenager in highschool I liked horror movies .
As time goes by , I think my personality has changed .
I wanna tell the character a crucial thing .
There are many characters like the one above : Karaage Kun and characters for steamed meat buns , altough all of them are not aware of their critical circumstances .
I often sit in front of the computer all day long so there is a big problem for my eyes .
There is a new product , the Kindle , which will probably solve my problem .
You can hold it just like a real book , and the screen looks like the page of a book , too .
It costs over $ 200 though .
That is too expensive .
Just like normal , I spent several hours working as a receptionist , and then at midnight I looked around to see if something had gone wrong .
On the Second Floor , it suddenly got darker than before !
When I approached the operating room , I heard
scared upon hearing this and I quickly ran away from the place .
But the voice came after me as if it was telling me something important
The next day , I heard from someone that the voice was that of a deceased old lady who died from a terminal illness .
After she had an operation , she quickly died .
I should correct myself ; I probably dream every night but I only think I had a dream when I remember it .
I must say is that many times what I live in the dream is connected with my real life , with my worries .
Maybe I 'm not a person with a lot of fantasy !
I do n't believe much in the interpretation of dreams because nothing extremely strange happens . . . .
But , in the last one , I first dreamt I was inflating a bunch of balloons . . .
Then I remembered I dreamt of mice in my room .
When I woke up next day I was in a daze .
Mice ? !
In my room ? !
It was the first time I dreamt about animals .
I searched on Google and the meaning was n't so positive .
So , regardless of what your religion is , everyone is happy to say `` Merry Christmas ! ``
When you use water at a bathroom , do you use a lever from a faucet to turn it into a shower ?
In Japan we usually switch how to run water by turning a lever .
I usually use a faucet instead of a shower
to wash hands , face and so on .
Only when I am taking a shower , I use the appliance .
Because of this , I may have a terrible accident if I ever forget to & nbsp ; return the lever after using a shower .
You might suddenly take a cold shower at the nape of your neck .
It 's enough to ruin your day .
Have you ever had this sort of accident ?
Ten extra hands would have been very welcome . .
I 'm going to London in about 10 hours on a school trip , yeah !
And still , I have this eerie idea I forgot about something . . .
My friends will come along with me .
Our youth hostel is situated two hours from London , so I 'll eat a lot in my boredom .
And my best friend is quite sensitive to sugar , in the sense she gets really , really hyper and giggly .
Then she giggles about very silly things . . .
Emile Ratelband is nothing compared to her fits of laughter !
note : Emile Ratelband is a very hyper motivational trainer , who always yells ' ' Tsjaka ! ' ' .
XD I think he 'd drive me crazy if he talked to me for five minutes .
So six crazy girls polishing off a lot of sugar and chocolate is the perfect recipe to be in stitches , have a couple of girls who are fooling around and have a lot of chatter , chatter and chatter !
This means I probably wo n't get a chance to thank you all for your comments , corrections or support .
The Last Day in 2009
Today is the last day in 2009 , but I still need to take a class , while some of my friends skipped classes yesterday to go home and prepare countdown activities .
In Taiwan , before the `` countdown , `` almost every county and city will have big activities . People will gather to watch singing performances .
The most fun part of the countdown must be the firework performance .
Among all the firework performances in Taiwan , Taipei 101 is the most famous because Taipei 101 is the highest building in the world .
After the countdown , the firework performance will last 188 seconds .
When investing in the stock market , we assmue that the crowds would be attracted by the outstanding companies as time goes by .
American Idol , a TV program , is an good example .
The good news is the wisdom of crowds actually exists .
For example , when estimating the number of balls in a jar or the murder rate in New York city , the errors between the crowds always be cancelled out by each other so that the average answer is often surprisingly accurate .
On the another hand , the bad news is the wisdom of crowds is a phenomenon which is too weak to be believed .
The difference between a smart crowd and a blind crowd may be very small .
The worse thing is that the connectedness of modern life may make it more difficult to get the benifit of the wisdom of crowds , according to the new research by some Swiss scientists .
I watched high school musicla at first , it 's very interested and powerful .
Nowadays , I frequently feel sleepy in the daytime .
Today , I nearly slept in the midst of doing work .
Lack of sleep has bad effects on the body , especially on brain .
My parents have already died , so I live in my aunt 's home now .
But I 'll have to go back to my own home until I go to the USA .
There is no one here . . .
It 's only for a short time , but I may get lonely .
I have lived alone for several years .
But I feel different when I live alone in the house where I was born .
It is stylish and has a good design .
I 'm having difficulty when I use it , however I take pleasure in using it .
A successful lawsuit against nation and Pharmaceutical Company .
The plaintiff ( patients ) was success in the lawsuit against nation and phrmaceutical company .
People who work in the pharmaceutical industry , must be active in disclosing information for medical staff and patients .
My friend , whose pet name is Sunnyboy , invited me to stroll around the streets with him yesterday at 4 PM .
He wanted to send a girl who he has had a crush on a purse , which has an exquisite figure illustrated in world map .
I ordered the butter and bacon pasta , asking the waitress if the chef could omit the bacon for me for I am a vegetarian .
Finally , we went to a sports playground that has many indoor sport amenities including baseball , basketball , and soccer .
Here in Taiwan , it 's prevalent to play indoor baseball , it cost only $ 1US .
The pitching machine will pitch 30 balls in turn , whose speed can be chosen , and the players just take a bat to swing .
fm `` , but I could n't write for recent days .
One of the reason is that I do n't know if my English is correct or not .
If your diary is written in Japanese , I can check your Japanese ! !
My town has a local free magazine called `` Explorer `` .
It 's very useful because it has an event schedule for my town as well as some restaurant vouchers .
It 's published every month , and it can be found in the shopping mall , in restaurants and so on .
If your town has a free magazine , you should get it .
I 'm not sure whether I will continue working for my current company , but I am sure that I will keep working until I am 45 years old .
Ideally , I would like to move to another company which offers better conditions ; unfortunately , as a parent who is taking care of a young child , I have limited options .
The greatest difficulty is that my parents live so far away , so that they ca n't care my child for me .
Currently I 'm hiring a babysitter to take care of my child while I am at work , but sometimes I feel sorry not to care of her myself .
I ca n't pretend to her that I am happy when she cries and asks me not to go to work .
Even so , the reason I decided to continue working is to secure a better future .
I hope to have better house , earn more money , provide my child with a good education , buy what I want and go for a trip . . .
I thought I did n't want big things ; however , it was n't true .
At first , I started learning English to get a better career , but nowadays I just like talking about whatever happens around me in English because there are some people who have warm concerns and provide kind corrections .
Both in Korean and in English , I always write things in a complex way .
This week is going to be hard because I attended a relative 's wedding over the weekend so I did n't get any rest .
I really want to have a good day 's rest .
I do n't have the time . . .
I went to school and met my friends .
After school I worked part time .
Learning English from movies ?
It 's been a long time since I watched a western movie .
but are n't the characters too exaggerated when speaking ?
I mean the words , vocabulary , and way of speaking in the movies ,
Since they 're making a movie , sometimes they are more emotional when acting , including speaking .
If I learn how to speak English from movies , would it be appropriate ?
I 'm a first year student on master 's degree in SIT university .
I research in the Lab from morning to evening on weekdays .
But I have a part - time job on Saturday and Sunday .
I work as a wedding assistant .
I want to get married one day .
Today , I just spent my time resting .
I will probably go to Seoul on Saturday because it will be one of my best friends ' birthday .
It is a celebrations for my friend !
And then my schedule will be change .
I just look for a goal .
It cheers me up for my life and I believe that = )
The older we become , the shorter we feel a passing year .
I think that the length of a year is proportionate to our diminishing years .
For example , since I 'm 26 years old , a year proportionate to my age would be 1 / 26 .
On the other hand , for an elderly person who is 80 years old , a year proportionate to his age would be 1 / 80 .
I think that the elderly person would feel that a year is shorter as compared to me in the this case .
Today I was very tired because I worked a long time .
I will exercise in a near by park when I go back home .
I must do many things .
I am having a hard day .
It has been raining today .
I went to the book store to buy some books .
I am interested in power stones ^ ^
I checked my birthstone and I am going to buy my own power stone .
What are you interested in ?
I 'm more likely to have an oral ulcer , and I have two oral ulcers now .
One is on my tongue , the other is near the corner of my lower lip .
When I begin to speak or eat something , I have a terrible pain there .
But I love speaking and eating !
According to wikipedia , a picky eater , person under stress or with a food allergy is predisposed to have a oral ulcer .
I 'm not a picky eater , and many people say that it seems I hardly feel stress .
Is this cause of the oral ulcers ?
Anyway , I hope to get cured soon !
Long , long ago there was a boy who love you for so long .
But with the steps of the wind , all things have gone .
How long have I waited to see you again .
But at the end of the fairy tale , you eventually said `` bye - bye `` .
My English ability is ggetting worse and worse .
When I want to talk in English , I will think in Japanese unconsciously .
It 's so strange !
I have learned English since junior high school , but have learned Japanese for just two years .
To Chinese people , Japanese words are easier than English words .
In addition , in my college , my major is Japanese .
I use it every day , and in most classes .
Our teachers are strict .
I want to improve my English ability .
Maybe reading an English article every day ?
To be more exact , I had my father buy me a snowboard as my birthday present .
I went to Kanda , Tokyo with my father some days ago .
There was a town full of sporting goods and used books .
There were many sports company buildings and a lot of small shops .
It is November and winter will soon come !
So many shops sell snowboards and snowboarding wear .
We went in the shops and looked at the many boards .
I asked the clerk which board is good function for me and good on me .
My height is 165cm , so I should use a board about 145 - 155 cms . long .
I went back to one of the shops .
I found my favorite design .
I looked at the underside of the board .
I , of course , looked at the price tag .
At last , I found a good board .
I took it .
When I said that paperback books in the US were too expensive , my American friend said to me `` tell me about it ``
I did n't exactly know what that meant .
But it means something like , `` I agree with you `` , or `` I already know that , I think so ``
I came back to Japan yesterday and went to my parents ' house in Osaka .
I have not written any entries , in the last past few days , because I was n't able to use the internet in a hotel .
First , we went to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary .
We were able to see many famous kinds of animals in Australia such as koalas , kangaroos , wombats , and so on .
In particular , my daughter was happy to feed the kangaroos .
On the second day , we went to Moreton Island .
Morton Island is the biggest island made of sands in the world so it has many deserts .
we also enjoyed swimming in the sea , eating many kinds of dishes which were popular in Australia .
What we will never forget is that we was able to feed the wild dolphins directly .
Why do these people go crazy for CG ?
Good morning .
I plan to go shopping at Right - On today .
maximum : You need to pay maximum attention when you use gasoline .
minimum : I think his immediate action kept the damage minimum . ( just minimum seems wierd . . .
mere : I want to know the whole truth , not just a mere portion .
empty : When I visited her house , there was no one inside , and the room was empty .
vacant : I could n't find a vacant seat when I took the train . ( took a train ? )
I was planning to take an intensive class on teaching Japanese during the summer .
So , if I could take the class , I could become certified as a Japanese teacher .
When I heard about that , I was so so so so shocked !
But , there 's nothing I can do about that .
I have to wait until the next chance or just forget about it I guess .
I always think about my future but never find a good idea .
On each stall called `` Goten - Yatai `` , the girls have on colorful costumes and are playing music called `` Ohayashi `` .
They all are singing `` Kabuki - Bayashi `` same with the music which is sang in `` Kabuki `` .
Women are sitting at the behind the girls and are playing `` Shamisen `` and `` Hu - e `` flutes .
All of the people on the stalls are women and girls because `` Geisha `` were playing `` Ohayashi `` on the stall originally since ancient times .
Some of the women are real `` Geisha `` even now .
What beautiful music they play !
Why is nobody helping me to correct my compositions ? ? Maybe nobody can understand what I write ? Maybe my composition too boring ? What happened ? Who can tell me ? When the first time to write it , I 'm so excited to looking forward someone would help me .
But it 's a pity that no one corrects my compositions .
The company succeeded in making a special ink that turns clear when its temperature gets over a certain point .
So when you write with this pen , your handwriting looks as if it were written with a ball point pen . But , if you create friction , you can erase as if it were with a pencil .
You can not use it on legal documents , but for daily use it is very useful .
This pen was chosen as one of top ten new products of the year when it first appeared on the market .
I 've posted a link below .
Matel Tov !
Kasia is always smilling .
Very hot
I live in Chiba .
It 's very hot these days .
I drip sweat without doing anything .
The air conditioner is necessary .
I 'm reading an English paper about the adaptive signal now .
It 's difficult for me to read papers in English .
But , I want to study hard and expand my knowledge .
how to fall asleep quickly
Recently , it takes me a long time to fall asleep everynight .
I go to bed at 1 : 00 AM , but I 'm awake on the bed for about an hour .
So the next day I feel sleepy and tired all day .
Do you know how to go to sleep quickly ? ?
My husband 's high school friend Hori - kun , my husband , and I went to Manly Beach , which was near to Circular Quay and it took about 30 minutes by ferry .
Then I saw something blue like a thread in the water , and I thought it must be a fisherman 's fishing line .
So I was afraid that there might be a hook at the end of that thing like a fishing line , and I thought that might hurt us .
So I avoided it .
When I noted those jellyfish , an elder lylady spoke to me and she kindly told me that there was a jellyfish alert on that day .
I found I was stung by jellyfish not only once but on many parts of my body .
It 's already two weeks after the jellyfish stung me , but I still have scars on my legs .
I am still translating my father 's book into English .
Lately , a species become extinct because of activities of human beings .
The habit of animals , plants and insects especially are destroyed .
These factor hit life diversity .
My Language Exchange Partner
I met my language exchange partner today .
She is the same age as me and really good at Japanese .
It impressed and inspired me a lot .
I used to speak Japnaese well but I ca n't speak it well anymore .
I realize how easy it is to forget laguages .
Keep studying , it is hard but really essential
But my thought was changed after seeing them . This series of the movie is a story about Anakin Skywalker , who is also Darth Vader .
The person who influenced me the most is my Japanese teacher .
In addition , he recommended me to read many books , not only Japanese literature but also foreign ones .
This would broaden my outlook on life .
Now I would like to be a teacher like him and also I am taking a teaching course .
First , we have to drink at least 2000cc of water each day .
We can be full of energy if we have a good breakfast .
There 's nothing better than exercise to improve your health , and make you feel better about yourself .
The start of hard work
So I went to a cafe .
I like iced coffee .
Brondon did n't go back home this weekend , so I took 4 students .
He could n't join his group until just before dinner .
And Kome changed staff assignments .
So my schedule has changed too .
Because She 'll take George for 3 days .
First , I do n't have patience to sit still peacefully and not think about the people who have made my life difficult .
I ate a salad for lunch .
I ate cold noodles for dinner .
I could n't wait for the sun to rise .
Then by 2 am , my hands were trembling .
I could n't even draw a straight line .
I almost passed out .
I eventually got some meat to eat , and my body stopped feeling cold and stopped shaking .
Maybe I was born as a carnivore .
I ate grilled noodles for lunch .
They were very good .
But I 'm very busy with my work today .
To be honest , when I came back home from Texas in the end of May ,
my university was already in the middle of the semester , which means my school did n't let me register for classes this semester
As long as my credits for graduation have been completed , it 's okay : - ) I 've already taken classes enough to graduate , plus I 'm gon na go on to the 5th year for job hunting .
Thinking about job hunting makes me feel anxious . ) Now I 'm working for a summer internship , I 'm not sure whether I can be an intern for some company though ( Because it 's seriously competitive and the chances of me getting into a company are really low .
As for the company I applied for , ithere were over 1000 applicants while only 4 or 5 people were hired . ) Many of my friends talk reluctantly a about what 's going on with their summer internships .
I try not to have high wishes but I 'll do my best : - ) I 'm gon na take an interview with a company I really wanna work for this summer .
I heard about this web site from my co - worker today .
I 'm very excited to learn this system , and I 'm looking forward to trying it out !
just like time
Recently , there seems to be a global economic recession .
In Japan , merchandise prices have been steadily increasing while employment has been steadily decreasing
Many Japanese companies , especially exporters , have received business results starting last term that have decreased on a dramatic scale .
My company is no exception ; I fear that it may not last till the next generation . ( ? )
But they will have reached their limits by next year .
Manchester United is the biggest football club in England .
That 's my favorite team .
Since he joined Man U , he dedicated to the team .
He left the team because he conflicted with Sir Alex who was the coach of Man U .
I hope Rooney would not go the same way .
[ 2011 - 1 - 6 ] It 's a funny day - 2
On December 23 , I sent a request to study English and Japanese at ( an ) English village .
( Because of this , ) I have been studying Japanese and English , and soon I 'll have improved my language ability in English and Japanese .
keeping a diary every day is so exhausting
I want to improve my English , so I decided to write a journal every day .
But I have few topics and my english is poor , therefore it is so difficult for me to keep a diary here .
Anyway , of course I ca n't so easily give up .
I 'm always surprised by people here who keep their journals in a foreign language .
I envy them .
Yeah , I know it 's meaningless to do so .
SO I WILL KEEP A JOURNAL EVERY DAY AND I ' LL SURELY MASTER ENGLISH SOMEDAY LIKE THEM
Today , I went to an international market , the library and the supermarket .
The sunlight is getting stronger and stronger so I was wearing a hat with a wide brim .
Oh , I want to go to Hawaii again .
The wind flipped up the brim and I got a lot of sunlight . . .
I had a book I had to return so I went to the library .
The library was going to close at 6 : 00 .
I hung out with my friends yesterday .
When we met , we didnt know where the `` budaezzigae `` restaurant was .
So we walked to look for the restaurant for an hour .
We found the restaurant in the end .
But I made my friends suffer by walking for an hour .
It 'll help us save time .
I love to meet and make many foreign friends .
I hope to communicate with them and have a good time with them !
My dream is to live in Australia sometime in the future .
It 's my dream .
On a couch
I 'm listening to my favorite music now .
In titled `` Come back home : by Two door cinema club `` .
Time for relaxation . . . . .
What do you usually do to relax ?
I am usually reading a fashion magazine while listening to music .
That 's my favorite time .
Tomorrow will be Friday !
I wanted to goto the sea , to relaxor ( get rid of hardworking )
I had been seeing it in front of my eyes all day . . .
It was my son 's school festival yesterday .
My wife took part in a mini - car racing game .
While she was doing that , the other member of my family had lunch .
My American friend started a music blog !
Actually he is a Japanese learner , and we have been doing a language exchange every day for a year and a half over Skype .
I really think that keeping a blog in the language we are learning is a great idea because we can use the language daily .
In my case , I love receiving comments from people because it always encourages me and motivates me to continue keeping blogs in English .
So , to announce his blog , I have linked his music blog to two of my blogs today .
I also introduced his blog to some Japanese social networking sites that I have been using like Mixi .
I posted his blog 's URL in my Japanese blog and on my Facebook wall .
I hope his blog will become world famous , and he will be able to get many international followers .
After we graduated we had a long break , but finally got back in touch last year .
I think she almost changed my life because I do n't think I would have been the same me without being friends with her during that period .
She was living at her boyfriend 's mom 's house with him and his parents .
In my opinion , her boyfriend seems like a person who discourages her by ignoring her .
I am pretty sure having that kind of boyfriend for over seven years has affected her personality little by little .
I do n't know when my dream will come true .
I caught a cold
3 days ago I had a sore throat . . .
Today I have a runny nose , headache , and a bad cough .
Those are symptoms of a cold .
I caught a cold today : (
When we see an object , we do it by ( capturing / receiving ) light reflected from the object .
Since light propagates at a finite speed , there must be a delay in this process .
The CMB is not only a messenger who stores an enormous amount of information about the early universe , but also important clues to answer essential questions since the beginning of human history , like `` what is the shape of the universe ? `` , `` what is the future of the universe ? ``
My research is aimed at giving a more accurate analysis of the CMB , by examining the interaction between plasma in clusters of galaxies and the CMB .
I believe that exploring the universe we live in is one of the most important vocations one can experience
Nobody can . foretell .
For this reason , we should make an effort to fulfill our dreams or wishes .
What do you see yourself doing in five years time ?
I 'd like to study overseas to master English again and I need to learn some methods to make my lessons more attractive and enjoyable .
In addition , I need to know a lot about the cultural differences between Japan and other countries because I believe that I should not only teach English but also help my students understand cultural differences in English class .
As my daughter is now eight years old , she will graduate from elementary school and will be going to junior high school five years from now .
I hope to maintain a good relationship with her .
Yesterday night , I began planning to go to a live concert of one of the most well - known bands in Japan .
The band 's name is Mr .
I do n't know why they have this name ( and I 'm sure they are not real children , as they are all over thirty years old .
Actually , I have never been to a decent concert .
Some of my friends have been to concerts and they all say they enjoyed them soooooooo much , and whenever I hearthem say anything like that , I envy them so much .
Thus , I decided that this year I would like to , or I must attend a live concert !
At the same time , if it is bothersome , I decided to go to the most popular one !
However , there are things I had to do , first .
First , getting tickets is so difficult , because so many people intend to go .
They are very popular in Japan .
And another problem is my partner 's exam might be on the same day as the concert , but we are not sure yet .
There are some situations wherein we should not use mobile phones .
For example when we are in class or in a meeting at work .
This is issue arises debate right now .
This does not just concern adults .
Everyone needs to know whether is appropriate to use mobile phones in certain situations .
So even if bringing cellphones is banned at school ,
It is not a good basis to judge them .
Children should learn good manners while they are young .
I realized that Ive worked for 27 days without holiday !
I 'll go to Turkey for 9 days starting tomorrow .
It 'll be great if somebody has anything info about Turkey for me !
As you know , JFA named Alberto Zaccheroni as the new coach of the Japanese national football team , however , he could n't be at this game because he did not get his visa .
This was the first time in 10 years I saw the national team 's match live .
About 66000 people were gathered at the stadium , which is the maximum capacity of the stadium .
What is good news for me is that 7 of the starting players plays overseas .
Kagawa who plays for Borussia Dortmund in Germany got the goal .
It was beautiful goal .
native speakers :
The consective holidays , an event which lasted for about 10 days , was over .
During that period we spent lots of money frivolously , which we had not
planned .
Consequently , we now have a hard time living economically
.
I click on another tab on my browser and glance at lang - 8 .
Correcting or commenting to someone 's diary makes me awake .
Lang - 8 is kind of restorative for me : )
I 'm a junior high school student .

Thank u for your polite and warm messages and corrections ! ! !
I wanted to reply to all of them .
So I will write messages this week .
Ginza is Japan 's most expensive real estate .
Recently , the world 's brand shops , especially reasonable brands , have opened in Ginza . Like H & M , Abercrombie & Fitch , Uniqro , Gap , Forever 21 and so on . So Ginza became easy to approach for ordinary citizens .
Yesterday , I went to see my dad in Kobe .
It is near Osaka station .
I did n't have enough time to take pics , but I found some through the internet .
Haha , I 've no idea , but I can guess the owner of that building wo n't sell his real estate , and the road constructors had no way out .
On Saturday , I attended a lecture about preventive medicine .
So people now have more interest in what they eat in the USA .
The government imposed a tax on carbonated drinks ( like Coke ) , and every food has a label indicating nutrition , especially trans - fat .
Trans - fat is very harmful to your health , but many kinds of junk food , like hamburgers , fried potatoes , and pizza contain trans - fat .
Since Japanese food , like sushi and sashimi , contains less trans - fat , it has recently become very popular in the USA .
Is this true ?
I 've never heard of a tax imposed on Coke .
Singapore life
Tomorrow I 'd like to try to get a drink at the bar alone , and communicate with clerks and other customers in there .

So please help me `` use the language `` .
Is Octopus Paul the dominator behind the World Cup results ?
My 3 years of high school passed so quickly .
so I am satisfied with my high school days .
every student had to give a speech in each classroom .
