So I went to a ce ll p h on e sh op and I question ed why it re st ar ted by it s el f every time .
The as s is t ant said without feel ing that he did n ' t know the reason and it need ed to be re p a ir ed at the head office .
A l s o he me n tion ed that it might have co st a charge .
Then , I to t ally get ma d and said , `` H u h !
What do you mean you did n ' t know at all ? ?
You mean al th ough I bu y b ro k en thing , I have to sp en d money for this ?
I c a n ' t understand . I do n ' t understand .
F or g e t it ! F or g e t about it !
You good for nothing ! ``
In the end , this pro ble m has n ' t been f i x ed yet . . .
and I need to be a lady .
I have found a good English S t ud y ing we b sit e .
because they co st too much money .
I have read some ar t ic le s saying that some English class es do n ' t tea ch good e ng l ish , or that some students do n ' t make any sen se of it , or that it does n ' t f it their e ng l ish le ve l .
I might be a l u c k y girl because I can understand English even though I do n ' t take any less on s .
But my English le ve l is in ter m ed i ate .
My e ng l ish is good enough to con ver se with n at ive speak er s .
I am glad I speak English and can con ver se with n at ive people .
I ' m not great at speak ing English but I can get along with n at ive people .
I am ha p p y that I can make friend s with n at ive people
If you come to J a p an and speak a little J a p an e se , you will be prais ed for speak ing J a p an e se , even if the sen t ence you speak is very short .
That ' s because J a p an e se people think the J a p an e se language is one of the most difficult language s in the world .
They have p ri d e in their own language .
However , in my opinion , J a p an e se is n ' t the most difficult language comp ar ed to other language s .
There are two reason s why .
J a p an e se has f e w er v ow el s and con s on ant s than English .
He want ed to say he was in the middle of the c amp a i g n and said loud ly , `` I have an e re ction now ! ``
The hard est one s to dis ting u ish are `` hu r t `` from `` heart `` and `` f a st `` from `` first `` .
It sound s a b s o l ut e ly the same to J a p an e se .
J a p an e se pro n un c i ation is e as i er than other As i an language s as well .
It has a much more comp le x sound than J a p an e se .
It does n ' t have ma le or f e m al e ver b s like F re n ch , S p an ish and Russian do .
There are no s ing ul ar for m s and p l ur al for m s .
No ar t ic le s are need ed .
There are f e w er p at ter n s of con j u g ation .
The se are the two reason s why I believe J a p an e se is not difficult .
I believe the most difficult thing in le ar n ing J a p an e se is writing it because most people are n ' t us ed to it s letter s .
But you should n ' t he s it ate to start le ar n ing J a p an e se .
I brought my do g to get tri m m ed yesterday .
The first p h ot o is before , other s are after .
I think every body has similar mind s and similar p ot ent i al .
He re is my question :
M a y b e there is some re se ar ch on why people f a il when they try to le ar n language ?
Yes ter day , my school had a ha t day .
If we want ed to we ar our ha t s , we had to pay $ 2 .
The money is then con t ri b ut ed .
But I did n ' t we ar my ha t because I for g ot on the day ^ ^
L is ten ing to English pro g r a m s , study ing English ma g a z in es , e t c .
We have to study English now , or we w o n ' t pass an im p or t ant t est in three year s .
There is going to be a J a p an e se school visit ing our school .
And I going to receiv e one of the students .
We will have e i g h t J a p an e se students in each class .
We will have a less on with them .
And we will tea ch T a i w an e se history about J a p an e se a g g re s s ion against T a i w an .
We all laugh ed when our history teacher told us that .
M a y b e we will say something about their con t ri b u tion after the J a p an e se were a g g re s s ive to w ar d s us .
We will do a l ot of act i v it ies when the J a p an e se students come .
I went to O k in a w a the so u ther n part of J a p an as a school even t this week .
We were there for four days . The first three days were ra in y and c l o ud y , so I did n ' t feel I was in so u ther n is l and .
A l s o , the hotel we stay ed the last day was in the c ent er of N a ha C ity , the c a p it al c ity of O k in a w a , so it made me feel like I was in Tokyo .
But it was the last big even t in my high - school life , so I enjoy ed sp en d ing time with my friend s there and visit ing many place s .
We enjoy ed water act i v it ies in the beautiful o ce an and visit ed an a qu ar e um , a m us e um and other things .
E ver y th ing went well without any trouble and the tri p made me re al i z e an im p or t ant thing . So I think it was n ic e to ex pe ri ence it .
I have been quite bu s y the last co up le of days because of my ex a m s at the un ive r s ity .
I ' m a st ud ent at the S il es i an U n ive r s ity of T e ch no l o g y in the E n v ir on ment al E ng in e er ing de p ar t ment .
I enjoy my class es a l ot and I know I will mi s s them when I gradua te .
I have one ex a m left and when I pass it , I ' m going to have some time off .
My da d and I are going to F r ance to go s k i ing .
I c a n ' t wait ! : ) When we come back I will have to start work ing on my the s is , which is about v ent il ation and he at ing in pass ive house s .
My ma in ta s k is to make a pro j e c t of it and to make a co st - effect ive ness an a ly s is .
I re m e m b er the day ( when ) I first watch ed T er m in at or 2 .
It was a re ally ex c it ing f il m with two c y b or g guy s called ter m in at or s cha s ing and fight ing each other .
But it made me wonder how soon we would see a so c i e ty where such c y b or g s or hu man o id ro b ot s are living with us .
A l th ough it will take time before we can act u ally c re ate such so p h is t ic at ed c y b or g s , we may soon be able to have a simple r hu man o id ro b ot which can help us in our da i ly live s .
So if you want one of the ro b ot s to mo ve it s right ar m , for ex amp le , all you need to do is just think about it in your head .
That is a w es ome .
I ' m a little conc er n ed that this kind of te ch no l o g y will be us ed for mi l it ar y purpose s ( as you can see in the mo v i e ) .
I know , for better or w or se , te ch no l o g ical de ve l op ment s always go hand in hand with mi l it ar y act i v it ies .
B y the way , I think the mo v i e has a se qu el .
A fter I came back home , I put on the same - co l or up p er to ma t ch with it and I was sat is f i ed with how it looked .
I los t my ha t last sat ur day .
I got an e - ma il saying that it was found .
It ' s re ally co o l to me e t a l ot of for e i g n friend s here .
M an y l o ve ly people are g i v ing me co ur age and c or re ction s . Even though my E ng .
Even though my English is a big dis aster , you guy s * still c or re c t my mistake p at i ent ly .
I have had it ch y eyes all day .
My friend s said that you should n ' t s c r at ch your eyes .
That would make it w or se .
I thought about what could have cause d this .
I re g is ter ed on this sit e to day .
That mean s the week en d is just around the corner .
This week en d , my family will be hold ing a part y to ce le b r ate my da d ' s b ir th day . y
I am not de c id ed yet but must at least p l an for it this after no on .
I am think ing about sp or t s we ar to bu y for him to en c o ur age him to work out .
She will stay for 4 days .
I c a n ' t wait for her to come / get here .
A n y way , I have a p l an to go to K y ot o or N ar a .
What do you think ?
W i ll she like it ?
I do n ' t know what kind of f o o d she like s .
You can p ar k your c ar be s id e the hotel .
You can not p ar k your c ar in front because it ' s a no p ar k ing z on e .
As soon as I started writing , I receiv ed some commen t s .
So I ' d like to con t in u e my di ar y .
My do g `` F al `` , who is It al i an gra y h ound , does n ' t like
to stay at home alone .
A fter only a f e w hour s , he mi s se s me .
But a do g s life is n ' t so long , so I ' m going to stay with him
as long as I po s s i b ly can .
This is my first time to write a di ar y in an English ,
so some of my English gra m m ar s are n ' t po l ish ed yet .
I ho pe you can c or re c t some of it s er r or s .
To day is my b ir th day . : )
I had my ha ir c ut and my black ha ir was d y ed dark b r ow n .
It was a great b ir th day !
But when I left my home , I knew I would be l ate .
The bu s that I want ed to get on was was l ate too .
As a re s ul t I was able to get on the bu s , and I was just in time for the job .
A bout K it ten s .
I ' m stay ing at my friend s house now .
I think being c ut e is strong er than anything now .
If now was the an c i ent age , they would be k il led or eat en im m ed i ate ly by a s n a ke or something , but now is the mo d er n er a .
The s n a ke is p ic k ed out from it s position by much a strong er an im al , the hu man being .
So , k it ten s got much more p ow er with their c ut e ness .
The k it ten s ' per f e c t c ut e ness is much more p ow er ful than the in c o m p le te p ow er of s n a ke s now .
M an y people ga ther ed there to p r a c t is e their ten n is .
A fter p r a c t ic ing , me and ( my friend ? ) As an o were ma t ch ed against a strong pai r .
To tell the tru th , they were n ' t that strong , but we los t any way .
As an o was in bad condition to day .
I re al i z ed when my part n er was in bad condition that all you need is tea m w or k .
I think many people have new year ' s go al s . So do I .
My new year ' s go al is to pass J a p an e se 2 le ve l and im p ro ve my e ng l ish .
S in ce I ' ve started work ing , my interest in study ing is less than before , when I was in co ll e g e .
But I found if you do not study , your bra in may become more and more un in te ll i g ent .
So I suppose that we must study only if we have time .
I think people should n ' t be able to ch o o se when they want to di e ,
since it is also m ur d er .
Some people say it not only help s to end their pai n but also it help s to so l ve their family ' s e c on o m ic pro ble m s .
They have a right which is to live a quiet life for the re st of their days .
This is a b less ing .
If they had co m m it ted a c ri m e , they could at on e .
I have n ' t been much of a history bu f f myself ,
there f or e I do n ' t know the de ta il s of an c i ent c i v il i z ation s .
I think they are still re le v ant to day because history has a way of re pe at ing it s el f .
That way , they can feel f a m il i ar with an c i ent history .
I think that when you study history , it ' s good idea to try to see k what history has in co m m on with our so c i e ty now .
G o o d - by e , 2 0 0 9 !
I have live d in N Y since S ept e m b er , coming from J a p an . And I am now dis c o ver ing and wonder ing at new things I le ar n about the U S , and writing about my question s or commen t s .
the other day I was sh ock ed with the dis p ut e on a T V show .
she re p or ted that her kid see m ing ly be ha v ed strange ly . So when she asked what was wrong with her , she con f es s ed their father , I mean her hu s b and a b us ed the d aught er .
the conc l us ion was , that she lie d because she want ed to get back c ust o d y of her first d aught er who now live s with her ex hu s b and .
the reason that she was de p ri v ed of her c ust o d y of their first ch il d , was she over d o s ed on co c a in e ( I for g ot why she had it at the time )
I thought C o ur t T V show s de al t with easy case s , but I do n ' t know what is easy and what is serious in the U S .
about the re st of my U K life
To day is the second day of M a y .
F o ur month s have pass ed since new year s day and this mean s that my v is a ex p ir es with in ten month es .
R e c ent ly , I have been think ing how to sp en d the re st of my time in this country .
I left L on d on at the be g g in ing of M ar ch and I ' ve been work ing on the far m for two month s .
I can say that my life on the far m has been better than what I im a g in ed before I started it . [ more natural ]
But , honest ly , I am feel ing a little b it tired because of having done physical works for two month s .
F or t un ate ly , I have some things to do in L on d on at the end of this month .
So it must be a good ch ance for me to take a re st and de c id e what to do after that .
I have n ' t de c id ed yet , but , after tak ing a re st , I would like to start work ing on the far m again and keep do ing it as long as possible .
This morning while I was sleep ing some on e sen t a me s s age to me and said `` W a ke up , w a ke up No y `` or something like that . She is my s is ter who live s so far from me , but we are close in our heart s .
A bout 5 second s la ter she called me again to say good morning . I did not answer because we know if she call s me it mean s she would like to say good morning or good night .
She got dis c on ne c ted from S k y pe yesterday while me and T y l er were talk ing because it is a bad con ne ction from her country .
B e f or e she left she did not say something to me as she usual ly does because she was s ud d en ly go ne .
I will as k her for a hu g another day when I see her again .
And I want to say something to her . I am sorry I have no money to sen d her back a me s s age . P o or No y .
I also listen ed to a very good so ng from T y l er yesterday .
He c a n ' t s ing but he can hu m and dance and and play the g u it ar .
F ro m to day , I will try to write a di ar y in English .
This n ic k n ame come s from G H I B L I ' s character .
I like this G H I B L I ' s mo v ies , like `` To n ar in o to t or o `` and `` M a z y on o T a k k y u b in `` .
N e x t , I live in Ka n a g a w a , J a p an .
But , I live d in F u ku o k a unti l this M ar ch .
So now , I sea r ch good place s like c a f e , p ar k , re st a ur ant and so on .
R e c ent ly , I found a good c a f e ! !
My re c o m m en d ed mo v i e ( or I re c o m m en d the mo v i e ) is `` The T i g er and The S n ow `` .
I will !
If I ' m a P it ch er . . .
F or a long time , I went to So ng ga ng D on g f i el d in or d er to play a b a se b a ll game in e ar ly morning .
Then , I tri ed to go there , and also It was difficult to dr ive my c ar because I me t a friend who live s in S e o ul yesterday .
To day was a very hot day .
We play ed The In st it ut e of N ation al S e c ur ity S c i ence at 1 1 p m .
I ' m a p it ch er and the 5 th hi t ter .
I ' m a bad b a se b a ll play er but I ex er c is e hard d ur ing the la ter w in ter .
O ur game started at 1 2 : 0 0 and I was so n er v ous .
My be se b a ll care er is short er than every on e ' s but I have good physical a b il it ies like f a st feet , strong should er s , and end ur ance for any pai n .
I also ent h us i a st ic ally do everything not to los e . .
C h in e se C a ll i g r a p h y and T r ad i tion al C h in e se P a in ting !
H i , ( my ) for e i g n friend s , es pe c i ally those of you who are interest ed in C h in e se c ul ture . I want to tell you about two im p or t ant part s of C h in e se c ul ture to day !
C h in e se call i g r a p h y , which is has been p r a c t ic ed for at least 3 0 0 0 year s , is a b ri ll i ant tra d i tion al ar t .
I have t aught myself how to write call i g r a p h y and w ro te the ex amp le in my al b um ( * _ * ) .
C h in e se pai n ting , the tra d i tion al ar t , is pai n ted by writing b r us he s that are also us ed in call i g r a p h y !
I also dr e w the picture in my al b um myself
C h in e se call i g r a p h y and tra d i tion al C h in e se pai n ting both
So this ar t ic le must be wrong in many place s , than k s for your c or re ction s and a d v ic e ! )
I went back home ! !
I took a M on or a il .
My house is con ve n i ent .
B e c a us e it is near the st ation .
I have no re l i g ion , but the class is he l d for any on e who is interest ed in it .
A l th ough I ' m not that school st ud ent , they we l c ome me , so this is re ally good op p or t un ity to le ar n English and the B i ble .
S in ce our re g ul ar teacher has to work another te m p or ar y job for 6 week s , my A m er ic an friend who us ed to a st ud ent of the class sub st it ut es for our teacher for the time being .
I have come to feel close r to her than before .
This year I ' ve started to study b al le t . It ' s know n that you only can le ar n to dance b al le t when you are a ch il d , or at least that was I always thought , but I was l u c k y to have the ch ance .
It was e m b ar r as s ing at first because I was the old est girl there , but with time I ' ve le ar n ed to enjoy it ^ ^
O ur teacher always say s `` I will never all ow my students to be less than me . You have to become at least as good as me . ``
This month he want s our us to de b ut as a b al le t comp an y , not only as a a c ad e m y , so we are do ing to do a show with other a c ad e m ies from P er u , C h i le and A r g ent in a .
We are do ing `` C op pe l i a `` , even though we are not pro f es s ion al dance r s . We are a d d ing a little b it of f un to the original play and it is going it great .
I s It G o o d to be P er s u as ive ?
In my c ul ture , people are not always a g g re s s ive and we are always think ing about other s , as much as , or indeed more than our s el ve s . [ 1 ]
S in ce I am not from the States , I am not sure about the c ul ture here .
As far as I have heard and ex pe ri ence d , the c ul ture here is that people care about themselves more than other s . They are more s el f - c ent er ed , which I do n ' t mean in a good no r bad way .
S in ce c ul ture is very im p or t ant in every day life ,
how we should act depend s on the c ul ture or no r m in the place we live .
F or ex amp le , in my country , the dis t ance between people is less , so everything can be f le x i ble and it depend s on the re l ation s h i p between the people in v o l v ed .
However , in the United States , re g ul ation s and law s come first .
There f or e , I always think before I act because I am not sure what the c or re c t way to act is .
F or ex amp le , I have a question : if some on e re f us es your propos al , is it o k to be per s u as ive and as k the person again ?
To day , I went to watch a mo v i e .
The ti t le is `` E at P la y L o ve `` . J ul i a R o b er t s is act ing in this f il m .
My friend said this mo v i e is not so good j ud g ing by a we b s ite s ur ve y , but I do n ' t agree .
It was a good mo v i e .
The ma in character tra ve led to I ta ly , In d i a and B al i .
She me t many people and found her s el f .
She perform ed me d it ation in In d i a .
It see m s hard but I think it ' s a good way to see myself de e p ly .
If I have a pro ble m , I want to try me d it at ing .
M or e o ver , when I saw the scene in I ta ly , it made me want to go to I ta ly .
A c t u ally , I have been there . I at e past a and p i z z a .
The p i z z a I at e in I ta ly was the be st I have ever had .
I want to eat it again .
It has been 3 month s since I came here .
I was suppose d to give le c ture s right after mo v ing to this c ity , but for t un ate ly at that time it was a va c ation .
A t first , I enjoy ed my free time .
I re al i z ed that do ing nothing make s my body and so ul tired
The most difficult thing in some on e ' s life might be to find c l o th es that f it per f e c t ly , I think .
Where are my c l o th es is wait ing for me ?
A re there any c l o th es that f it me . . ?
( But . . .
A c t u ally I b ough t 3 shirt s and 1 pai r of p ant s .
That ' s it . )
If I find something that look s good on me , I should put it down first .
D o I re ally want this ?
N e x t , If the c l o th es are re ally good on me , I should think again . I s this re ally ne ce s s ar y ? ?
I b ough t one pai r of p ant s a f e w month s a g o .
The p ant s are in hi p - ho p style .
It does n ' t f it my body . It make s me look like a d w ar f .
It was an im p ul se bu y .
So , I de c id ed , when I bu y any c l o th es , I ' ll follow that s te p ! !
If your friend tell s you to bu y something , Say `` Let me sleep on it `` .
S t ud i o G h i b l i was est a b l ish ed by M i y a z a k i in 1 9 8 5 .
S t ud i o G h i b l i has to con t in u e living as a comp an y , so , it has to c ul t i v ate new t al ent in an im ation f il m s .

I like to live here but a it ' s little in c on ve n i ent .
B e c a us e I have to go to S e o ul every day . It ' s too far from I l s an .
It ' s a very bu s y life .
I mi s s my old house a little .
H i guy s , it ' s a been long time since I w ro te a di ar y last time .
I like d to draw picture s when I was an e le ment ar y school er , and now , I like us ing P h ot o s h op .
It took 3 0 mi n from my f l at by b i ke , so I did n ' t go there after a while . .
H a ha , now I ' m bra g g ing about it .
But still I c a n ' t draw a p ic us ing P h ot o s h op and I still do n ' t have any con f id ence about it .
A c t u ally , I us ed so f t w ar e on the we b to pro ce s s the picture .
The big bo y ( ? ) on this p ic is the original picture .
This is so r t of a f est i v al po s ter .
One of my friend s man age d this f est i v al through his c l u b .
He dr a g g ed in va ri ous kind s of people .
In addition , he asked a comp an y to be a sp on s or , and got some money .
My go al is to make good po s ter s and works without some so f t w ar e ( ex c ept , be s id es ) P h ot o s h op .
What ' s your ho b b y ?
S or ry I did n ' t us e a di ction ar y a l ot this time , so there is probab ly a l ot of mistake s . . . > <
To day was a la z y day . . .
I have n ' t been to the s w im m ing po o l ( l ate ly ) , and my s w im m ing s k i ll s are in a poor condition . I must do something about it .
To day is a very w ar m and fine day .
But the se fine days w o n ' t last much long er .
I ' m watch ing a T V pro g r a m called `` P U - S S U M A `` now . It ' s a very p op ul ar pro g r a m .
In J A P A N , we have many c as u al ( family ) re st a ur ant s of va ri ous co un t ri es ' f o o d .
It ' s a very funny pro j e c t .
L a st S un day , I b ough t a co f f e e make r at Y O D O B A S H I came r a in A k i b a .
I ' m from V i e t n a m and I want to le ar n K or e an and English with you guy s !
No t eat ing good f o o d made me feel bad while I was work ing .
I re ally re al i z ed that a proper me al was im p or t ant for my he al th .
I watch ed H ar ry P ot ter and the H al f B l o o d P r in ce . [ ti t le s are c a p it al i z ed ]
D is a p po in ted !
I come to this sit e every day to find if any on e has looked at my j o ur n al and sen t me me s s age s .
I said to myself if you do n ' t write no body will come your p age to help you c or re c t your mistake s .
F ri en d s , no matter what co un t ri es you come from and what language s you want to le ar n , I think we can become friend s , not only for the reason of `` le ar n ing language s `` .
D o es it mean litera l ly `` go out of the ho s p it al `` ?
O r does it mean `` go out with their bo y f ri en d s or girl f ri en d s `` ?
D o the se two sen t ence s mean ex a c t ly the same thing ? [ Yes . ]
The R a p p er Well - know n B y The J a p an e se
M a y b e it is only the you ng people know about E m in e m .
The other ar t is t s are probab ly not know n by J a p an e se people .
M a y b e the J a p an e se people like ra p or R & B would know the other ra p p er s .
Why E m in e m is know n by the J a p an es people is because he was act ing the mo v i e , 8 mi le s .
F ro m then I have like d him .
B e f or e he act ed in the mo v i e I like d his so ng s .
He had so l d f un ra p m us ic in those days .
There was a l ot of ra p m us ic but there was n ' t one such as E m in e m .
S in ce I started work ing at the U n ive r s ity , I of ten re m e m b er my high school days .
I had some good friend s and we laugh ed a l ot every day .
We talk ed about people we were interest ed in , teachers , b a se b a ll game s , m us ic , mo t or c y c le s , our part - time job s and our dr e a m s . . !
T h o se were pretty good days for us .
But we probab ly should have st ud i ed more . .
When we gradua ted from ( our ) high school , my friend s ga ve me a great p ri z e .
That was `` the f un n ies t of the class `` p ri z e !
But my friend got the p re t t ies t girl p ri z e , another friend got the s m ar t est p ri z e . . . .
it ' s o k a y .
A n y way , I was of the to p students in my class . . . !
A c t u ally , I still like ma k ing people laugh .
One of my friend s is a p h y s ic i an , one live s in F r ance , and another is a stay - at - home mother right now .
We have n ' t see n each other for a long time , so I ' d like to me e t them some day .
To day I have only Russian and L at in language s at the un ive r s ity .
To m or r ow we ' ll have a t est in our English less on .
A l s o , we need to make a pro j e c t about f a m ous people or the f a m ous law y er s of our c ity .
I do n ' t even know what to write !
A l s o we have to about 2 0 0 new English w or d s by heart .
M or e o ver , our l i b r ar y does n ' t want to give us our b ook s .
But I ho pe it will get w ar m er .
I like r ock m us ic but I some time s listen to j a z z , electronic and p op ( ? ) m us ic .
I want to listen to English so ng s to p r a c t ic e my English .
No w all students in R us s i a ( or are having ) ex a m s .
It ' s a hard time . . .
No w I write ( or am writing ) a course about fashion of the 7 0 ' s .
I like 7 0 ' s hi p p i e ( fashion s ) , p un k & dis c o ( m us ic ) , and the st ud i o 5 4 ( night c l u b ) .
I saw the f il m `` st ud i o 5 4 `` , it was a c r a z y c l u b .
There is a c l u b called `` st ud i o 74 `` in the c ity where I live , but it is n ' t like the one in N e w Y or k ha ha
I do n ' t know what to write , I think my letter ( or is becom ing ) b or ing
It ' s been a big pro ble m for me for a long time .
To day when I was study ing English , I re al i z ed that I was n ' t el i g i ble to become a teacher because I am not good at con ver s ation .
I think I ' m not qu al if i ed to become a teacher unless I enjoy con ver s ation .
If you do n ' t have co m m un ic ation s k i ll , you should n ' t be teaching .
As I came to the a b o ve conc l us ion this after no on , I went to a ch ur ch where I ha ng out a l ot .
There I de c id ed to talk about what I have in mind more po s it ive ly .
N e x t time , I ' m going to talk to a person who I am at t r a c ted to .
In t ro d u ce myself
He ll o ! !
I re c ent ly gradua ted from co ll e g e and I started to work for a comp an y this sp r ing .
I dr e a m of study ing a b ro ad but I have poor English s k i ll s !
But now , I study e c on o m ic s more , since my job is de e p ly re la ted with e c on o m ic s .
My favor ite f o ot b a ll tea m
I had done some writing on my b l o g for 9 days in a r ow .
I ' ll start ma k ing a new re c or d from to day on w ar d ! !
They are a J a p an e se pro f es s ion al f o ot b a ll tea m .
I ' m an a v id f an of them .
That make s me de light ed , tru ly .
In fact , J e f is not a strong tea m , they are in second di v is ion of J a p an e se f o ot b a ll le a gue .
O ri g in ally , They were in the first di v is ion .
L a st year , they were n ' t pro m ot ed to first di v is ion .
This year , the le a gue has just started .
A c t u ally the ma t ch w o n ' t be a ir ed on T V .
so A ll I can do is to c he c k the pro g re s s on the in ter ne t .
To day , I was sleep y in all my class es .
I was re ally ex cited yesterday , it must have made me tired .
B e ing in good condition is very im p or t ant when tak ing a t est .
The co un t ri es that I want to visit are T ha il and , U .
That is too many co un t ri es but , I ' d like to visit those co un t ri es T .
I want to ex pe ri ence the c ul ture or f est i v al s of other co un t ri es ( H a ll ow e en , S a m b a , O p er a , e t c . . . )
But , There are K or e an f est i v al that I have n ' t ex pe ri ence d .
There f or e , I want to ex pe ri ence K or e a ' s c ul ture first .
I ' d like to ex pe ri ence the M ud F est i v al .
The M ud F est i v al is f un f est i v al , where you a p p ly m ud all over your body
I ' m d y ing to go there .
To day , I ' m writing in my di ar y in my free time .
I am watch ing an English mo v i e .
I want to get us ed to n at ive speak er s .
I am f a c k ed ( ? ? ? ) with a many difficult pro ble m s .
I ' ll c ar ry on study ing and with my life s ty le .
I know that many people think that in S i b er i a it is w in ter all year round .
But S i b er i a is very , very big .
In most are as , s um m er o c c ur s every year .
I once heard that in S i b er i a , be ar s walk on the town s ' street s .
And on N e w Y e ar s people catch all the be ar s in their town , ha r ness them and ri d e on s led g es all night .
There are be ar s of course .
They live de e p in the for est s and not in the c it ies .
I have live d in S i b er i a all my life and I have me t be ar s only in the z o o .
To day , the morning was co o l and the after no on was w ar m .
F or this reason , we have to be care ful not to catch a co l d .
I had some free time to day since there were not many other people around .
I have st ud i ed di c t ation as well as read ing in English .
N e x t week I will go to a language school to im p ro ve my speak ing a b il it ies .
This co m m er c i al was about the di g it al i z ation of T V .
This co m m er c i al said that just two month s are left unti l the start of the di g it al i z ation .
I feel that it ' s just around the corner .
A n y way , _ how about your country ?
I s T V di g it al i z ation co m m on ?
English speak er s us e high f re qu en c y .
When English speak er s speak English , they us e very high to ne s comp ar ed to J a p an e se people .
Some time s I am watch ing and listen ing to English ar t is t s ' m us ic v id e o s on You T u b e , but even ma le ar t is t s ' to ne s are very high .
Some f e m al e English speak er s es pe c i ally are speak ing English with very high to ne s .
It sound s very pretty to J a p an e se me n .
It ' s as if their voice s are J a p an e se voice act or s who are act ing like a ch il d .
I like L in k in P ar k .
I want to speak English as f l u ent ly as my mother to n gue . . .
I ` m a 2 0 year old J a p an e se me d ical st ud ent
my ho b b y is J a p an e se mar t i al ar t s .
So I want to have a s k y pe friend s who se mother to n gue is English , and to make many friend s who are over se as .
P le a se do n ' t he s it ate to speak to me .
In the future , I will have to speak English f l u ent ly for my o c c up ation .
I do n ' t have much time
I know that it ' s time to study hard .
I ho pe time will go f aster than now
I could s w im 5 0 0 me t re s .
I was like a fish when I s w a m ! !
I have a long M a y week en d and I am try ing to raise my English le ve l .
I watch ed a B B S show ( of course in e ng l ish ) and I listen ed to more P o d c a st s .
I still sea r ch for the be st me th o d of le ar n ing .
In the future I w o n ' t be able to get out of my country . . .
My friend let me b or r ow a very interest ing English b ook .
It is about the U .
; ) I think that I have to sea r ch for a friend to con ver se with on s k y pe or to help me with writing letter s . I s any on e will ing ? ( 9 .
T h re e days a g o , my un ive r s ity friend s and I at e k im u ch i p an .
We put in va ri ous kind s of f o o d .
F or ex amp le , C h in e se c a b b age s , ha c k b er ry s , to f u , J a p an e se n i k ud an g o s , g y o u z as and so on .
We put c he e se on to p .
It was more de l ic i ous .
I had never eat en it .
It was very very good !
K y ot o is a tra d i tion al J a p an e se c ity .
In J a p an , it is a ut um n .
So the leave s have turn ed re d .
We walk ed while look ing at the co l or ed leave s .
I could n ' t see k i y o m i z ud er a at night because we did n ' t have time .
If you have a ch ance to go to K y o ut o , I re c o m m en d you go to `` k i y o m i z ud er a `` .
I was ha p p y to have live d a full life in this week .
Yes ter day , I was play ing with my friend s .
While eat ing de s s er t , we p on d er ed what we should do after w ar d s .
The f il m ' s ti t le is ' R o b in H o o d ' .
The mo v i e was very ex c it ing and good .
We pro m is ed to me e t after f in al ex a m s .
What an interest ing b ook ! !
The se days I am read ing the no ve l `` M aster of the game `` written by S id ne y She l d on .
My friend re c o m m en d ed me that b ook and it ' s so interest ing that I c a n ' t stop read ing it .
A c t u ally , once I started to read , I could n ' t stop even if it was l ate in the even ing !
So , I never start read ing this b ook at night .
I am read ing it in J a p an e se now , but after I finish read ing , I would like to try
to read it in English .
In the no ve l , `` The so n of Ka te ( who is one of the ma in character s of the b ook ) , To n n y `` was
ho s p it al i z ed for p s y ch i at ri c reason s after his w if e ' s de a th .
B e c a us e his w if e M ar i an ne was de ad .
It ' s a tra g ed y .
I ' m wonder ing what will be in the end , and I ' m look ing for w ar d to know ing it .
I have been called to a comp an y , G T N to day for some reason .
G T N see m s to help for e i g n people who would want to mo ve to J a p an to find an a p ar t ment .
T w o month s have pass ed and I still have not made any im p ro ve ment on my or al e ng l ish . . .
U p to now , I still have n ' t had any success ful ex pe ri ence s with talk ing to a for e i g n er . It ' s re ally a sh ame on myself . . .
My school started on M on day , so I have been a little b it bu s y in the week .
I re ally feel I already need a b re a k , I know the w in ter b re a k has just finish ed though ~ ha ha .
My friend and I had nothing to do because we were c r a z y about sh op p ing .
But we went to P en n state un ive r s ity which is a very hu g e un ive r s ity .
I me t some school se c ur ity guy s and they asked us , `` A re you guy s coming here to a p p ly for co ll e g e - ent ry ex a m s ? `` , but we were just to ur is t s so we said that we did n ' t have anything to do , so we came here ~ ha ha . ``
I person ally think no body want s to visit or a p p ly for co ll e g e - ent ry ex a m s on C h ri st m as day ~ C h ri st m as is a sp e c i al ho l i day for many people , right ?
I want to go to P en n state again because we visit ed some his t or ical m us e um but they were close d so we just took some picture s of them .
To day , my room m ate w o ke me up e ar ly in the morning because she thought I was over s le e p ing .
I have been living in H an o i for 5 month s .
When I ar ri v ed in V i e t n a m 5 month s a g o , it was s um m er .
But now , it is w in ter in V i e t n a m .
M an y things happen here .
B la c k o ut s , f l o o d s , strong s un s h in e and very very hot days .
The time is pass ing by quick ly .
V i e t n a m also has w in ter .
Some time s I draw about my dr e a m ' s beautiful life on the w h ite s n ow while look ing at the s n ow .
but I have not see n s n ow any where in V i e t n a m .
S n ow never f a ll s in V i e t n a m .
I ' ll study English by la ng - 8 from now on !
B e c a us e I want to le ar n writing and speak ing in English .
However I have s n ow at my un ive r s ity town to day .
R e c ent ly , we had strange we a ther more and more .
When people are going to ce le b r ate a sp e c i al even t such as gradua tion or a sp e c i al part y , some of them prefer a large part y , while some of them prefer a small part y with a f e w close friend s and family me m b er s . W h i ch do you prefer ?
When it come s to whether we should as k as many people as possible to at ten d our gr and ce le b r ation s , this is s u e is always very thought - pro v o k ing and w or th y of serious de l i b er ation s .
Some people l o ve to invite many friend s and re l at ive s to sha re their ha p p i ness , but other s hold a world s - a p ar t opinion , be l i e v ing that the be st me m or ies should only be sh ar ed with their close friend s and family me m b er s .
P er s on ally speak ing , I prefer to ce le b r ate my im p or t ant d ate s with a l ot of people .
F ir st of all , I can make friend s with people who will probab ly help me in the future .
As a pro ver b go es , the more so c i al con ne ction s you have , the more like ly you are to have a s m o o th life .
I me t my J a p an e se teacher , R i ch ar d , at my gradua tion part y .
S up po s ing my be st friend , J a c k , had not invite d him to our part y , I could not have had the ch ance to le ar n J a p an e se from R i ch ar d .
With the help of R i ch ar d , I now work for a great ly re n ow n ed J a p an e se comp an y , M o T o S i B a , and get a de c ent salary .
There f or e , it was R i ch ar d that open ed this w in d ow for me .
S e c on d , a part y is more than just great f o o d and w in e since it is a good place to p r a c t ic e so c i al s k i ll s .
Some people may c ry out that they do not feel to t ally re la x ed if they stay in a sit u ation with f e w a c qu a in t ance s .
However , so c i al s k i ll s are re ally es s ent i al when you ent er into a comp an y .
If I had one more ch ance to p r a c t ic e my so c i al s k i ll s , I would do my ut m o st to talk to the people who I did not f a m il i ar i z e with under any circumstance s .
This point is quite o b v i ous to be understood when you comp ar e N e w Y e ar ' s E ve and your pe t ' s b ir th day .
E ver y body will agree that th ous and s of people c r ow d ing on the street d ur ing N e w Y e ar ' s E ve to ce le b r ate this wonder ful even t is far ha p p i er than ce le b r at ing their pe t ' s b ir th day at home .
The reason is , it is the number that matter s .
On the one hand , number s c re ate a good at m o s p he re , and on the other hand , no soon er s c re a m the first person than every on e in the same place get s ex cited .
T h us , the she er number of people c re ate s a j o y ful at m o s p he re .
To conc l ud e , I l o ve to as k as many people as possible to come to my part ies .
No t only can I me e t ( the ) people who might help me in the future , but also , I am able to im p ro ve my so c i al s k i ll s through the se part ies .
Besides , the more people at my part ies , the better the at m o s p he re will be .
When I go to for e i g n co un t ri es I am s c ar ed of two things :
I went to J a p an to study , but I had never st ud i ed J a p an e se before .
It is difficult to live there at the moment .
B e c a us e I c a n ' t speak J a p an e se , it ' s hard to make friend s in J a p an which make s me feel so l on e ly , and want to give up study ing in J a p an .
Even though you might have thought that we do n ' t p r a c t ic e e ar n est ly , in fact , we do .
R es ul t of To day ` s W or k
A fter a long time , I did c ar p ent ry work to day .
My physical body was de c l in ing . . .
It ` s so f r ust r at ing , but it ` s re al ity .
In the future , as long as possible , I will con t in u e to do c ar p ent ry !
When I was in S e at t le , I ro d e the bu s a f e w time s .
I re al is ed there was n ' t an an no un ce ment or in d ic ation that show s the next bu s stop ' s name .
In J a p an , there is a di g it al s c re en and an no un ce ment , which help s me re la x ti ll my de st in ation even if it is the first time us ing that bu s .
What do you think about it ?
P le a se tell me what you think .
I watch ed an interest ing new s pro g r a m this morning .
J a c k ( K i e f er S u ther l and ) came to J a p an !
A t that time , a J a p an e se person help ed him .
The man did n ' t know he is an act or .
I think the J a p an e se man could speak English .
I ho pe that I will one day speak English like him , too .
I have never spoke n English in public .
On ly in ma il and on cha t sit es .
D o you know k it ty - cha n ?
I of ten he ar that f a m ous people like L ad y G a g a l o ve it .
As for me , I did n ' t ha te it . But I did n ' t es pe c i ally like it .
I of ten ha ng out with one of my co - work er s , who m I will call `` K `` in this ent ry .
One day , she said , `` I ' ll in t ro d u ce my friend to you , because you look like you ' ll get along with my friend . ``
He is a middle - a g ed guy who se ho b b y is to co ll e c t k it ty - cha n pro d u c t s .
I was surprise d at first , but I gradua l ly got us ed to him , and I like the way `` K `` can make friend s with any body .
The guy who l o ve s k it ty - cha n look s re ally ha p p y when he get s a new it e m for his co ll e ction .
So , every time I see k it ty - cha n , I think about it like `` D o es he have this it e m ? `` , and the more I look at it , the more I feel it ' s c ut e .
My go al s in the long run
Some of my w or d s did n ' t con ve y the mean ing of what I want ed to say .
L an g u age is a too l to co m m un ic ate with people , so bad pro n un c i ation mean s bad co m m un ic ation .
When I go back to J a p an , I want to make my English better , like n at ive speak er s .
There are so many w or d s that are hard to pro no un ce for J a p an e se such as re ally , re l at ive ly , v o c a b ul ar y and so on .
There is a similar sound , but this sound is between R and L .
So J a p an e se people ' s to n gue s do n ' t get us ed to pro no un c ing them .
It see m s like there are so many difficult ies on the ro ut e to a ch i e ve my go al s .
On the 1 5 th of this month , I s an g two so ng s on the st age at my comp an y ' s end of year part y with my co ll e a gue s .
A l th ough there was some a c ous t ic trouble in the first minute , the set was large ly success ful .
E ver y on e seemed to enjoy our set and the C E O a d m ir ed my s ing ing : )
The F ir st T h an k s g i v ing ever in my life
To day is the first T h an k s g i v ing day ever in my life .
But , I was surprise d that this ho l i day is so im p or t ant to A m er ic an s .
This is like N e w Y e ar ' s D a y in J a p an .
A n y way , I will have a p ot l u c k dinner this even ing , and will go to D .
for sight se e ing tomorrow morning ! !
A or The ? A l way s an A n no y ing P ro ble m . . .
dr e ad ful ly sp ic y . . .
The le ve l of sp ic i ness was the ma x im um .
A t first `` H m m , Y e a h , This is just right ! ``
5 minute s la ter : `` O . .
My to n gue began to ting le . . ``
I had this ting ling sen s ation on my to n gue and s w e at was run n ing down my face .
1 0 minute s la ter : `` I do n ' t know why I did this .
This is a night m ar e . . . . ``
1 5 minute s la ter : `` How st up id I am !
P le a se b r ing me more water ! ``
In the end , I at e all the c ur ry , but I have a st o m a ch a ch e now .
D i ar y in English .
I will try to write a di ar y here in English .
A l th ough my mother language is C h in e se ,
I ' m not us ed to writing or think ing in English .
A l s o , I have no idea what I can write .
However , I ' ll try to keep do ing this because I want to im p ro ve my English .
And I ho pe there ' s always some on e who will c or re c t my English
To day is a middle day of the year .
In V i e t n a m we call it ' T e t D o an N g o ' .
They just had a qu ar re l a while a g o .
I felt very an no y ed .
That was what started it ! !
I tri ed to stop her s c o l d ing my da d .
`` Why not take a new to w el for your s el f `` I asked , this see m s very easy to me but it is hard for my m um .
Why c a n ' t my m um be as gentle as me ? ~ ~ ~ ha ha
I sen t an e m a il and receiv ed the re p ly .
I sen t this e m a il to the S ing a po re E c on o m ic D e ve l op ment B o ar d ' s Tokyo O f f ic e .
I receiv ed the re p ly yesterday .
It said that we could visit the Tokyo O f f ic e and talk about the visit in some in st it ut es in S ing a po re .
It is get ting e as i er ( ? ) to visit S ing a po re .
I feel ha p p y about it .
We have a re la y ra ce at our fact or y ' s sit e after work tomorrow .
It is the 6 1 st an n u al ra ce .
M an y people see m to have been look ing for w ar d to the ra ce as is the case every year .
A n y way , I l o ve run n ing and I think that other s also do .
I f in ally ar ri v ed in A ust r al i a last F ri day .
I feel like more than a month has pass ed since I ' ve been here .
That may be because my life s ty le has change d a l ot so quick ly . I c a n ' t believe I was work ing at a b an k unti l quite re c ent ly .
I do n ' t mi s s J a p an e se f o o d yet since my ho st mo m is a very good c ook .
I may mi s s s um m er in J a p an .
It ' s quite co l d here - co l d er than I expect ed .
I like to enjoy dr in k ing in a y u k at a watch ing go r g e ous f i re w or k s with m y friend s .
When I was in J a p an , I had no difficult y as k ing people th ing s and I like d talk ing to people on the street , but now , it can be difficult .
No t being able to explain what I want to say an no y s me at time s , but I will keep try ing not to us e J a p an e se , al th ough there are many J a p an e se here and some of them are us ing J a p an e se almost all the time .
I ho pe I will be able to say anything that I want to say in the near future .
I have a f e w friend s that listen to the same m us ic ( or g en re ) .
The next train always come s in a f e w minute s .
In addition , they are very ex p en s ive .
E a ch train con ne c t s to a different sub way st ation .
I some time s ch o o se the se line s because I do not need to walk far to get to the st ation from my house .
Yes , it is very easy to go to my office .
Well , when I take the easy line s , I have to a d j ust my bu d g e t at l un ch time . . . .
My first week will start in a f e w hour s time , so I will do my be st .
I qu ar re led with my friend yesterday .
I wish to be ha p p y every day , so I told myself that I should find something ha p p y in or d er to change how I was feel ing .
To day , I help ed my part n er come up with a good idea .
And a new part n er who receiv ed a P H D from A m er ic a will j o in us .
That is what made me ha p p y to day ! How about you ? D o you have any good new s for me ?
U s u ally , I make a call once a week , but the se last f e w week s I have n ' t had the time to .
On the p h on e , she said , `` Well , there ' s nothing sp e c i al going on , but I ' m wonder ing how are you do ing . `` I said , `` I ' m O K , mo m .
S or ry for not call ing . How have you been ?
`` O ur con ver s ation went on from there .
She is 8 0 now , and she re pe at s the same things when ever we talk . So our con ver s ation was the same as last time .
I listen ed to her no d d ing , `` h m . . , that ' s good . . . . o h . . . `` and my last w or d s are always the same : `` T a ke good care of your s el f M o m . ``
This p h on e call re m in d ed me of my family me m b er ' s b l o g ent ry ent it led `` R e al M o ther s `` .
`` R e al M o ther s know that a ch il d ' s gr ow th is not me as ur ed by he i g h t or gra d e . . .
She ' s way off !
4 5 year s of age - - I wonder what M o m would have thought about it .
6 5 year s of age - - I wish I could talk it over with M o m .
I ' m l u c k y and ha p p y because she is do ing so well and I ' m in a sit u ation which I can take the time to listen to her .
M o ther ' s day is coming soon , and my mother always say s , `` I do n ' t want anything . I ' m glad that you care about me . This is enough . `` when I asked her what I can do for her .
This year I some h ow found out what she want s , so I ' m going sh op p ing to find her `` a n ic e b l ous e `` .
T h an k you for c or re c ting my da ir y .
I ' m very ha p p y , but I think that I have to study English .
I ' m very co l d in my house .
I ' m having hot noodle for b re a k f a st
V ir g in i a , how are you do ing this C h ri st m as ?
I was 1 2 year s old when I first heard of your C h ri st m as story written as an ed it or i al in the N e w Y or k S un .
I was a know - it - all bo y and I became s ad at that time .
I do n ' t re m e m b er what ex a c t ly I thought , but I just did n ' t like a beautiful story that every on e would l o ve , and did n ' t think anything about it s mean ing .
V er y sorry about that , but one little ch il d has many things to think about other than a story from a for e i g n country .
No w I am old enough .
F or a gr ow n - up , I have a l ot of time to do that kind of thing .
I said I became s ad when I read this story , probab ly because I did not believe in S ant a at that time even though I knew it would be co m f or t able for me to believe in S ant a .
L o g ic has a very strong p ow er that per s u ad es any hu man being , but after all they c a n ' t live only with that .
W h o in the world would think it funny or interest ing to see a bo y saying , `` l o g ic ally to say , S ant a is my p ar ent .
So , 1 0 0 % pro b ability that he does not ex is t . `` Even the most op t im is t ic for e c aster would never think he will be ha p p y in his life .
She is far better than the l o g ical bo y . A t least comp ar ed to me because she know s how to enjoy her life without dr op p ing into the l o g ical w h ir l .
She know s this w h ir l is so p ow er ful that it draw s every on e where as she also know s this is not ne ce s s ar y to make her da i ly life ha p p y .

A n ar t ic le ex t r a c ted from a new s p a p er .
I have take n a le c ture of P u b l ic S pe a k ing since yesterday in E S L school .
However , it ' s difficult for me so I ' m think ing of cha ng ing to another class .
I ' m a poor speak er to w ar d people .
When I speak to many people , my face get s re d and my voice t re m ble s .
, but it ' s not easy .
I will take the public speak ing tomorrow but I might change it .
My ho b b y is watch ing ho r se ra c ing at the ra ce t r a c k .
I some time s be t when my favor ite ho r se run s .
But I los e almost all ra ce s I be t on .
My w if e is a ng ry when I do n ' t w in at all .
I make an effort to watch T V , rather than go to the ra ce t r a c k .
She said , `` Let ' s me e t at S h in a g a w a at no on and have l un ch to g e ther . ``
She was in front of the / a b ook st or e .
We had s us h i for l un ch .
It was ta s ty , but I was re ally b or ed because my mother ' s talk was re ally w or th less .
I de s p er ate ly end ur ed her r u b b ish story .
I at e ome le t te ri ce for l un ch to day , so I ' ll in t ro d u ce how to make it us ing some picture s .
F ir st p re p ar e some eggs ( about 3 or 4 ) and some ing r ed i ent s for ri ce .
To day I us ed an on ion and some ch ic k en me at .
And I sea s on us ing f la v or ing . He re I us e some ke t ch up for the ri ce .
The ome le t te ri ce is a very p op ul ar f o o d among ch il d re n .
D ur ing my last e ng l ish speak ing class , we le ar n ed about simple past and past con t in u e .
The teacher made us to make sen t ence s us ing simple past and past per f e c t con t in u e .
S / he then looked at our sen t ence s and point ed out some mistake s .
He said that `` I was eat ing dinner when my p ar ent s came `` can be `` se x u al . ``
I could n ' t understand , but he did n ' t want to explain .
I want to know why it can be se x u al ?
I have been enjoy ing le ar n ing English since last year but I still some time s feel de s p on d ent a little b it when I can not re m e m b er how to sp e ll a w or d by myself .
It always go es this way ; I f in ally re m e m b er a new w or d and then want to ty pe it next time , but then I for g e t again .
I am always str es s ed about how to keep a new w or d in my mind for when I need it la ter .
Some time s I consider what is the be st way to le ar n a language be s id es study ing a b ro ad since I do n ' t have much money .
M e an w h i le , I found that people have different reason s for le ar n ing English .
Some of them le ar n English to get a pro m o tion ; Some of them le ar n it for co m m un ic at ing with c ust ome r at work .
But my p ri m ar y mo t i v ation is le ar n ing just for f un .
No w I wonder if this reason is too we a k to le ar n e f f ic i ent ly , because there are f e w ch ance s to us e English at my job .
When I was at un ive r s ity , I be l on g ed to the c y c ling c l u b and tra ve led about J a p an by b ic y c le .
It is because a large part of H o k k a id o has such wide ro ad s that c y c l is t s like me can ri d e very s m o o th ly .
In addition , people in H o k k a id o are g en er ous t o c y c l is t s because a number of c y c l is t s visit there every year .
I re m e m b er many H o k k a id o people s up p or ted us by bu y ing us f o o d and something to dr in k when I went c y c ling there with my friend s .
I go to high school , and I am a st ud ent of English .
But I c a n ' t understand English gra m m ar .
So , I de c id ed to try L an g - 8 .
I want to speak & write English well and watch mo v ies in English with English sub t it le s , too .
I l o ve mo v ies , m us ic and D is ne y ! !
T h an k you for read ing my sen t ence s ! : >
I open ed the bo x , ( and ) there were l ot s of pe a ch es ( in it ) .
The ta s te was very sweet !
This is a b ook for J a p an e se people who are study ing English .
The ti t le is `` English from te x t b ook s and di ction ar ies that n at ive speak er s do n ' t us e . ``
I am le ar n ing English from this b ook , and it is simpl y interest ing : )
I think that it ' s re ally difficult to know how to us e a p re po s i tion .
We can make a sen t ence have a different mean ing by us ing a p re po s i tion .
Some th ing bad happen ed last night in T a i w an .
A n e le ction - e ve sh o ot ing happen ed A G A I N ! ! .
S i x year s a g o , one of the can d id ate s of the P re s id ent i al E le ction was sh ot by a man .
F or t un ate ly , no body got serious ly hu r t in that incident .
But this time is was different . One in no c ent v ic t im di ed and the E x - V ic e P re s id ent ' s so n was serious ly in j ur ed .
A sp e c i al f e a ture of this f an is the five b la d es .
But , I do n ' t know the di f f er ence between three b la d es and five b la d es .
They are friend s that I went to O re g on with last year , so we me t for the first time in about a year .
We talk ed about re c ent even t s such as school life , our part time job s , c l u b act i v it ies and so on .
I was re ally ha p p y to see them for the first time in a long while .
A black k i ll er who see m s strong , tra ve l s around S p a in to k i ll a person .
It just felt my s ter i ous !
I went fish ing yesterday .
My fish ing style is `` to p water fish ing . ``
Yes ter day was different .
I th re w my c a st about 3 0 time s .
I str u g g led with the fish .
I got a n ic e fish .
but , It was a c at f ish .
I want ed a black b as s .
not a c at fish . . .
I want ed a black b as s . . . .
O ur f light p l an n ed to de p ar t the N ar it a A ir P or t at four - thirty p . m .
We p re p ar ed everything for boarding and wait ed .
U n f or t un ate ly , there was very strong ra in and thunder at that time so our f light was de la y ed thirty minute s .
We board ed the p la ne at five p . m .
and ar ri v ed at the C ha ng i A ir p or t half hour behind s ch ed ul e .
It was ten - thirty p . m . by then .
B e f or e de c id ing to stay at this hotel , we c he c k ed it out on line .
O ur room was n ' t that sp e c i al , but it was n ' t too bad either .
We were sat is f i ed with our room and went to be d e ar ly so we could w a ke up e ar ly in the morning .
I could not explain ' a certain pro b ability ' in English when I talk to my friend s .
So I want to try explain here .
The pro b ability re p re s ent s how many people are watch ing particular pro g r a m in each are a .
Then , if we know a certain pro g r a m has high pro b ability comp ar e with other pro g r a m s , we might want to watch the pro g r a m even though we are n ' t interest ed in the pro g r a m .
How do you feel when you he ar sen t ence s like that ?
A re they almost same so I could us e any of them at any time ?
My job is ma k ing we b ( p c and mo b i le ) and comp ut er s y s te m s , in I ke b u ku ro .
I ' ve started a di ar y in English because I want to dis c us s new comp ut er te ch no l o g y , and I want to make friend s from around the world .
If you are stay ing or living in J a p an please con ta c t me .
but I speak very very little English .
I want to speak more English .
but first , I will le ar n to read and write in English .
P le a se sen d me a friend request if you are a n at ive English speak er .
S ha ll we help each other le ar n ?
I ' ve re al i z ed that , in J a p an , we do n ' t re ally p r a c t ic e writing and speak ing English in school s .
A l th ough we all start le ar n ing English at middle school in J a p an , there are not very many J a p an e se people who are f l u ent in it .
We even have a re p ut ation for not speak ing English .
I did n ' t know how to respon d . l o l One of my life go al s is to make J a p an a b il ing u al country .
I want to change the way English language education is hand led in J a p an e se school s .
It ' s around one in the morning but he has n ' t come home and he is dr in k ing be er some where with some on e .
He does n ' t like al c o h o l ic dr in k s .
However , some time s , he must dr in k re la ted his work with a bu y er .
L ook at the time .
He went to work yesterday .
The d ate was change d and he does n ' t get a ce ll p h on e .
I p re p ar ed a g la s s of ho ne y water and put it in the re f ri g er at or .
I ' ll go to be d now .
( ? ) We at e at the hotel .
I want ed to take a p h ot o of the great me al s , but I could n ' t because we were s ur r ound ed by a d ul t s , a d ul t s like the bo s s of the comp an y .
W i ll he go with me ( again ) ?
( F or ex amp le , I sp ent one hu n d r ed th ous and yen in a week for a home stay pro g r a m . )
There are many f a c il it ies for tra n s p or t ation like the B T S in B an g k o k .
To day at 4 a . m . , I and my father w o ke up because we heard the ga te c re a k ing .
We went there and saw my do g try ing to es c a pe .
R e c ent ly , I have been read ing co ll e ction s of po e m s and us ing a b ook about po e t ry to sea r ch for my favor ite one because I will need to us e it in a class present ation soon .
I ' ve read some po e m s before , but I have n ' t been much interest ed in po e t ry d ur ing / at any point in my life .
So If you have some favor ite po e t s and their works , I ' d like you to tell me about them .
P le a se . ^ ^
They play ed in a b as ke t b a ll game .
I have no con f id ence in my appear ance .
I ' m afraid of other people ' s eyes every day .
When I found n ic e c l o th es at the ma ll , I could n ' t ch o o se the be st one .
I ' m at a los s , does it look good on me or not .
As a re s ul t , I ch o se a b as ic and simple style .
I wish I could we ar a n ic e dress like in a ma g a z in e . !
I like to study everything around me so much .
On the other hand , I ha te to have ex a m s ,
I feel a little w or ri ed I know I can pass it But since I was a ch il d I had this feel ing .
E ar l i er , I w ro te a so r t - of di ar y on x an g a but now I ' ve just de c id ed to open up a new account - here - for the s a ke of push ing myself to write in English .
So he ll o strange r s .
I ho pe we can all get along , and than k s for c or re c ting my gra m m er here too .
I found that it is difficult to write about my da i ly life ,
so I tra n s la ted my favor ite no ve l s !
I think it ' s very hard to tra n s l ate all of the no ve l ,
So , I am going to di v id e no ve l into s ever al part s .
The woman who was 2 1 year s old c ri ed with gr i e f and walk ed
so it was natural that some people looked at me s us p ic i ous ly .
But I still could not stop c ry ing .
He was she p h er d ' s do g and had gra y eyes
When he came to my home , he was still a b a b y .
When he ra n through the c or ri d or , he s l i p p ed and l and ed on his be l ly .
I thought it was re ally c ut e , so I called his name and made him run again
and again . ( E ver y body laugh ed because he was like a mo p . )
He l o v ed eggs , ic e c re a m and pe ar s .
he some time s s qu in ted when the w in d ble w .
And D u ke k is s ed me very well .
A c t u ally almost all J a p an e se are not good at speak ing in English ,
S O , In J a p an ' s b ook st or es , you can find English te x t s easily .
To the J a p an e se , it ' s co o l to speak language s that are n ' t J a p an e se !
In addition , speak ing in English mean s we can have many friend s through o ut the world and will have t w ic e as many friend s as we have now .
I am writing to express my po s it ive impress ion s on the s er v ic es provide d by the R e ad al ot B ook C l u b and to give some suggest ion s for their im p ro ve ment .
F ir st ly , as in one piece of a d ver t is e ment , the se le ction of ti t le s is out st and ing .
I was also very please d / impress ed with the c ust ome r re v i e w f e a ture , which I found to be very us e ful indeed .
S t at ing such a draw b a c k / ter m could act u ally ( a d d to / be ne f it ) the in te g r ity of the c l u b .
In addition , I would like to see a quick er de l ive ry / ful f i ll ment s y s te m being im p le ment ed , since the per i o d of wait ing ( de l ive ry time ) is some time s as long as a who le week .
O ur first class usual ly start s at e i g h t but on T u es day , it start s at 1 0 .
I for g ot that to day is T u es day , , so I got up e ar ly .
A fter my b re a k f a st , I came back and sat on the be d . S le e p i ness came over me .

The se im age s show a w il d po l ar be ar going near te ther ed s led do g s in the w il d s of `` H ud s on B `` in C an ad a !
But , It ' s hard to believe that this po l ar be ar only need ed to hu g some on e ! _ _ _ _ !
How to get to my c ar p ar k ing sp a ce from my a p ar t ment .
U p the s ta ir s and just walk straight , so you ' ll find my re d c ar .
Yes ter day , the re s c u e started , and I watch ed the new s unti l the first person had been s a v ed .
I could n ' t watch that moment on re al time T V , but I can now .
H is t or ical even t s happen ed in the past , I thought those should be de s c ri b ed us ing past ten se .
The new s pro g r a m was made in the U S A , so I ' m sure that present ten se must be us ed to de s c ri b e his t or ical even t s .
I just dis c o ver ed this we b s ite !
I just dis c o ver ed L an g - 8 .
How come I did n ' t know about L an g - 8 before ? !
I think I need some time to look around this we b s ite .
No w , I ' m so n d ex cited .
It feel s like my English is get ting better already !
H a ve a good day !
P s y ch o l o g is t ( F ir st N ame ) S ter n b er g once propos ed that l o ve can be de v id ed into three e le ment s .
They are in t im a c y , pass ion and co m m it ment .
The in ter es ing thing ( or may b e it is un f or t un ate ) , is that me n and w ome n va l u e the se things different ly .
U s u ally me n think that pass ion is the ke y to l o ve , but w ome n consider in t im a c y or co m m it ment to be the ke y .
It ' s because w ome n sub conc i ous ly care about her ( not their ) ch il d .
And I found a very ex c it ing s ta st ic to day .
`` 2 0 % of ch il d re n are not their father ' s re al ch il d ``
I could n ' t find the so ur ce , so it could be a dis t or tion of fact .
You should con f id ent i ally consider tak ing a D N A t est before you mar ry .
But I do like the s m e ll of a S n ow ing day .
I was a little ha p p y .
There is an o il he at er in the { s ta f f } teacher ' s room .
So one of the teachers brought sweet potatoes and b ur n t it .
I change d my opinion .
I like the s m e ll and such of a co l d day .
C on d i tion al sen t ence s are one of the un it s
which I do not understand well yet .
B : If I had nothing else s ch ed ul ed , I could go with you .
A : Yes ter day we enjoy ed dr in k ing at the be er ga r d en .
B : If I had had nothing else s ch ed ul ed , I could have go ne with you .
A t time s the c at s c l im b up the con d o s and then ga ther on the ro o f t op .
I like to a p p re c i ate them la z i ly sp r a w ling on the ro o f from my b al c on y , enjoy ing the b re e z e on a s um m er night , and the s un s h in e in w in ter .
S e e ing their face s full w i th sat is f a ction make s me feel so r t of glad all day .
It ' s an interest ing sight .
Yes ter day ( was my ) first time to at ten d an English c ir c le .
We talk ed about in t ro d u c ing our s el ve s .
But we could n ' t talk so much ,
because our English s k i ll s are begin n er le ve l .
So how should we start to le ar n English in my c ir c le ?
The ty p h o on had come and the w in d was blow ing strong .
We l ock ed all the do or s but still we could the strong w in d blow ing .
A ty p h o on always mean s a good thing to me .
I was going to see her to ce le b r ate her b ir th day but my p ar ent s were on the way ( to see me ) .
They were very a ng ry which made it hard for me to make the right de c is ion .
Then s b called me and told me not to go to her home in case of bad we a ther .
When I w o ke up the w in d was still blow ing , just as I thought .
The ta s te is like H E A V E N !
It ' s so o o o de l ic i ous !
: P
I c he c k ed my answer s after the ex a m .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to see ing t ul i p s ga r d en s and w in d mi ll s .
I ' m here for the first time and I do n ' t know why but I de f in ite ly do n ' t know what to write O o
So I will tell you about my interest s ) ) )
F ir st ly , an im e I ' ve been interest ed in it for about 4 or 5 year s .
is do r a m as , not just J a p an e se but also K or e an , C h in e se and T a i w an e se . No w I have f al le n in l o ve with the K or e an do r a m a `` You ' re B e a ut i ful `` star r ing L e e H on g K i from F T I s l and and J an g K e un S u k ( B a b y and M e , B e e th o ve n V ir us ) .
And my th ir d a d d i ction is m us ic , es pe c i ally as i an m us ic . I re ally l o ve K or e an m us ic and gr o up s such as D B S K / T VXQ / T O H O S H I N K I , S H I N e e , S up er J un i or and all of their sub g ro up s , F ly to the S k y , and F T I s l and e t c .
I usual ly go to the b ook st or e d ur ing my da i ly walk .
The ti t le is `` G O A L `` .
I got los t on the way back to my house .
So , I called a tax i .
It co st me 1 0 0 0 0 yen .
T a x i far e is very ex p en s ive .
I ha te it for that reason .
How to go about bu il d ing up the or g an i z ation al s y s te m is one of the most im p or t ant de c is ion s for a comp an i e .
The se days , a f l at or g an i z ation has been consider ed one of the be st way s to mo t i v ate e m p l o y e es .
However , I f ir m ly believe that the somewhat f i er ce comp e t i tion from class if ic ation of e m p l o y e es and gra d es is ne ce s s ar y for the e f f ic i en c y of or g an i z ation s .
A b o ve all , as far as money is conc er n ed in this c a p it al is t so c i e ty , ra n k s are ne ce s s ar y for the e f f ic i en c y .
The reason that c a p it al is t so c i e t ies have been able to be de ve l op ed is d u e to the be l i e f that the we al th of the ri ch was proper ly comp en s at ed for . This has mo t i v at ed people to str ive to follow them by work ing hard , and de ve l op ing sp e c i al something .
G ive n the comp an ies in c a p it al is m so c i e ty , this case can also be a p p l i ed to the matter of ra n k s in the business world .
If there is no different i ation in the con se qu ence of work , e m p l o y e es would think that there would be no need for work .
I went home yesterday for the Q ing M ing F est i v al .
To day I got up at 7 a m , after which I asked ( my ) mo m to visit gr and p a .
Yes ter day , I ver if i ed the so ur ce co d e that us es D ow J on es In d ust ri al In d e x .
I found that if the D J I is over 1 0 0 0 0 point then the T S re d u ce s to one de c im al place , or else it re d u ce s to two de c im al place .
It should be display ed as 2 de c im al place s .
I ' m look ing for the reason why . I have to set it so that it show s c or re c t ly .
Why do I live .
It ' s a wonder .
I p re p ar ed b re a k f a st for my d aught er and my hu s b and .
A fter they left , I began to c le an the room , do the was h ing , water the f l ow er and so on .
It was almost no on when I finish ed all of the house w or k .
No w it is my time .
I can watch my favor ite dr a m a , or read b ook , or listen to m us ic .
However , I have only three or four hour s to re la x .
Why is there no ho l i day for a house w if e ?
I could n ' t go to my English less on .
B e c a us e , I made a mistake !
I came at the wrong time .
( It start s at 1 0 : 4 0 but I went at 1 1 : 4 0 )
I was so s ad and up se t with myself !
N e x t , I went to the s w im m ing po o l with my friend s .
A fter s w im m ing , we went out for a dr in k to As a g a y a and K o en j i .
I got too dr un k or I dr un k too much .
I got a very very bad ha ng o ver this morning .
I did n ' t mo ve ti ll the after no on . . .
This p r a y was de e p under g r ound . ( ? )
I almost took it to the c he c k - out co un ter ,
but I thought about b ook s .
This dress co st s t w ic e as much as
I turn ed around , and put it back .
The sh op p ing ma ll is f il led with so much te m p t ation .
I think that what sh op p ing for me is the same as what
A week a g o , in the p ar ish C h ur ch of the T w o S a in t s , a s u ic id e bo m b er k il led 2 3 w or s h i p p er s coming out of mi d night ma s s .

One of the ma j or go al s : To provide new ti t le s and off er reason able salary a d j ust ment s for the e m p l o y e es .
The most l o g ical so l u tion is to off er new ti t le and salary in c re a se for s ta f f me m b er s .

I have no pro ble m s because I live in N ar a .
But my gr and f a ther live s in F u ku s h im a .
F u ku s h im a is very close to the c ent er of the e ar th qu a ke ! !
I only keep re se ar ch ing the i nformation about this are a .

But in J a p an having English s k i ll s is more im p or t ant for job hu n ting . . .
So I ' d like to b r us h up my English and G er man speak ing s k i ll s .
I ' m a second - year co ll e g e st ud ent in Tokyo .
I ' m tak ing the G er man class .
I l o ve m us ic , so I ' m interest ed in e th n ic m us ic .
One is the r ock b and c l u b .
The other is the j a z z b and c l u b .
I play the so p r an o and al t o s a x .
I had be ha v ed bad ly to w ar d s her .
I re g re t ted
it la ter on . . .
Y e t still , when I ar r ive home , she appear s glad , and when I am sit ting in the living room , come s close to me .
I saw a mo v i e yesterday .
U s u ally I have to pay 1 8 0 0 y en for a mo ive but yesterday it was 1 0 0 0 y en .
R e ad ing the no ve l s is f un though . X D ha ha
a u g ly w ome n
How to keep a beautiful appear ance is the e ter n al dr e a m of w ome n .
But the one who p ur s u e only the out er be a ut y is the u g l ies t person in the world , is n ' he ?
L ook ing back at my life in the U S
As I look back on my life in the U S , there are so many things which ga ve me a sh ock . In other w or d s , c ul t ur al sh ock s .
In the first days I got to the U S , I found some people having se x in the bath ro o m .
I also me t three ga y people k is s ing at the same time at a part y .
O f course , the fact that most people ha b it u ally s m o ke we ed is also s ur p ri s ing to me .
O ther than those , the c r a z y dr in k ing of co ll e g e students , and people who always keep their do or open even when some on e is follow ing them were also sh ock ing .
A l th ough those c ul t ur al di f f er ence s are to t ally new for me and some time s s c ar ed me , I ' ve kept try ing to a d a p t to the c ul ture of the U S .
A fter that , I found that I like this c ul ture , and I ' m more like an A m er ic an .
So far , my life in the U S is going well , but when it come s to my English , I ' m still not sat is f i ed with it .
I ' ll keep try ing to find out more about the people and the c ul ture .
But we almost got de la y ed follow ing the time t able because we could n ' t con t ro l the tra f f ic and there were many one way ro ad s .
F or t un ate ly we were there on time because of good dr i v ing .
I do a do u ble ma j or in B us i ness and C h in e se .
The reason I have a do u ble ma j or was because I could see the world was head ing to w ar d s a g l o b al e c on o m y and so c i e ty .
I w an n a get l ot s of va ri ous ex pe ri ence s from people of different c ul ture .
As his p im p le s are clear ing up , I expect ed the do c t or would give his gr e en light to go to kind er g ar ten .
It is l o c at ed in the so u ther n part of J a p an , and it is made up of a l ot of ti n y is l and s .
A l s o , O k in a w a is f a m ous in that it has many b a se ment s .
because yesterday was my you ng er brother ' s b ir th day .
A fter 9 / 1 1 , A m er ic a see m s to be los ing it s p ow er in ter n ation ally .
A ll we can do is turn a b l in d e y e and have an op t im is t ic view , may b e .
I w o ke up at 7 A M this morning .
There is a beautiful morning g l ow .
But I feel w ar m th , p ow er and en er g y from the s un .
When I saw this morning scene , I thought all things will go s m o o th ly to day .
A fter school , I went to the C ent re l i b r ar y in I la c with my s is ter .
( And ) I st ud i ed for about 2 hour s and then I went to home .
When my s is ter and I were c ook ing a s te a k , M ic ha el who is the l and l or d to my house asked us , `` D id you bu y a desk ? `` But at that time we did n ' t bu y a desk yet .
So , we went to I K E A to bu y a desk with M ic ha el after we had dinner .
It took 1 0 minute s by c ar .
I K E A was very big and there were many things such as desk s , p i ll ow s and d u ve t s .
We b ough t two la p t op t able s , re d and black .
It ' s about 4 0 E ur o , a reason able p ri ce .
A n y way ( s ) , I b ough t a desk to day .
It ' s a little small , but it ' s enough for me .
I ' m going sha ng ha i world in ter n ation al ex po s i tion next month !
I ' m work ing at mo b i le p h on e c ar ri er in J a p an , like T - mo b i le in U S A .
They are sp on s or s for S ha ng ha i world in ter n ation al ex po s i tion , and provide high sp e ed mo b i le ne t w or k there .
This is my first time to visit in C h in a , I look for w ar d to it .
In fact , I would like to look for a friend who like s us ing S k y pe and M S N and usual ly cha t s on S k y pe . I ho pe to cha t with him / her on S k y pe to im p ro ve my or al English , and I will tea ch him / her P ut on g h u a . I can speak stand ar d P ut on g h u a . If I can find a friend like this , we can make a conc re te p l an to help each other . If he / she want s , ex c ept teaching C h in e se , I also can tell her / him what he / she want s to know about C h in a .
Why am I so e age r to im p ro ve my or al English ?
That ' s because I will be on a bu s s i ness tri p to C h ic a g o .
I ho pe I will be able to co m m un ic ate with the n at ive s effect ive ly .
So , any body who want s to le ar n P ut on g h u a and will help me , con ta c t me . T h an k s . I am on line all the time .
O h h h h ~ ~ It ' s so great to know about this place : )
H o pe I can keep up le ar n ing , no matter whether in English or F re n ch . . .
I ' m now a s al es re p re s ent at ive who just gradua ted from un ive r s ity and p l an to study a b ro ad 2 year s from now .
A n y way ~ enjoy and than k you !
The c r ow appeared soon and ga ve them a large p ot , then he explain ed : `` If you turn your l ad le to the right side in the p ot , it will give you po l o [ 1 ] and if you turn it to the left side , the p ot will give you s te w [ 2 ] .
The old co up le ha p p i ly took the p ot home . They invite d all their ne i g h b or s and re l at ive s for dinner and they f ed them all .
Some days after that the j e al ous ne i g h b or request ed the p ot , saying that they had some gue st s that night . The simple - heart ed old woman hand ed the p ot to him , but he never ga ve it back .
U n f or t un ate ly the v i ll age ' s K h an ' s s er v ant s w it ness ed what happen ed and took the don ke y by for ce as the K h an ' s proper ty .
The co up le were so un ha p p y about los ing the c r ow ' s g if t , they de c id ed to try the c r ow once more .
To day , I read one ar t ic le about how , many U .
ch il d re n are s u f f er ing from e ar in f e ction s re c ent ly , in U S A T O D A Y .
I was so s ad that they are s u f f er ing from the dis e a se .
A l s o , there are no effect ive treat ment s against the dis e a se .
I ho pe this sit u ation will change for the be n if it of our ch il d re n .
He was so dis a p po in ted with his c ur r ent circumstance s that have been both er ing him .
I could n ' t do anything but he ar his comp la in t .
But I would be re ally gr ate ful if I could he al his s ad ness .
There are good things and also bad things in our business life .
We c a n ' t be always in n ic e sit u ation s .
I think that the most im p or t ant thing to have to de al with the se hard s h i p s is to keep a po s it ive mind what ever the circumstance is .
I saw the new s to day about a `` S l ut w al k `` that ' s happen ing in the U S A and C an ad a .
The w ome n who were told ' do not walk like a s l ut ' by police in C an ad a , became a ng ry and la un ch ed a ( this ) c amp a i g n .
I think the police should have w or d ed it more care ful ly , but they spoke the tru th . ? ?
How they be ha ve is their ch o ic e , but there are n ' t only gentle m en in the world .
O ur ch o ic es de s er ve respect , but we should take respon s i b il ity for our ch o ic es .
I just wish se x u al at ta c k s would stop , however I do n ' t think that will happen .
`` J ud as `` by L ad y G a g a and `` To x ic `` by B ri t ne y S pe ar s
I like L ad y G a g a and B ri t ne y S pe ar s .
B e c a us e I think L ad y G a g a is po s it ive and an un p re j ud ic ed person and B ri t ne y is se x y !
One of the so ng s is J ud as and the other is To x ic .
D e f in ite ly I tra n s la ted those w or d s , but I do n ' t understand the mean ing s . What do they want to say ?
When I was a un ive r s ity st ud ent , I was a me m b er of the s k i tea m .
The E n d of O ver d r ive
I have finish ed my last ex a m , da m n , it is so wonder ful !
It was very hard to do it with the least co st .
Well , it look s like that it tired me out , I ' m sit ting with b l o o d s h ot eyes at the comp ut er and I ' m sleep y because I went be d over 5 hour s la ter than usual .
H a p p i ly I came to my sen se s in time .
No w is the time to re la x and f in ally have f un !
I just found out about it yesterday .
It is a C an ad i an co f f e e sh op .
They have a l ot of co f f e e sh op s other than S t ar b a c k s in C an ad a !
It is so difficult for me because I did n ' t know how to or d er in English . . .
A n y way , I should n ' t he s it ate just to bu y co f f e e ! !
So , I de c id ed to ent er the co f f e e sh op !
I said `` A h - . . .
D o u ble - do u ble ! ! ``
B y the way , `` D o u ble - do u ble `` mean s two s u g ar and two mi l k s ! !
I was told about it by my ho st family !
I am ha p p y to be like a C an ad i an ! !
E ver y th ing will be a great pleasure !
I me t some people d ur ing my A m er ic an friend ' s b ir th day dinner part y last even ing .
I me t my friend ' s friend s , my friend ' s c ous in , and my c ous in ' s friend .
The f o o d was o k a y , p ri ce was o k a y , and the at m o s p he re was o k a y .
The girl s talk ed f a st .
I could n ' t catch up with the sp e ed of the n at ive speak er ' s speech .
My J a p an e se friend could catch up with it .
I ' ve been stay ing here almost three month s .
I spoke only some gr e e ting s yesterday .
I ' m usual ly a talk at ive person , but I was re ally quiet yesterday .
I can understand English .
A c t u ally , sp e ed is im p or t ant for c as u al con ver s ation .
I still do n ' t find a new job . . .
But , I ' ll go to a in ter v i e w to night .
and there is an another in ter v i e w tomorrow .
I ' m an x i ous . . .
I knew there was a di f f er ence of sp el ling between A m er ic an English and B ri t ish English .
But then , all the people who I talk ed with spoke f a st , and my understand ing of English was poor , comp ar ed to the present .
( Yes , I still have a poor command of English . . . )
How do most A m er ic an people feel about B ri t ish English ?
W h i ch English do E ur o pe an people le ar n ?
I think here , in J a p an , we study A m er ic an English .
And g en er ally , the g l o b al stand ar d might be A m er ic an English .
Some on e , please tell me , what is the big g est di f f er ence between them ?
H i ~ every on e
I have p r a c t ic ed play ing the ha r m on ic a for two month s .
G o l d en week is a gr o up of ho l i day s in J a p an .
G o l d en week come s at the end of A p ri l .
My you ng er s is ter is much more bu s y than I am .
She is work ing a l ot of hour s every day .
She always has a l ot of over time .
The work is n ' t over unti l P M 1 0 : 0 0 .
She has no days off .
I am big g in er begin n er in e ng l ish .
I think my di ar y need s a l ot of c or re ction .
However , this se m est er students from two different gr o up s some time s have their class es j o in ed and are sea ted to g e ther .
F or ex amp le to day , we had our class at 8 : 1 5 a m . ( D ot here , not co m m a ) . I got there at 8 : 1 3 a m .
O h , my go d ! It was full of people in our class ro o m .
F or t un ate ly , my friend re s er v ed a sea t for me .
So I think I should be e ar l i er than before for the re st of the se m est er .
B e c a us e I ' m s c ar ed of mo s qu it o s . I ha te them .
My friend said that ' s because of my b l o o d ty pe .
We will have our class es from 8 : 1 5 to 1 2 : 0 0 , and 1 4 : 4 0 to 1 6 : 1 0 .
I only have 1 1 class es per week .
The class I like most is P E , because I can play v o ll e y b a ll .
Y e a h , this is my favor ite sp or t .
If we have class , we must go , because the teacher will c he c k .
This is un like some other co un t ri es .
One of my friend s is an It al i an and he can ch o o se if he want to go to school .
This punishment will be that you t c a n ' t a p p ly for the s ch o l ar s h i p .
But it ' s ex c it ing to c ook in your dormitory .
O k , that ' s some of my school .
I ' m re ally ha p p y to j o in
That was so e ar ly , like the time a ch il d would go to be d .
E ver y body say s that is so many !
They are all girl s and also small do g s .
The ir re l ation s h i p with each other is very good .
I think they are just like my re al ch il d re n .
I should go to be d now
because I have class tomorrow at 9 a m
but I c a n ' t stop myself from watch ing a T V s er ies .
I have found a new T V s er ies name d G h o st W h is p er .
I started from S e as on four
but I think I can f i g ur e out the story .
It ' s about a woman who can see g h o st s and talk to them !
it ' s re ally co o l though
but I ' d rather be a normal person who C A N ' T see those g h o st s .
if I could see a g h o st ,
I would me e t my go d m o ther .
she pass ed away two year s a g o because of some strange pro ble m s with her heart
it happen ed all of a s ud d en ,
I have so many things I want to say to her ,
I w an n a tell her how much I l o ve her ,
and how much I a p p re c i ate her ,
also I wish I could see my do g ,
it was the most c ut e and kind do g I ever me t ,
I mi s s it . I mi s s them both .
No matter .
I think I should go to sleep !
A ll the train in Tokyo me t ro po l it an are a was comp le te ly stop p ed ( or ha l ted ) .
I was un c er tain if I want ed to walk home as it was about 2 0 k m away , but I did it .
A t work , my ce ll p h on e did n ' t work as the te le c o m m un ic ation s c able s were de st ro y ed by the qu a ke .
What is w or se is that the bu se s were too c r ow d ed to ri d e and there were lack of tax ies ( ? ) .
A fter I re a ch ed home , I knew the sit u ation was much more serious in no r th e a st of J a p an .
That ' s why I ' m here , to im p ro ve my English s k i ll s and to s ur v ive un ive r s ity life .
You can le ar n T ha i language in every day life in my t w it ter account , and if you have a question ,
I c a n ' t pass the entrance ex a m ( the un ive r s ity I want to ent er the most ) .
In my sp ar e time , I like to try to re la x .
S u ch as read ing some wonder ful no ve l s , or watch ing a l ot of mo v ies with a c up of tea .
bu ng e e j um p ing is a great past im e , because I like the feel ing it b r ing s to me ! I feel thoroughly re la x ed from da i ly str es s .
In my world , there are good way s to sp en d my sp ar e time ^ 0 ^
I look for w ar d to us ing it more of ten .
This was my first time j o in ing a sight se e ing to ur a b ro ad .
I see m to have less en er g y than they do .
However , you c a n ' t de n y how c r u el the re al world is .
A ll I can do is keep myself on the right p a th and try to be ha p p y at all time s .
The other day I tri ed tak ing a T O E I C T est .
My go al will take a long time to a ch i e ve . . .
cause s the town serious pro ble m s .
la b or er s will be old er .
The town already has a large number of
old people , and the p op ul ation s up p or ting the old will be de c re as ed
w ow , this is my first po st and I still do n ' t have any idea what to write about .
I am le ar n ing English and J a p an e se now and I ho pe every on e in this we b s ite can help me to im p ro ve them .
It was difficult to up ro ot the se .
I have ex pe ri ence d a C an ad i an N e w Y e ar for the first time .
I prefer a C an ad i an N e w Y e ar ce le b r ation to a J a p an e se one .
B e c a us e the dinner was very go r g e ous and y um m y ! !
I do n ' t like tra d i tion al J a p an e se N e w Y e ar dis he s .
I mean , l ow in s al t , l ow in f at . . .
The only thing I like in all are J a p an e se ri ce c a ke s .
On the other hand , to day we had a l ot of f e a st s that f il led the t able .
R o a st be e f , m ash ed potatoes , p in e n ut s ro ll ( this is that stuff ing s which con s is t s of p in e n ut s , f l o ur , me at and so on is rolled into p i e she e t or something ) and de s s er t with e g g no g ( this is a kind of dr in k .
M il k , eggs and s u g ar are mi x ed to g e ther .
M an y C an ad i an s like this .
While having dinner , I explain ed how we ce le b r ate the N e w Y e ar in J a p an .
The mean ing s of each dis h , N e w Y e ar ' s g if t s and so on .
They do n ' t have c ust o m s like N e w Y e ar ' s g if t s .
That ' s what I like about the J a p an e se way of ce le b r at ing the N e w Y e ar .
I would like to in t ro d u ce a se v ent e en year old girl .
He r name is M i o .
One day , the girl had an op p or t un ity to visit the no r ther n country .
She l o ve s the at m o s p he re , so she str o ll s through the for est every morning d ur ing her stay .
She usual ly str o ll s le is ur e ly about the c amp us in the morning .
This is how it all started .
This we a ther is called p l um ra in s sea s on .
I ho pe it would clear up as soon as possible , do n ' t in ter r up t my tri p .
I me t the people who will tra ve l to E ur o pe with me
I me t the people who are going to tra ve l to E ur o pe with me .
We were just look ing for w ar d to going to E ur o pe .
I went to see some big p l ant s .
There were a l ot of L ot us f l ow er s .
I went there with my a un t and a l it le girl .
We walk ed pass the ri ce f i el d and past the man g o tree and then we went to see a beautiful L ot us not far from there .
I had f un and was re ally surprise d because of my friend who called me .
In that place there ' s no te le p h on e sign al and no money on my p h on e so I did not re p ly re c ent ly , but then when my p ar ent s took me the c ity I had re f il led my money and sen t the me s s age back to her .
she told me some on e from J a p an was think ing of me too .
who is my close friend I am think ing of her too while I was not in B an g k o k
I am hung ry and I would like to eat something . .
He y friend s do you think my new a v at ar look s la z y ?
y e h h I see that ha ha . .
so just some picture and in B an g k o k is o k a y now do n ' t get w or ri ed I think every thing is going to be better . .
A d d A ut o S a ve D r a f t
D e ar L an g - 8 us er s ,
T h an k you for us ing our s er v ic e .
I ' m Ka z u k i .
One of the ma j or comp la in t s we ' ve heard from our us er s is that , `` I sp ent the who le time to write an ent ry look ing up every other w or d in the di ction ar y , and a c c id ent ly los t everything , and had to begin again . ``
To p re v ent such incident to happen , to night we im p le ment the A ut o S a ve D r a f t f e a ture .
This works like G m a il `` dr a f t s a ve `` f e a ture .
It will a ut o s a ve your do c u ment s every 3 0 second s after you begin ty p ing .
If you want to man u ally s a ve your do c u ment just c l ic k the `` S a ve as D r a f t `` but t on .
If the comp ut er a ut o m at ic ally sh ut s down ,
L o g back on the `` W ri te a new ent ry `` p age and ch o o se the ent ry from the `` D r a f t s `` corner on the left co l um n , which I point ed out in the im age at ta ch ed on this ent ry .
I ho pe , from now on , our us er s will be more en c o ur age d to sp en d more time writing new ent ri es .

The T O E I C t est
It take s about 1 5 0 minute s con s is ting of listen ing and read ing se ction s .
We have to keep conc ent r at ing through o ut this time .
I have been study ing hard for it .
D o you mean , `` This is my four th time tak ing this ex a m `` ?
I will do my be st , in or d er to get a high s c or e on the ex a m .
The F ir st T h re e D a y s of the N e w Y e ar
When I saw his picture s , I felt like time stop p ed .
My friend said , `` H is works are wonder ful .
I like his picture s . ``
I was able to re la x and feel re fresh ed at the start of the N e w Y e ar .
I ' m writing th e w or d s of a so ng .
How can I tell you ?
I ' ll never know the reason for our ex is t ence .
J un e is J a p an ' s ra in sea s on .
The we a ther is bad the ent i re day .
But while run n ing , it started to ra in .
A t least I did n ' t catch a co l d , but still it was ter ri ble .
I ho pe the ra in sea s on will end e ar ly !
Yes ter day my friend s and I went to school , and had an English speak ing less on .
We gradua ted from high school ( F e b . 8 was gradua tion ce re m on y ) in fact ,
, but we asked a teacher to give us an English speak ing class even after the ce re m on y .
The class was very interest ing to us ,
es pe c i ally `` The G u es s ing G ame ! ! ``
The point of the game is to answer what is written on the paper that is a b o ve answer er ' s head .
A no ther person give s a hi n t to the answer er .
It is difficult to give a hi n t and answer ,
A H and y C le ar F o l d er With in T e x t b ook ( B r us h ed up )
then walk ing with my b a g would be like train ing to full f i ll my ability to c ar ry more we i g h t .
I do n ' t have the s k i ll to c ar ry a he a v i er b a g , ,
I copie d my te x t b ook into half s i z e , and so r t them out a ccord ing to each per i o d .
When I leave my house ,
I p ic k up the ne ce s s ar y part for the day ' s study .
I put the se part s into a half of ty p ing s i z e clear f o l d er .
I can put this clear f o l d er into all of my b a g s with a half of ty p ing s i z e not e b ook .
So I get the op po t un ity to study in every sit u ation .
I think it is effect ive to in c re a se the f re qu en c y of study ing to get the ne ce s s ar y s k i ll s .
Why do n ' t you make a u b i qu it ous study ing en v ir on ment ?
I have not go ne out at all since my school finish ed .
I feel that I want to go out or want to see my friend s , al th ough I ' ve done nothing in my house re c ent ly .
The first reason : I have a l ot of home w or k ( ? ) .
W h i ch I have not even start work ing on yet .
The second reason : I need to s a ve money unti l I gradua te .
Let me tell you what happen ed d ur ing the week en d .
On S un day , I was very bu s y p re p ar ing to sen d my students to their country , K or e a .
O ther teachers and I went to the a ir p or t , and we did some pro c ed ur es to ent er the a ir p or t ga te .
But we mi s s ed the a ir p la ne !
We mi s s ed our a ir line .
We were 1 0 minute s l ate .
We be g g ed for help but the st ud ent ' s sea t s
We went back home and wait ed for va c ant sea t s .
F or t un ate ly , there were enough sea t s for go all students to go back to K or e a , al th ough It took a quite long time to get them .
The man g o p ud d ing which I of ten p ur ch a se con s is t s of four la y er s , each a little different in co l or and f la v or .
A ll the la y er s are in ha r m on y with one another ! !
It ' s the first time I have visit ed this sit e
In two month , I will be in ter v i e w ed in English to ent er a comp an y
M o st of the time , I only listen and read .
I think that is the reason why I c a n ' t speak and write English
I sea r ch ed for a good we b s ite to help me study English and f in ally I found this sit e
I ' ll help those who want to study K or e an . I need you help
I s the follow ing sen t ence gra m m at ic ally c or re c t ?
We are the me m b er s of P h ot o g r a p h y C l u b .
We will try to j o in t - p ur ch a se a new came r a with good perform ance .
It ' s very good but too ex p en s ive .
I think that it see m s to be good , small and c he a p .
What per c ent age dis c o un t can you give ?
C an you off er a little b it more dis c o un t ?
So let ' s make a de c is ion .
1 7 / 1 0 / 1 0 - B B Q at the p ar k
We were p l an n ing to go to the Z o o , but every on e was bu s y work ing .
So we c ance ll ed it .
S in ce it was s un n y , I went to the near est p ar k with my room m ate .
We had a B B Q at C le l and P ar k .
The p ar k is e qu i p p ed with a he ar ing de v ic e , so unless we c le an after eat ing we can us e it .
In addition , There are some ten n is co ur t s next to the p ar k !
I always feel like play ing it al th ough I c a n ' t play very well .
We talk ed about job s and the mar ri age able age of different co un t ri es .
I am not sure if we can dr in k in public place .
In J a p an , it is O K .
What about in your country ?
To day , I le ar n ed about was h ing a ga st ro c ame r a machi ne in my c l in ic for the first time .
A ll the while I was very care ful not to f a ll down into it .
B e c a us e I heard that my do c t or had pai d about 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 J P Y for it .
So it ' s very ex p en s ive .
I was re ally surprise d by that .
I ' d be able to bu y a c ar if I had such an am o un t of money .
And I could n ' t help myself if I f e ll in it .
So I ' m very serious / care ful when was h ing it .
And I enjoy ed was h ing the came r a .
I ' m always ha p p y do ing work .
Well ,
My girl f ri en d / friend will be get ting mar ri ed this year in M on t an a .
She is one of my close friend s but she is like a like you ng er s is ter or family me m b er so I have been feel ing ha p p y about it .
I ' ll be there when she has the w ed d ing ce re m on y .
Yes ter day , I w ro te in my j o ur n al , but no body c he c k ed it .
or the them e is just b or ing .
To day , I went sh op p ing to bu y ch o c o l ate .
M o st J a p an e se people like sweet s ch o c o l ate s with c ook ies O R ch o c o l ate c ook ies .
On ly ch o c o l ate is not so p op ul ar for most j a p an e se .
B e c a us e J a p an e se people like c ar b o h y d r ate s .
As you already know , they always eat ri ce and noodle as a s ta p le f o o d .
So , I think that ' s why J a p an e se people like to eat something with c ar b o h y d r ate s .
There f or e , M o st J a p an e se like sweet ch o c o l ate with c ook ies .
F ir st , I study English for three hour s every day right after work .
A l th ough you know it is an in e v it ably natural pro ce s s , it is hard not to think about it too much .
My father is 5 5 year s old this year , but in s te ad of ma k ing an effort to keep he al th y by ex er c is ing like his pe er s , my father prefer s sp en d ing l ot s of time b r ow s ing new s on the in ter ne t .
I re ally wish all his sign s of a g ing could be s l ow ed ( down ) , or at least not that o b v i ous , but the fact is that I can clear ly and strong ly sen se all of them , which is re ally pai n ful .
We took an e ar ly bath and at e to s h i k o s h i - so b a , the bu c k w he at noodle s eat en on N e w Y e ar ' s E ve .
So now I can re la x .
My ne i g h b or s ar e having a part y and I have been he ar ing L at in m us ic since this after no on .
It started ra in ing a while a g o , but the m us ic did n ' t stop
I part ic i p at ed in a ma t ch of ten n is to day .
I be l on g to the comp an y ' s ten n is tea m , and to day was an open ing ma t ch for this sea s on .
We w on the first set but we los t the second set .
F in ally , we los t the f in al set .
It was such a close ma t ch and we play ed for about 2 and a half hour s .
And I felt the s ting of de f e at b e c a us e we los t such a close game .
I ' ll p re p ar e better for the ma t ch next week .
P la y ing ten n is is so f un and re l i e ve s my str es s .

D o you know ' L ad y O s c ar : R o se of V er s a il le s ' ?
But she dress es like a man , because of her p ar ent s )
She looked per f e c t for me when I was you ng .
I thought she was very strong , n ic e , and hand s ome ( or pretty )
even though she was a girl .
My English name , ' O s c ar ' ,
cause s me to re m e m b er this .
, star r ing J o h n n y D e p p .
The mo v i e start s when J ame s M at th e w B ar ri e , an English dr a m at is t , me e t s the bo y who is the mo d el for P e ter P an .
I did n ' t know how `` P e ter P an `` was written , so this story was so in ter st ing .
I ' ll have l ot s of time to le ar n English next month
B e c a us e the b an qu e t room s which I work at will be va c ant on the month .
It ' s a good thing , ex c ept that my s a v ed money will be di m in ish ing without me r c y .
It ' s not that I ' m not sat is f i ed with the time and money I have ,
but it ' s a b it short of feel ing we al th y .
I think the reason is that my c ur r ent job is not the job I re ally l o ve .
A l th ough I do n ' t ha te my job and I rather like my co ll e a gue s .
But I a v o id ed the hard s h i p , as a re s ul t , I now stand in this place .
I ' m no long er you ng enough to change my job .
That we a p on is English .
This is my home w or k for my English writing class .
Let me in t ro d u ce myself .
I ' m a st ud ent at In ch e on U n ive r s ity ma j or ing in I nformation C o m m un ic ation s , an I T ma j or .
My family is comp ri s ed of four me m b er s : my father , mother , old er brother , and me .
My father dr ive s a bu s and my mother is a house w if e .
A l s o , my old brother at ten d s K on g j u U n ive r s ity and his ma j or is to ur is m .
He is p re p ar ing ( ? ) for va ri ous con t est s .
D ur ing the second half of the year , I always p l an out what to do next year .
I have some time s heard `` You l o ve to p l an ~ `` . I am read ing b ook s re la ted to my future and my favor ite C E O is S te ve n J o b s , the C E O of A p p le .
So I read b ook s re la ted to S te ve n J o b s too .
I also like f i ction b ook s from J a p an . ( man g a ? )
So I will in c re a se my ex pe ri ence with mo b i le p l at f or m s and find my se c re t pass ion . ( ? )
B e c a us e I was called by the un ive r s ity .
The un ive r s ity said I pass ed the entrance ex a m in ation .
I will look f ow ar d to my un ive r s ity life .
No w it is 2 2 : 0 0 o ' clock .
To m or r ow will be bu s y .
A w in d y day
It has been w in d y since last night .
I can feel the w in d s a little inside the a p ar t ment , even though all the w in d ow s are close d . ( since my a p ar t ment is old )
He will be gradua ting from j un i or high school and ent er ing high school this year .
You need to take an ex a m to ent er high school .
My father w or ri es / is w or ri ed about him ,
But there ' s a l ot of new v o c a b ul ar y in the b ook , I can gue s s to some ex t ent or cha ll e ng e myself to understand those mean ing s though : s
I ' m c ur i ous about when I will finish read ing this b ook : x
I have us ed a f e w of we b b r ow s er s which are In ter ne t ex p l or er , F i re f o x , S a f ar i and G o o g le ch r ome . ( co up le = 2 )
I can s a ve time and feel co m f or t able .
Besides , the us er friend ly in ter f a ce is at t r a c t ive .
But some time s I am an no y ed by b i z ar re op tion s .
A c t u ally , I was n ' t able to see p d f f il es in ch r ome .
F in ally , I so l v ed the is s u e by ent er ing some ke y w or d into the address b ar and ch o se en able to see p d f in C h r ome .
F or now , there is no comp la in t about C h r ome .
C o ul d you tell me how different the se two express ion are :
M or e o ver , I read an English - tra n s la ted J a p an e se co m ic and in the man g a , a character say s something like this :
( This is from my me m or y , so may b e there are some co m m as but I do n ' t have the co m ic to con f ir m that now )
The di f f er ence in how to us e sub j e c t s and c ar d in al number s between # 1 ~ # 3 is not clear to me .
In my comp an y
E ver y on e want s to be the N O 1 .
So some time s , I c a n ' t show my conc er n in the comp an y .
I want to have f un every day .
My bo s s said to me `` F in ish off this job by next T u es day `` .
This job is almost finish ed , but there are a f e w mistake s .
I do not know what my mistake s are .
A th le te ' s f o ot
I ' ve got a th le te ' s f o ot .
It started a long time a g o . It was around my high s ch o o l days that I first got a th le te ' s f o ot , so it has been almost a de c ad e .
But I ne g le c ted to treat it .
I of ten feel an it ch between my to es .
I de c id ed that I do n ' t need to leave them b e .
So I went to a de r m at o l o g is t down t ow n .
He p re s c ri b ed me an o in t ment and took some b l o o d ( ? ) for a live r t est .
The do c t or look s care ful and probab ly c r ed i ble but since I am for now tra n s la ting one do c t or ' s b ook which c ri t ic i z es do c t or s who are too read i ly `` put ting their p at i ent s on c he m ical s `` I am a b it n er v ous .
But I have no ch o ic e for my c le an feet in the short ter m .
I will f a i th ful ly follow his in st r u ction s first .
The public he al th care in s ur ance co ver ed way more than half of the to t al me d ical b i ll .
A n y way s , I ho pe this s um m er I can we ar f a b ul ous s and al s to show off c ut e to es and c le an feet .
I feel very tired and s ad the se days , there are so many ex a m s to p re p ar e for , which are rather difficult .
D o you know of the J a p an e se w or d `` mi k k b o u z u `` ?
`` M i k k a b o u z u `` mean s some on e w h o c a n ' t st ic k to anything for long .
This w or d a p p l ies to me .
I am a g en u in e fool .
I am going to con t in u e to write this di ar y and im p ro ve my English s k i ll .
B y the way , how should I do to make for e i g n friend s ?
I work ed outside only we ar ing a down j a c ke t , I sh ive r ed from the co l d w in d .
So I ' m going to be d with re l i e f ! !
I heard the s ad new s about my friend s .
This s ad new s is that my friend qu it his job .
He normal ly works bu s i ly and had not spoke n about his dis t re s s in his comp an y .
I S a w a M o v i e
I saw a f il m with R o b er t D ow ne y J r . , I ro n M an .
In it he is very hand s ome and s m ar t .
In the mo v i e when he was 1 7 , he gradua ted from M I T , one of the most f a m ous school s in the world .
It show s us the va ri ous side s & n b s p ; of M J ' s character .
In `` The way you make me feel `` , he seemed in no c ent as a ch il d .
In `` C a n ' t stop l o v ing you `` , he was tender and full of l o ve .
In `` B i ll i e J e an `` , he was a b s o l ut e ly se x y !
In `` M an in the mi r r or `` , he was a tru e s up er star .
I c ri ed so much , it cause d me a & n b s p ; head a ch e .
I want to say than k you to K en n y O r te g a ( the direct or ) for sh ar ing with us such & n b s p ; great scene s behind the st age .
It is hard / un b e ar able & n b s p ; for me .
I mi s s the K ing of P op very much .
Yes ter day I saw the mo v i e `` H a ch i k o `` , about a f a m ous do g in J a p an , with my ch il d re n .
It is not the mo v i e it s el f that made me c ry , but the fact that we mi s s ed the first ten minute s , because M a m was mistake n about the time . ``
I made a mistake about the begin n ing time of the mo v i e .
D o n ' t worry .
I ' m a J a p an e se person who is study ing English .
I am interest ed in the f o o d s of for e i g n co un t ri es .
The reason I started study ing English is that I want to read a l ot of b l o g s about c ook ing .
I ' ll also try to in t ro d u ce J a p an e se f o o d to for e i g n people .
F or in st ance , re c i pe s for supper , dr in k s , sweet s , and so on .
To day , I went to a pe t sh op .
I b ough t a to y for my do g .

N e x t week , I will give the to y to m y do g .
I suppose he will be ha p p y .
The ly ri c s are of little us e for study ing J a p an e se .
I do not re c o m m en d listen ing to it too care ful ly .

I need you to c he er me up .
If I work tomorrow , the next day is a ho l i day !
I do n ' t have any p l an s yet but I have to go to the c ar de al er ( T O Y O T A ) to c he c k my c ar in the morning .
Even though my c ar is not a P ri us , I am still w or ri ed . . .
e ng l ish ra d i o every day , and I heard in the new s about the P ri us to day .
I went to a sp or t s sh op after work to day .
I tri ed to find s k i we ar .
It ' s sea s on off now , so everything > has become c he a p .
English is not my mother to n gue ( mother language ) .
I like this language but did n ' t have the en v ir on ment or friend / s to us e this language .
A n y way , this we b s ite is a good place to try to us e English and be f ri en d people from all over the world .
N ic e to me e t you guy s , and T h an k you my for read ing my first English di ar y ent ry .
I ' m writing a di ar y after a long time .

What country would you like to go to ?
because I have never been there .
I went to a un ive r s ity that is my first ch o ic e to day .
It was full of f un , and I found a way of le ar n ing English .
I do n ' t have enough time . . .
I like to study but I c a n ' t do it for a very long time .
P l us , I have to work on a P ow er P o in t present ation and a less on p l an .

well , now , I will write next time . . .
R e c ent ly , I have started run n ing to los e we i g h t .
When I was you ng er , I ra n every day to train .
So I thought I could still run hard .
But when I ra n , I felt a pai n in my left le g .
I think my we i g h t is too he a v y to run hard .
No w I run at a very s l ow p a ce or walk .
I think it is not good for my he al th to run s ud d en ly .
I ' m 2 1 year s old .
I am a st ud ent at H an s h in U n ive r s ity .
My un c le and family were very kind .
My s is ter and I were very j o y ful .
We went to the op er a house , water p ar k , and k an g ar o o p ar k .
It was a very ex it ing and sp e c i al ex pe ri ence .
On the last day , my a un t ga ve me some A ust r al i an ch o c o l ate , a k an g ar o o do ll , and a s u it .
My s is ter and I were so s ad .
My c ous in pro m is ed to me e t on the in ter ne t on C y w or l d and N ate On .
This is my first j o ur n al ent ry me m or y .
And good - by e ~ ~
The new b a ke ry c a f e sh op open ed in M in a m im or im a ch near a st ation .
I had l un ch at this sh op .

My a un t is a teacher .
S t r an g e ? ?
I me t up with some old friend s yesterday .
I have know n them for over 1 0 year s .
We dr an k al c o h o l and at e K or e an f o o d at the first re st a ur ant .
One friend said `` I want to eat ra m en . ``
I was surprise d because I was full .
But I me t him there after a while .
I wonder why J a p an e se people like to eat ra m en noodle s after they dr in k a l ot of al c o h o l .
I s this something only the J a p an e se do ? ?
I think it ' s a very interest ing place .
I always want to make friend s .
But I ' m too ti m id to talk with the for e i g n er s around me .
My ma j or is C h in e se .
E ver im a g in ed what it would be like if you were s w a ll ow ed by the g i g ant ic le g less re p t i le ?
The en i g m as clear up one by one , and by the end of the cha p ter , I found myself being able to understand the ex amp le co d e at the begin n ing .
This b ook does not begin with m un d an e stuff , such as ' if - else state ment s ' , ' us ing a l is t ' , ' for l o op s ' and the like .
A t first , it show s off more P y th on ic f e a ture s such as di ction ar ies , do c str ing s , l is t comp re h en s ion , and la m b d a f un ction s , which f as c in ate me .
This is my first di ar y ent ry , so I will like to in t ro d u ce myself .
My ho b b ies are sh op p ing , watch ing mo v i e , listen ing to m us ic s , girl s talk and sleep ing in my l o v ly be d .
I ' m the ha p p ies t when I do the se act i v it ies .
But I got bu s y because of the p re p ar ation for a co ll e g e ' s ex a m in ation , I can not do them .
No w , I ho pe to finish the ex a m in ation and ent er the co ll e g e of my first ch o ic e .
T h an k you for read ing my first di ar y ent ry .
I usual ly do n ' t enjoy read ing b ook s , but I ' m study ing English in C an ad a .
I should do what I can to im p ro ve my English .
H is so n has no friend s because he live s in a mi l it ar y are a with his family . He also does n ' t have a s is ter or brother .
He want s to make a friend , but it is n ' t easy .
He was very b or ed of play ing alone and de c id ed to go some place where his father said he should never go .
He got s c ar ed and ra n back home .
The next day he visit ed the c amp again .
He me t a bo y who looked about the same age as him .
They talk ed to each other and became friend s .
He not ic ed his friend did n ' t have enough f o o d , so he brought f o o d to him every day .
They talk ed a l ot about their own live s .
He visit ed his friend ' s house , the conc ent r ation c amp .
H it l er s so n was co l d because there was no he at ing .
So he told this friend that he want ed to home .
The next day , H it l er and his w if e not ic ed their so n did n ' t sleep in his be d last night .
They started w a il ing and the mo v i e finish ed .
That ' s what I re m e m b er about the mo v i e .
I w an n a me e t for e i g n er s * - *
I l o ve for e i g n er s so much .
B l on d e .
B l u e eyes .
that ` s why I ` m le ar n ing e ng l ish .
This is because I ' d l o ve to visit T A I W A N .
I have tri ed to study M and ar in when I was in j un i or high school .
C h in e se - character s are us ed in M and ar in and J a p an e se , so I thought M and ar in would be e as i er to study than other language s .
Some of mean ing of ch in e se - character s in M and ar in and J a p an e se are same but some of them are not .
it made me con f us ed .
A l th ough , M and ar in has four a c c ent s in one sound ( I c a n ' t explain about it clear ly in English , try to understand ! ) .
F or this reason , I stop p ed study ing M and ar in in a week .
It should be great man ! `` .
I ' m sure that K things are p op ul ar c ur r ent ly , but T a i w an has many things that appeal ; like it s c ul ture ( es pe c i ally for you ng people ) , f o o d and tra d i tion s .
So , how can I start to le ar n M and ar in again ?
The number of de ad or mi s s ing people is est im at ed to be more than 33 0 0 at present .
The di v is ion direct or of M i y a g i P re f e c t ur al P o l ic e say s there might be more than ten th ous and v ic t im s .
I had C h i j im i and fresh e g g ro ll s ( or s um m er ro ll s ) for dinner .
C h i j im i was too hot , because I put too much K im ch i in it , but fresh e g g ro ll s were good .
My you ng er d aught er help ed me ma k fresh e g g ro ll s .
We p re p ar ed let t us , a c u c um b er , be an sp ro ut s , ch ic k en , sh ri m p s and la b i ate for it .
She got the k n a c k of it in no time and she was good at w r a p p ing it after all .
They were beautiful .
I should ' ve take n picture s of them .
I walk ed to D a it a b ash i for about three hour s after I went to A z a b u with two people , and at e a me al in the H ar d R ock C a f e .
I want to speak English f l u ent ly and co m m un ic ate with any body all over the world .
I think I ' m very la z y about everything .
I of ten po st po ne va ri ous things that need to be done .
The le ng th of time people live is limit ed . So how much I can do in that time ?
When I think about this , I feel that I c a n ' t was te time at all .
She was f at but now she is s k in n y .
I am afraid to speak in English .
I had dinner with my friend s , and some of their friend s yesterday .
One of my friend s just came back from F r ance the day before yesterday . A no ther friend of mi ne is good with English , and their friend s are also good with English , so when I me t them , I was s ur r ound ed by English speak er s .
I can understand some of what they talk about , but it ' s hard to respon d .
But , I had a n ic e time because they were n ic e people .
How do I get better at speak ing English , es pe c i ally with A m er ic an s and E ur o pe an s ?
D o you have some me th o d s that you can provide me , because I think my English is poor : ( .
To day was a fine day .
I went by the T a m a ri ver for c y c ling .
I was re st ing by the ri ver side when some c at s a p p ro a ch ed me .
So I pe t ted the c at s .
H is less on s mo ve my heart .
I will try to write in English .
But No r th J a p an has been da m age d by the e ar th qu a ke .
We will do our be st .
I b ough t a new P C .
It was such an ex c it ing ex pe ri ence ! !
I a p p l i ed for a job as a re ce p tion is t in English school .
I found the job off er in an English free paper .
It ' s a part time job ,
I only have to work one day a week .
I ' m house w if e , so it ' s con ve n i ent for me to do such a short time job .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t have any reason s to study English so di l i g ent ly , but if I get a job which require s some pro f ic i en c y in English , I think I could im p ro ve my English .
A t the in ter v i e w ,
What ' s is your we a k point in your job
A re you able to a d j ust your work ing hour s for the students ' con ve n i ence ?
I was so up se t when I was asked that , because I had not p re p ar ed for the job in ter v i e w .
So I could n ' t p re ten d to be s m ar t at all , I mean , I just answered honest ly .
but people around me always tell me that they can feel at e a se after talk ing with me .
P ro b ably because I can listen to them very well that ' s why they can
feel re la x ed with me .
I ' m e age r to do something which I ' m interest ed in , but some time s I los e my mo t i v ation ra p id ly .
I ' m not go n n a go a b ro ad , I do n ' t have any p l an s to live a b ro ad . B e c a us e I ' m house w if e , it ' s difficult for me to go far away .
O f course , I can ar r an g e my time to s u it st ud ent ' s sit u ation .
I will keep every T h ur s day for your students .
T h o se were my answer s .
What would you think if you were the in ter v i e w er who own ed a co z y English school ?
To day he went to n ur se ry school .
When I was a ch il d , in our c ity L e g o was only so l d in a bo x with M il k y W a y . There were from ten to twenty ( de s i g n s ? ) , but from the se ( de s i g n s ) I con st r u c ted so many different things , it s c ar es me .
1 0 year s have pass ed but I still want to play with the con st r u c t or , because M in e c r a f t ent h r al led me more than W or l d of W ar c r a f t .
I feel like a kid which ga ve a mi ll ion de ta il s for L e g o .
E s s a y : D o you agree with ma k ing a s m o k ing are a ?
I ' m writing this es s a y to im p ro ve my a c ad e m ic writing ability .
Q u es tion : The un ive r s ity is consider ing ma k ing a s m o k ing are a ; D o you agree ?
I agree that ma k ing a s m o k ing are a is a good idea , re st ri c ting s m o k er s to s m o ke in a sp e c if ic l o c ation only .
In addition , pass ive s m o k ing has been said to have the most ne g at ive effect among all effect s of s m o k ing .
It is a p ity that many people are affect ed by the second - hand s m o ke , al th ough they do not s m o ke themselves and try to take care of their own bo d ies .
We started a new pro c ed ur e in 1 994 .
This pro c ed ur e is s up er i or to con ve n tion al b re a st - p re s er v ing s ur g er y .
To day my to p ic is about dance .
D o es every on e know much about dance ? ?
No w a day s da n c ing has l ot s of style s so we can tell the di f f er ence between `` old school `` and `` new school `` about da n c ing .
O l d school has many p op ul ar style s that you may have never heard before .
`` B re a k in `` , `` P op p in `` , `` L ock in `` and `` H i p - H op `` are old school dance s which became f a m ous in the 1 97 0 ' s - 1 9 8 0 ' s .
P op p in is my be st da n c ing style in which the mo ve ment s are so f re a k y .
I re c o m m en d you watch this dance if you are interest ed in it or you have never watch ed it .
N e w school dance became p op ul ar in the 1 99 0 ' s .
I do n ' t know about the se because the se style ' s history is not as de e p as old school , so I just know the conc ept of `` make your own mo ve s what ever you like `` .
If any body want s to know more about dance , commen t me please !
F in ally , than k s for read ing such a b or ing di ar y .
Then she j um p ed from the to i le t and started to run away like a d u c k with her di a p er around her an k le s .
It all ow s people to live de light ful live s .
There is a ho st of fact or s le ad ing to job sat is f a ction .
P ro v id ed that a person work ed in a no is y and c r amp ed room , he is less like ly to be sat is f i ed ; there f or e , a good en v ir on ment is require d .
The e m p l o y er s could e qu i p their office with so p h is t ic at ed f a c il it ies as much as they po s s i b ly can , in or d er to provide work er s co m f or t and con ve n i ence .
There is no need for the bo s s to look at his s ta f f over their should er s .
In addition , c or p or ation s can , every so of ten , or g an i z e some re c re ation al act i v it ies , which may let work er s feel a sen se of be l on g ing .
It is g en er ally accept ed that people want to be re c o g n i z ed for their work .
In such case , e m p l o y e es would feel ent h us i a st ic and mo t i v at ed without feel ing that their work is mo no t on ous .
When an in d i v id u al perform s ex ce p tion ally well in his work , the re w ar d s would in s p i re him to be more di l i g ent , and this , in turn , will be ne f it the comp an y .
A l th ough job sat is f a ction is very sign if ic ant , it is un re al is t ic to have all work er s feel sat is f i ed in their work .
However , me as ur es should be take n to a ch i e ve this go al , get ting as many people having job sat is f a ction as we po s s i b ly can .
The ex is ting p r a c t ic able and effect u al a ction s should be c ar ri ed out while new s te p s are take n into consider ation serious ly .
I write in my di ar y two time s to day .
I go to my job .
But , I ha te work ing .
I watch ed a mo v i e re c ent ly at a the at er .
I watch ed L o ve ly B on e .
It was an interest ing and
very s ad story .
I like d this mo v i e .
I think every on e should watch this mo v i e .
T h an k you for look ing my di ar y .
It s n ow ed on C h ri st m as E ve .
It was very ro man t ic , so many l o ver s went out on d ate s .
It felt more like V al ent in es ' D a y than C h ri st m as E ve in C h in a .
D o n ' t you think so ? What about in other co un t ri es ? D o es C h ri st m as E ve see m like V al ent in es ' D a y , too ?
Yes ter day , I watch ed some mo v ies at a the at er .
F or the first time in my life , I watch ed two mo v ies in one day .
I watch ed `` The R ite `` and `` K ing ' s speech `` .
My English teacher re c o m m ed `` K ing ' s speech `` , because I could le ar n B ri t ish English .
But , I prefer r ed the ex or c is t f il m .
I believe in a ng el s and the de v il .
I will go with you to the the at er ! ( M a y b e ? )
be s id e is a p re po s i tion , so it always go es before a no un or no un p h r a se
G en er ally it is called a p ic k led p l um e in English .
U M E B O S H I is one of the most p op ul ar tra d i tion al J a p an e se f o o d s in J a p an .

O f ten U M E B O S H I is put down in the c ent er of a bo x l un ch with only ri ce called H I N O M A R U - B E N T O ,
because it look s like the f la g of J a p an .
J a p an e se p amp as gra s s is a very p op ul ar p l ant in J a p an .
It is of ten see n in a ut um n .
J a p an e se p amp as gra s s was so p op ul ar that we could see it near ri ver s every where .
However , I think there is get ting to be less of it .
I s el d o m see it in Tokyo .
This is why I b ough t some .
But I am s ad that I must bu y p amp as gra s s to even see it .
I us ed to enjoy the nature and feel the cha ng ing sea s on s when I was a ch il d .
C h er ry b l o s s o m s in the sp r ing , s un f l ow er s in the s um m er , p an p as gra s s in the a ut um n , and so on .
No w I am wonder ing what I should display in the w in ter .
I ' ve not ic ed that in English re c i pe sit es , am o un t of f l o ur is me as ur ed in v o l um e ( c up s ) .
We put many f l ow er s , in c en se st ic k s and sweet treat s there , and then we p r a y ed for the pe a ce ful re po se of our ance st or s .
A fter p r a y ing , we at e the sweet treat s which were put on the gra ve .
E at ing them is believe d to keep one in good he al th by the ance st or s ' p ow er .
I want to stay in good he al th for ever .
I stay ed the night at my friend ' s house .
B e c a us e her family is C h ri st i an .
( My family is not C h ri st i an .
so at my house , it does n ' t re ally feel that we s ter n is ed . )
But it felt for e i g n at her house .
So the at m o s p he re at home change s because of the people who live in it .
I am going to gradua te from S e o ul N ation al U n ive r s ity of T e ch no l o g y this year .

I want to provide help for poor people .
I will visit an or p ha ng e , and take care of the a g ed .
T h ough it is very difficult to help them , I will try .

I want to find a for e i g n er because I want to speak on S k y pe .
If you ' re interest ed in J a p an or J a p an e se , please sen d me a me s s age !
I ar ri v ed at P er th on the 2 n d of A u g ust , 2 0 0 9 .
I went to an English school , S t M ar k ' s , for 4 month s .
I me t a l ot of friend s from va ri ous co un t ri es there : C h in a , No r th K or e a , T a i w an , B r a z il , In d i a , S w it z er l and , T ur ke y . . .
And even better , I me t a T a i w an e se girl f ri en d there !
No w a day s , almost all of my friend s have go ne back to their country , because their v is as had ex p ir ed .
I mi s s them , but I believe we can see each other again one day !
I went to M c D on al d ' s to day .
It is the most enjoy able and effect ive me th o d I ' ve en c o un ter ed - - after la ng - 8 , of course - - so far .
Ya h o o answer s is a s er v ic e that en able s you to as k and answer question s on s ever al as pe c t s of life .
You also can write about a pro ble m that has been p la g u ing you , so other s can help you with it and give you some a d v ic e .
You can p ic k a c ate g or y which re p re s ent s the ty pe of question that you want to as k or answer . Then , ty pe your question or look to see if some question s need answer s .
I ' m only interest ed in `` F a m i ly `` , which is a sub c ate g or y of F a m i ly & R el ation s h i p s .
I think read ing those pro ble m s in c re as es my con t ent ment with what I have .
S ud d en ly , all of one ' s own pro ble m s see m small er and more tri v i al comp ar ed to their pro ble m s .
So it ' s like this :
A n s w er s once da i ly - - - > 1 point
It ' s pretty te m p ting , right ?
There is also a le ve ling s y s te m .
This di ar y ent ry is an over v i e w of H an as a ku I ro ha E p . 6 ' s .
She is the you ng m aster ' s a c qu a in t ance .
She as s er ted that the hotel should re f or m it ' s s er v ic e .
To start , T a k a k o change d O h an a and N a k o ' s un if or m s .
But , the un if or m was very in d e c ent .
The hotel ' s call er s were very surprise d .
The re f or m was not good .
O h an a thought that O h an a and N a k o should put them on .
The idea was p le as ing to the hotel ' s call er s .
I take a co m m ut er train and the sub way to my office .
It take s about 4 0 minute s al t o g e ther .
I usual ly c a n ' t find a sea t to sit down .
It is a do or that when you open it , you can get into where ver you want without mo v ing .
It is from the J a p an e se an im ation `` D or a e m on `` .
There are too many people who want get a high gra d e on the T O E I C .
I ' m go n n a take the t est in S e o ul , which is a little b it far from my ga r ri s on .
It take s about one hour and thirty minute s by bu s .
So I ' ll go away for a week en d and take the T O E I C .
I ' ll also see my friend s , eat something de l ic i ous , and bu y some b ook s .
My b i o g r a p h y
gr e e ting s !
Let ' s not talk about s ad things , in g en er al my d aught er is already gr ow n up .
I was b or n in A l m at y , Ka z a k h st an , now I live in P or t l and , M a in e , U S A .
S in ce my ch il d h o o d I like d to draw , in kind er g ar ten the school girl s were stand ing in the qu e u e so I pai n ted them all do ll s , es pe c i ally do ll in a s w im s u it , and c l o th es that could be put on the se do ll s .
In school my not e b ook s back co ver was all draw ing s of face s in school te x t b ook s , all hu man person s were c or re c ted , because they seemed not n ic e enough to me , even gr and f a ther L en in was tra n s f or m ed into a n ic e ma ch o !
In w in ter , sit ting in a bu s , , the g la s s was pai n ted with eyes , l i p s , e t c . . .
and this . . .
and this is when my ar t is t ic care er end ed .
I almost every day , I dr e w out the p or t r a it s of mo v i e star s , re l at ive s and friend s .
No w I ' m with you here , now I ' m le ar n ing to pai n t living ma ter i al .
D ri v ing a c ar
I went to M t .
T a k a o in J a p an by c ar ; ) I dr o ve only for two hour s but I was very tired .
I want to go to other n ic e place by c ar .
How do you man age the c or re ction s you get on L an g - 8 ?
And I have got ten some c or re ction s .
I just read them and understand , but I c a n ' t re m e m b er my mistake s and c or re c t express ion s .
So I am consider ing ma k ing not es for this , so I can see my mistake s and I can re v i e w them .
I know some of my pro ble m s , but it is not easy to c or re c t them when I speak or write in English .
L e ar n ing a language is not easy .
It take s time , does n ' t it ?
D e c id ed to qu it my job .
I started to feel pai n in my back , so I de c id ed to as k my bo s s to re d u ce my work ing hour s .
When I asked him , he told me he need ed a person who can work from 6 to 2 without any b re a k s , and asked me whether I would like to c ar ry on or not .
I had to de c id e then and there .
I thought my he al th was more im p or t ant , and it was just a c as u al job .
A fter our con ver s ation , I told my co w or k er about what happen ed .
He was s ad .
M o v able T y pe H a c k - a - th on
I part ic i p at ed in the we b de ve l op er s even t last S at r u day .
It was called `` M o v able T y pe H a c k - a - th on `` , a de ve l op er s ' even t for b l o g g ing so f t w ar e called `` M o v able T y pe `` ( here a fter `` M T `` ) .
M T is f a m ous so f t w ar e for b l o g g ing , but now a day s it is f re qu ent ly us ed as C M S so f t w ar e in J a p an .
M T is also know n as the ri v al so f t w ar e of W or d P re s s .
I us e both , but now I ten d to us e M T for my job .
I de ve l op ed a work f l ow p l u g in .
The people who ga ther ed at the even t were re ally a w es ome de ve l op er s , and I would never be able to s ur p as s them in de ve l op ing - y es , they were re ally re ally great de ve l op er s .
I was invite d to the b ir th day part y .
A c t u ally , I me t her for the first time the other day .
I mo v ed in this v i ll age last a p ri l , so it is good for me to co m m un ic ate with new people .
It was very f un .
A fter we s an g , she pai d almost for everything .
I said I could pay but she re f us ed .
In J a p an , we ten d to treat the person who has a b ir th day .
It is a j a p an e se c ust o m .
But , in for e i g h country , the person who has a b ir th day treat gue st s ?
B y the way , my j a p an e se friend in F r ance had a dinner at his friend ' s T a i w an a is mar i age part y .
He propos ed all of gue st s ( 4 people ) to s up p or t for this co up le because it ' s a mar ri age part y .
E ver y on e pai d for this co up le but the 4 gue st s asked why they had to pay for the co up le .
This is because the co up le had p l an n ed it that way .
In a for e i g n country , is it not the c ust o m ?
I have to work at a part time job to day .
There are l ot s of n ation al it ies . ( p l ur al )
There are l ot s of different people from different co un t ri es e living in A u c k l and .
I like it here .
The reason why I like it here is because It is o k if I am e different from other s .
O ther thing that I like is that people are re ally re la x ed and say `` D o n ' t worry about it `` when I made a mistake .
We might have a mi s un d er st and ing between each other some time s because we came from different co un ri es and have different idea s .
But I want to try to understand the di f f er ence s as much as I can .
I never le ar n ed about the di f f er ence s when I was in J a p an .
This is a great op p or t un ity for me .
I am writing my di ar y for the first time .
I am a high school st ud ent , c ur r ent ly in the first gra d e , from J a p an .
I am going to visit A ust r al i a for my school ex c ur s ion next F e b r u ar y .
So , I want to im p ro ve my English s k i ll and know ( more about ) the A ust r al i an c ul ture .
S in ce ty p h o on tra ver s ed j a p an , it ' s get ting co o l so quick ly ! !
I feel that f a ll might not come to J a p an this year , which every body know s there are four clear ly se p ar at ed sea s on s .
A ccord ing to a story , when the new s c aster said that a ut um n would n ' t ar r ive
this year , a bo y who w ar b or n in O c t , in other w or d s b or n in a ut um n , w or ri ed that
his b ir th day would n ' t be ce le b r at ed .
What ch il d re n say and do , always am us es us .
When I go sh op p ing , most of my p ur ch as es are conc er n ing c l o th es .
Even though I ma j or in e c on o m y , one of my dr e a m s is to be
through a job in v o l v ing e c on o m ic or f in ance .
L a st , I would start a fashion bra n d called `` mi k i `` .
I just keep going for w ar d ! !
I always us e my i P o d to u ch , which is not l ate st mo d el but the so - called 2 0 0 9 ver s ion .
It ' s us e ful to c he c k my e m a il , t w it ter , the we a ther , the c a p it al mar ke t and so on .
B e c a us e it take s time to bo ot up my P C , I of ten us e my i P o d in s te ad , es pe c i ally in the morning .
But to day it has something wrong with it .
F or in st ance , it require s me to in p ut my pass w or d t w ic e to un l ock .
I re b o ot ed it but it ' s still ma l f un ction ing .
So now I ' m re st or ing it v i a i T un es .
M a y b e I need to set it up again but that would take time . s i g h .
N ic e to me e t you , every on e .
I am J a p an e se .
I am an office work er ,
and in my job there are op p or t un it ies to me e t for e i g n visit or s .
So I need English and I want to speak English .
I ' ll try and study .
I have been at No r th C ar o l in a for 2 month .
But un f or t un ate ly , my English s k i ll s still re m a in poor .
So , which one is more polite ? . The express ion is as be l ow :
C an I have the da ta ~ ~ ~ ?
I re ally wonder which one should I ch o o se .
A ty p h o on is coming to J a p an .
So it has been ra in ing in O s a k a for the past three days .
The ty p h o on come s to J a p an every J un e : (
My friend s in O k in a w a say w in d has been strong and there have been black o ut s
To m or r ow it will come to the Ka n s a i are a .
And the day after tomorrow it will go to the Ka n t o u and To u h o ku are as
M an y people in those are as / re g ion s still live in as y l um s .
S t ro ng w in d and ra in will make the gr ound of the mo un tain we a k .
I ho pe it w o n ' t let them s u f f er more : (
This te m p or ar y job end s at the end of this month .
It is un c o m f or t able to stay in an un f a m il i ar place .
The great est difficult y about being here is the f o o d .
I take good care of my comp le x ion by eat ing a l ot of ve g e t able s and re f r a in ing from bad f o o d .
So , I had my bo s s bu y some ve g e t able s for me .
A fter I receiv ed them last night , I kept them in the re f ri g er at or .
But this morning , I dis c o ver ed that they had f ro z en over night .
If a comp an y bu il d s a large fact or y near our co m m un ity , it will make job op p or t un it ies around the c ity .
However , it may cause a ir or water po ll u tion and no is e which come s from fact or y dis po s al .
L ook at C h in a , they are a ty p ical ex amp le .
F ir st ly , our co m m un ity will have to think about the a d v ant age s and dis ad v ant age s in a d v ance .
I think I will s up p or t the fact or y even though I w o n ' t work there .
It ' s because I ' m con ne c ted to them .
It help s make business re c o ver y .
O h to day ' s es s a y is c r a p .
I c a n ' t write this very well .
What do you as s o c i ate with when you are asked that question ?
I as s um e you think you are being asked for your ce ll p h on e number .
That was the p h r a se I us ed to as k c ust ome r s to ent er their P I N for their de b it c ar d s .
It is e m b ar r as s ing to say , I ' d never re c o g n i z ed this mistake .
One day a lady laugh ed after I said this .
I could n ' t catch her w or d s , and I wonder ed why she laugh ed , of course .
I asked my C an ad i an friend s for the reason .
They said , `` M a y b e she said , ' do you want my ce ll p h on e number ' ? ``
You r question is we ir d . ``
No w , in s te ad of that , I say `` C an you please ent er ( or put ) your number ? `` I am very afraid that there are no ther wrong sen t ence s I think are c or re c t .
Even if the sen t ence is gra m m at ic ally c or re c t , I may us e it in the wrong sit u ation .
But I would n ' t not ic e that I was us ing it in c or re c t ly .
That think ing make s me speak so f t ly .
I know it ' s not a good ha b it .
B y the way , `` could I have your sign a ture on this ? `` ( while point ing to the re ce i p t ) . This is c or re c t , is n ' t it ? ?
c er a m ic s c l u b .
He entered an or g an i z ation for my c l u b .
It ' s a very im p or t ant job , and he felt it was too hard to con t in u e .
There are more un re as on able s [ ? ? ? ] and con t r ad i ction s pe c ul i ar to J a p an than difficult y .
But , there are circumstance s at the or g an i z ation .
He was not sat is f i ed with that s y s te m .
He dis like d do ing the job s .
And he dis like d being in my c l u b .
But since he con t in u es to go to this c l u b , he must go do the job .
He left our c l u b .
I at ten d ed the i g o class to day .
But soon , one of the f r ance se came to tea ch us
because he had already le ar n ed i g o
so he told us some things about i g o .
A fter that , I think my i g o te ch n i qu e got a little better .
T h an k you very much
I found a sen t ence which end ed with `` than k you very much `` .
I asked my friend s what does the `` than k you very much `` mean , and they t aught me that it was just a saying .
I am going to A ust r al i a in a f e w days .
No w the J a p an e se go ver n ment is bu y ing a l ot of U S do ll ar s , and the ex change ra te change d .
I did n ' t want the J a p an e se go ver n ment to do such thing , or at least wait unti l after my tra ve l s .
My favor ite mo v i e is `` A P ER F E C T W O R L D `` .
B u ch is a c ri m in al who k il led some people .
He es c a p ed from the police .
F in ally , B u ch di ed because of a police man act ed by C l in t E a st w o o d .
I always c ry when I see the scene where B u ch and the kid se p ar ate .

We will be very gr ate ful if you can understand our reason .
I want to apologize about this pro ble m to you and to the other ne i g h b or s .
He will go to your house next S un day even ing .
I will be very gr ate ful if you can accept his a po l o g y .
A fter writing my last di ar y ent ry , more than 3 month s have pass ed .
It is a bad ha b it to give up what I ' ve started in a f e w days .
I try study ing pro g r a m ing and al g or i th m s , but they are too difficult for me to understand .
I respect the people who can us e them free ly .
In J a p an , it is 2 : 0 0 am .
I ' m re a ly w a ke ful and hung ry .
I ' m eat ing `` D O R A Y A K I `` .
It is de l ic i ous .
If you come to J a p an and eat it , you ' ll be ha p p y .
P le a se help me to de ve l op my English .
I need your help .
T h an k you !
I got on a night bu s for the first time .

study ing e ng l ish is hard for me , but I will con t in u e !
I wish that I could find a person who is le ar n ing ch in e se , so we can help each other !
B i g dis a p po in t ment by S um o . D is a p po in ted by s um o
I am not a S um o f an and do n ' t have a favor ite S um o w re st l er .
But , as a J a p an e se , I am very dis a p po in ted over the new s ma t ch f i x ing in S um o .
But S um o is not only part of our c ul ture but also a n ation al sp or t .
I do n ' t understand why they would sp o il their job s .
In this case , they will be give n the s a c k , but I am wonder ing how to re t ri e ve S um o w re st l er ' s sp or t s man s h i p as a pro f es s ion al play er and at t r a c t f an s again .
I ho pe they know how many people in the world are dis a p po in ted by this new s .
He re is one of my favor ite place s in the U K , The C ot s w o l d s .
I took the long way to the public f o ot p a th , to B a th . next to a old beautiful c ity with R o man bath .
A ll English people who I me t while on the p a th said ' He ll o ! ' .
A l m o st all English people are re ally friend ly !
I ' m try ing to listen to do u ble sp e ed English po d c a st s to make my e ar s get us ed to he ar ing English .
So I want to sub s c ri b e to many interest ing English po d c a st s .
D o you know any us e ful ke y w or d s to find English po d c a st s on i T un es ?
W ow , it ' s O c t o b er N O W !
I feel like it was just A u g ust .
S ept e m b er was just start ing .
T h ough I was in my house the who le day .
I s it the same in your country ?
D o you w r a p a b and an a around your ne c k when you have a so re th ro at .
I wonder if I have a f ever now or not .
I ' m ex ha ust ed because I went to O s a k a again to day to take another pai n ting class .
I or d er ed some ar t b ook s of I m ar i pai n ting for my pai n ting teacher .
I am ex cited that I will be able to us e some of the pretty de s i g n s from the b ook s .
I re ally would l o ve to im p ro ve my pai n ting s k i ll s .
So , I have to p r a c t ic e more !
I st ud i ed about qu al ity con t ro l for my t est .
Q C is very interest ing !
It is a s y s te m to make fine good s e c on o m ic ally f e as i ble for the bu y er .
I think the con s um er always require s fine good s , but the man u f a c ture r want s to make good s at a l ow co st .
The re l ation s h i p be t w en them never change s .
What does it take to ful f i ll the con s um er ?
In the morning I so le m n ly s w e ar that I will go to sleep at 1 0 p m , at 1 1 at the l ate st .
If I sleep 4 - 5 hour s at night d ur ing the who le week I will have to want to go to sleep in the even ing , w o n ' t I ?
And then morning come s and `` Some body , k i ll me ! ``
what is the di f f er ence between `` you know `` and `` you know what ``
She know s , how I ha te it when the people with who m I ' m in close co m m un ic ation act like this ! !
She ' s not my friend , I just do n ' t know the w or d in English which I may us e in this sit u ation . .
We are n ' t friend s and I was half - tru st ing her ti ll the se days , but now . . .
I know ex a c t ly that I do n ' t want to be almost - friend s ( may b e , fellows ? ) with her
To day ' s high was 3 5 de g re es in O s a k a . ( short er and natural )
We have to s a ve e le c t ri c ity because n u c le ar p ow er p l ant s are n ' t run n ing d u e to the a c c id ent at F u ku s h im a .
So we us e the a ir - condition er as little as possible .
I am w or ri ed that old people and ch il d re n will di e of he at str o ke .
I heard that 4 people di ed of he at str o ke in J a p an to day . . .
I went to K in k i U n ive r s ity and co m m un ic at ed with people who be l on g ed to other un ive r s it ies .
Yes ter day ' s even t was a `` de b ate ``
We de b at ed `` S h o ul d the J a p an e se go ver n ment raise the con s um p tion tax , or not `` .
I was on the side that had to ar gue that the J a p an e se go ver n ment should n ' t raise the con s um p tion tax .
I could re f ut e the ri v al ' s ar g u ment , but could n ' t ar gue l o g ic ally .
I ' m neither us ed to speak ing in public no r speak ing in English .
In the end I w on the de b ate , but I made some mistake s . .
I have to p r a c t ic e hard er
He re in J a p an , the only an n u al even t s with a family re un ion are sh o g at s u ( same as N e w Y e ar ' s D a y ) and o b on ( which is he l d in the middle of A u g ust ) .
S h ock ing ly , the room that I us ed to us e became my father ' s ho b b y room , so I s l ept in the gue st room but that was not so un c o m f or t able .
It was so great and there was too much to eat .
`` S a p po ro S n ow F est i v al `` is one of big and f a m ous w in ter even t s in J a p an .
S a p po ro is in H o k k a id o P re f e c ture in the no r th of J a p an .
I have never been ther e .
The first ent ry
It is V al ent in e ' s D a y soon .
I made some ch o c o l ate to day .
The reason I made it s light ly e ar ly is because I will go to Tokyo from the 1 4 th .
But I had to ta s te it .
B e c a us e I ' ve eat en ch o c o l ate now , I feel sick .
to study and I am give n ch o c o l ate , what should I do ?
If I say that I dis like it is it not r ud e ?
My d aught er has a r ash because she to u ch ed some in se c t s on the gra s s .
No w I can enjoy the s n ow y scene ry .
I ha te the co l d , but I like the s n ow y scene ry ! ! < 3
If your answer is `` Y E S `` , may b e you ' ll like to view my town ! ! * ^ ^ *
I do n ' t think it ' s a mo v i e for ch il d re n !
It ' s a good mo v i e and I like it
but I want ed to watch a ha p p y mo v i e to day .
I want to make friend s from all over the world .
because I ' m not that good at English but I ' m work ing on it .
I believe I will be a good English speak er some day .
My friend had an i P h on e and I en v i ed her .
I do n ' t know how to us e it very well yet .
I called and sen t e m a il s to my friend s .
P le a se tell me if you have your any a p p l ic ation s that you re c o m m en d .
A fter class es , I will have a meeting with students .
I ' ve never see n it before though , because I ' m not interest ed in A n im e .
P ic ture 2 : A girl co s p la y ing in front of G un d a m C a f e .
She is c ut e , is n ' t she ?
O f course I ' m interest ed in her .
( The man re f le c ted in the w in d ow is me .
I was st u c k in a tra f f ic j a m on the way home from work .
I would n ' t re c o m m en d that comp le te ly s il ly mo v i e , but , to be honest , I like d it .
It ' s about the office I work at .
I like to watch c ar t o on s and some time I to like watch J a p an e se c ar t o on with my you ng er brother .
F ir st time I did n ' t want see c ar t o on s because I did n ' t know anything about F un n y c ar t o on or mo v ies .
I can draw c ar t o on her o s .
So c ar t o on ar t is t s work hard , out of every c ar t o on I l o ve To m and j er ry
I had such a good time in Tokyo , that I am very tired .

Yes ter day , I started tak ing a J a p an e se teacher ' s class .

I do n ' t like ra in y days , so I was ha p p y to day .
What is the we a ther like in your country now ?
The c ity was l ock ed up . ( No th ing got in , and nothing got out ) .
It ' s an im p or t ant pro f es s ion al c y c ling ra ce .
As I never work on We d ne s day s , I could at ten d the run n ing ra ce .
I am le ar n ing English , because English is a g l o b al language .
I think that I can le ar n this language . W i ll you help me with this ?
if you could change one moment in your past , what would you ch o o se ?
In my case , I would go back to 2 0 0 5 .
A t that time , I was in C h in a to study C h in e se .
I had l ot s of op p or t un it ies to have some f un and make friend s . However , I did not re al i z e at that time how p re c i ous an op p or t un ity I had .
The `` G r and P ri x of J a p an `` of M ot o G P is la ter this week .
I re n ted a room at an In d i an ' s house , and there is an In d on es i an ma id .
She is in trouble now because the l and l or d has n ' t all ow ed her to con ta c t her family in In d on es i a since she came here .
I do n ' t understand the ' ma id s y s te m ' ( I think honest ly that hi r ing ma id it s el f is against the hu man right even if both agree d ) .
It ' s quite ri d ic ul ous to pro h i b it her to call , ma il and to have a mo b i le p h on e even though I have no idea about the In d i an way of think ing or their co m m on sen se ( or this is not about In d i an but just my l and l or d as an in d i v id u al ) .
I can let her us e my p h on e or P C , but is it good or bad ?
I do n ' t understand why it is a pro ble m to let her con ta c t her family .
Besides my l and l or d c a n ' t speak English at all and I c a n ' t speak T a m il either .
I do n ' t want to invite any un ne ce s s ar y trouble , but should I do something for her ? ?
There are many kind s of J a p an e se tea , such as gr e en tea , ma t ch a , H o j ic ha , co ar se tea and so on .

The reason for study ing English
I have been study ing English for 6 month s .
I want to get a s c or e of 6 . 0 on the I E L T S .
My writing s c or e is 4 . 5 , so I have to study more .
If I got a ( s c or e of ) 6 . 0 , I could go to the O E T p re p ar ation school in S y d ne y .
I want to know how I could write an English es s a y f l u ent ly .
M or e o ver , the more one le ar n s the e as i er one find s it to a c qu i re good le ar n ing s k i ll s .
And the more one p r a c t ic es one ' s le ar n ing style the quick er the le ar n ing pro ce s s become s .
P er s on ally , I have been le ar n ing English since e ar ly ch il d h o o d .
In those days , all I want ed was just to know a f e w w or d s so that I could say just a f e w sen t ence s in class .
My pass ion for read ing first came from the se b ook s : `` T h re e M en in a B o at , `` `` The G o d f a ther , `` `` G re at G at s b y , `` `` How to S te al a M i ll ion , `` and ' ' S n ow W h ite and the S e ve n D w ar f s . ``
M an y year s have pass ed since then .
I am still le ar n ing English .
No w that I am an a d ul t and know what my le ar n ing style act u ally is , I can now le ar n more at a give n time .
H aving been mo t i v at ed in high school I think I can hard ly stop le ar n ing now as I believe there is no end to m aster ing English .
T h an k s for your help to im p ro ve this pass age .
The man , however , s u ed his ex - girl f ri en d and f il ed a claim for all the g if t s he had give n her , which includ ed 5 pack s of d um p ling s , a bu g z a p p er , b ir th day c a ke s , S P A far e , high - sp e ed train ti c ke t s , and v it a m in s .
Besides that , he also asked for me d ical fee s and ment al comp en s ation am m o un ting to $ 1 0 0 0 0 ( U S ) .
The j ud g e r ul ed that the man went over b o ar d and that the g if t claim s were without me ri t , so he de n i ed the mo tion .
If I had re claim ed all the g if t s I sen t to the girl I had a c r us h on , I would have an i P h on e 4 p l us P S 3 now .
No t only did they c ut their ti es , but they also tri ed to re t al i ate against each other .
There ' s nothing more pe t ty than that !
I had been work ing for an A m er ic an comp an y for 4 year s before I took a ma ter n ity leave .
No w I ' m a home m a k er and conc ent r at ing / f o c us ing on ra is ing my d aught er in a to t ally do m est ic en v ir on ment ( which is pretty f un ) , but as the days go by my English s k i ll s have o b v i ous ly been de c l in ing . . .
Why do people s te p on me ?
Why are the other str a w s so close to me ?
Why do the we a ther and w in d hu r t me ?
It is pai n ful . I ha te everything .
One str a w close to me asked me why I ' m so un ha p p y .
I said , `` Why is the world so u g ly ?
I would n ' t have done this a f e w month s a g o , because b as ke t b a ll was my life .
O f course , I still l o ve play ing b as ke t b a ll , but I do n ' t feel that it ' s the most im p or t ant thing in my life .
Well , just now , I ' d like to have some re st .
B y the way , unti l yesterday , I have never take n the T O E I C ex a m .
I was n ' t sure how many people would be there , or how difficult the act u al ex a m was , I had take n the p re - t est before though .
In fact , it was difficult for me , but I seemed to enjoy the difficult y .
I heard that our d aught er was s c ar ed at first , but once she g l im p se their perform ance , she became interest ed in it .
A l th ough I have n ' t had a ch ance to talk to her since then , I can im a g in e what she would say .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to talk ing to her .
I ' m going by bu s .
But at the moment I tri ed to bu y some f r u it and ve g e t able s , I found my b a g had go ne .
That was the second time I ' d done this .
I have to be care ful not to do it for the th ir d time .
I have de c id ed to write in English .
I will be transfer ing from my un ive r s ity to another un ive r s ity .
I am not sure I can make full us e of my v o c a b ul ar y with sen t ence s .
I think I should try writing something .
The n u ance s are so difficult .
J a p an e se is e as i er than English .
Yes ter day , I le ar n ed about C + + at my un ive r s ity .
It is too difficult for me .
I near ly could n ' t return home yesterday .
I stay ed in a le c ture room from morning ' ti ll night .
It was a night m ar e .
We me t and we went to have l un ch at the S y d ne y C ent r al P la z a .
A fter we finish ed l un ch we at e ic e c re a m .
We ar ri v ed the co le s ( ? ) and we b ough t a ( bo t t le of so f t dr in k ) ( so d a ) .
We watch ed the mo v i e ' The To y S t or y 3 ' while eat ing some s n a c k s .
A fter the mo v i e end we took a n a p for a while and talk ed to each other about my conc er n s .
My girl f ri en d has been w or ri ed about me because she may l o ve me .
I de c id ed to go back to K or e a soon .
I should have le ar n ed English and about A ust r al i a .
If I had good English s k i ll I could get a job .
I will im p ro ve my English s k i ll .
I want ed to see my girl f ri en d , so I called her and we hung out for a while . A t that time one of my f la tm ate s came home with some s us h i ro ll s and we f l ock ed to the t able and star ed to eat them .
As soon as we finish ed eat ing , my girl f ri en d and I left the living room and str e t ch ed to g e ther .
We are get ting b or ed and tired so we going to go to be d at 1 O ' clock .
On face b ook , I made a new friend to day .
P le a se tea ch me it s mean ing !
I am surprise d to have receiv ed so many things free of charge .
I ' m going to make 2 j o ur n al s this week en d to make up for having b ro k en my pro m is e that I ' m going to keep a di ar y every day .
because my friend has come out of the ho p s it al .
My question s which I c a n ' t as k people now because I have not us ed English for a long time .
I ' ve never thought how poor my English is .
It was great s um m er va c ation for me .
A fter a 2 - week va c ation in Tokyo I came back to my a p ar t ment in A m er ic a .
A J a p an e se woman who live s in the room just be l ow mi ne , came up st a ir s to gr e e t me .
W o man ; `` We l c ome back ! ``
I have good new s and bad new s for you !
M o m o k o : `` Well , let me he ar the good new s first . ``
And what ' s the bad new s . . . ?
W o man : `` It ' s a long , my s ter i ous story . . . ``
W o man : While you were away , I not ic ed a pe c ul i ar sound in the k it ch en d ur ing the night .
M o m o k o : A P o l ter g e is t !
`` One night I heard the sound in the c a b in e t under the s in k . ``
I put my e ar to the do or of the c a b in e t and listen ed .
It sound ed like something was s c r at ch ing a b a g con tain ing ri ce .
W o man : `` No ! ``
`` I bang ed on the c a b in e t do or , ho p ing that the s c r at ch ing sound would stop . . . ``
`` and it stop p ed . ``
W o man : `` Yes , and . . . ``
`` There were a f e w s c r at ch es and b ite s on the th ic k paper b a g of ri ce . ``
I show ed the b a g to the l and l or d and . . .
W o man ; `` He hand ed me this . . . ``
What should I do if a ra t - mistake n ly eat ing the po is on and s u f f er ing - j um p s from the k it ch en c a b in e t ?
What should I do if I find a de ad ra t in the c a b in e t ?
I ' m going to re p la ce my da i ly j o ur n al to p ic , `` In ter ne t s la ng in J a p an `` , for `` K in d police office r s `` to day .
They did an in qu ir y both at the police office and un ive r s ity .
I ( re ally ) want ed to ri d e in a p at ro l c ar !
I do n ' t like ra in , because . . .
I c a n ' t we ar n ic e c l o th es and sh o es and because my ha ir get s we t .
A l th ough , I know of a good point .
I have an ex c us e not to go to the g y m because of the ra in ; )
H a ve a great day with a smile , every on e !
To day is the day that J a p an e se people s u f f er ed from the N u c le ar we a p on that was d ropped in H i ro s h im a 6 5 year s a g o .
The ce re m on y about mo ur n ing the people who di ed from this bo m b has been he l d every year ; this year it is even more his t or ical because the re p re s ent at ive s from we s ter n co un t or ies part ic i p at ed in the ce re m on y , es pe c i a ly the United States .
This change was d u e to the speech that was give n by P re s id ent O b a m a in B er l in .
What I was most impress ed by , was that the S e c re ta ry G en er al M r .
B an K i - mo on read a sp e a ch , speak ing strong ly , about how it is ne ce s s ar y to have a strong will to a ch i e ve world pe a ce without N u c le ar we a p on s .
I think he may have some mi x ed feel ing s because many of the J a p an e se show ed c r u el be ha v i or to w ar d s the people in the K or e an P en in s ul a ; he might be b la m ed by some K or e an s who do n ' t like the J a p an e se .
He visit ed and made some speech es in J a p an over those feel ing s .
W h i ch way is better to ti p : wait er or wait re s s ?
I ' m not sure how to ti p at a re st a ur ant because I ' ve just mo v ed to A m er ic a and my mother country J a p an does n ' t have such a c ust o m .
? W h i ch way do you think is most a p p ro p ri ate ?
1 : I would pay the b i ll and ti p in c ash .
2 : I would pay the b i ll in de b it and ti p in c ash .
3 : I would pay the b i ll and ti p in de b it .
I could always do this in 1 or 2 way s .
If I do 3 , should I write an am o un t of the ti p down in the b i ll ?
I would be ha p p y if you c or re c t my English comp o s i tion . U se your n at ive express ion : - )
I wish I could be as s m ar t as the g en i us , A l b er t E in s te in .
I have return ed to my home t ow n from H i ro s h im a to day by a ir p la ne .
W as it a near - mi s s ?
I was very surprise d at that .
H a ve you had the same ex pe ri ence ?
So on I will take an English ex a m .

You can le ar n j a p an e se .
please sen d a me s s age .
To be honest , my English is poor .
D o n ' t laugh at me , please .
The se days I have l ow spirit s .
She say s I always go out to sp en d time with my bo y f ri en d every day .
But the fact is I do n ' t go out every day .
The co ll e g e entrance ex a m in ation are over and we need to be re la x ing .
I gradua ted from my j un i or co ll e g e on 1 5 th M ar ch .
I went to j un i or co ll e g e . So my school life was for 2 year s .
I felt the time pass by very f a st .
If possible , I want to go there again !
S in ce I ' m in j un i or high school .
H i , It ' s me , er in .
So I have no f ur n i ture .
To day I went to S ant a M on ic a to bu y a so f a .
I b ough t a so f a made from b r ow n le a ther .
R e c ent ly , there is something I think about
Why do people of ten say . bad things ?
I do n ' t think they not ic e the w or d s they say will hu r t some on e im p or t ant some time .
They do n ' t know how much it hu r t s some on e .
I do n ' t want to say any w or d s which I do n ' t want to he ar from any on e .
E ver y on e need s to be kind and should take care of every on e around them
R e c ent ly , when I talk to by my bo s s she always say s some w or d s which make me s ad and n er v ous
L i ke , `` you are already too old , take care not to catch a co l d `` `` I do n ' t have any idea why you can not get a bo y f ri en d `` `` o h you ' ve got some we i g h t ! !
Even though She is 9 year s old er than me , she also does n ' t have a bo y f ri en d , She has more we i g h t than me , and She say s that just in front of our c ust ome r ! !
I am keep ing my p at i ence all the time but I feel so tired d ur ing work .
I came back to my house tired , my mother said something bad to me also .
H I ! E ver y E ng l s h English teacher !
My name is Say a ,
I ' m a U n ive r s ity st ud ent of F u ku o k a , J a p an .
My ma j or is English , but I ' m not good at English . I want to study E ng l s h English more .
I ' m ha p p y to be c o e m e become a me m b er of L an g - 8 .
( S u g g es tion : ) H a ve you ever tri ed it ?
If you have not , then I want to re c o m m en d that you do so .
You w o n ' t be dis a p po in ted .
It ' s a very n ic e de v ic e to study English !
I re c o m m en d you to bu y a K in d le to enjoy read ing .
I was so ex cited that I did not c he c k the s i z es and I end ed up bu y ing 3 different s i z es .
This morning , I pai n ted In u k ash i , a character from the no ve l N O . 6 .
My friend p h on ed me to k i ll time . [ more natural ]
I some time s dis like her because she s c o l d s me for not follow ing what she say s .
A l s o , I can only s a ve a very small am o un t of e le c t ri c ity , so I feel help less ness .
It ' s very t ough for me to think about anything in such m u g g y we a ther . . .
It is da ng er ous to in ve st all of your money at once . There f or e , I di v id e my money up and in ve st a small am o un t in each c ur re n c y .
Yes ter day was S un day .
I have not made a `` N e w Y e ar ` s c ar d `` yet .
I want to sen d one to my friend .
N e x t year ` s s y m b o l an im al is the ra b b it .
I dr e w a ra b b it on the c ar d .
I have po st ed the voice j o ur n al to see if my English is understand able .
P le a se try to start this v id e o and listen to it without the tra n s c ri p tion .
I have de c id ed to po st voice j o ur n al s here , because there are only so many op p or t un it ies to speak English in my every day life .
Some time s , I talk to one of those friend s on the in ter ne t , but he st ud ies J a p an e se hard so I always end up speak ing in J a p an e se when we talk .
I have po st ed some English v id e o b l o g s on You T u b e in the past .
But , I could not po st a l ot , because I could n ' t think of anything to talk about all the time .
But , L an g - 8 is different from You T u b e , because people can c or re c t my English .
I a p p re c i ate every on e ' s c or re ction s so far , and than k you for listen ing to this j o ur n al .
I went to the sh op p ing ma ll because my d aught er want ed to go .
D r um s made a me r ry r h y th m , and the who le st or e was in a new year s mo o d .
My d aught er ho p ed to bu y one .
A `` l u c k y b a g `` is a gra b b a g ( a b a g of un k n ow n ar t ic le s ) .
We c a n ' t ch o o se them , so I did n ' t want to bu y one .
I b ough t s ock s and got on a F er ri s w he el .
She had been s u f f er ing from s light st o m a ch a ch es for a f e w month s .
Let ' s wait and see . ' But things did n ' t change at all .
A fter she had an X - ra y , they found the cause of the st o m a ch a ch es .
( S or ry this is not a beautiful story ! ) They p re s c ri b ed some me d ic in e for her , and things have been get ting better .
This is just an as id e :
I ' m now p re p ar ing for the entrance ex a m of a gradua te school .
B y the end of this J un e , I will be work ing as a b an k er .
But I change my mind and de c id ed to ent er a gradua te course .
I do n ' t want to re g re t about my de c is ion .
But I ' m w or ri ed about whether I can get a new job after I ' ll leave there .
It ' s because new you ng gradua te s are most like ly to have more ch ance s to get hi r ed by J a p an e se comp an ies .
A long time a g o , when I was le ar n ing to s w im in the s w im m ing po o l ,
S in ce I was a very you ng ch il d , I us ed to s w im in the sha ll ow la ne .
U ne x pe c ted ly , I f e ll into the de e p la ne that was us ed only by a d ul t s .
I str u g g led to get out of the de e p water and I even t u ally es c a p ed the water .
But I had almost dr ow n ed ,
I have been s c ar ed of de e p water , s w im m ing , and po o l s since then .
But re c ent ly , I have been le ar n ing to s w im in the s w im m ing po o l again .
If every body cha ll e ng es against their f e ar s , they can over c ome their f e ar s .
I do n ' t know who will read this , but I ' ll keep up d at ing it as of ten as possible .
I ' m work ing the night sh if t and watch ing the O ly m p ic s right now .
I ' ve been watch ing it on T V con st ant ly since It started .
I did n ' t think it ' d for ce me to stay up this l ate at first , because there is only a 1 h o ur time di f f er ence between C h in a and J a p an .
O ur house is 9 5 0 square feet , so it is a small c ut e w h ite house .
Yes ter day , 2 co up le s came over and saw our house , and we got some respon se s but we did n ' t get off er yet .
To m or r ow some on e is coming here , also we are going to having a open house on this S un day .
I ho pe we can get a good off er soon .
I ' ve been a little a b it tired l ate ly .
This is my first time writing .
In the future , I want to write about my impress ion s of watch ing an im e .
D o you have a favor ite s ing er ?
I ' m interest ed in r ock m us ic now .
A c t u ally I have n ' t been able to sleep well l ate ly ( I do n ' t know why . . .
may b e it ' s because of the world c up ? ? ) , any way I stay ed up unti l after mi d night .
It ' s kind of an no y ing , and of course I co un ted she e p but it did n ' t work .
So I just turn d on a f an and took the time to re la x . . .
then , in the next moment , I was w o k en up by s un s h in e .
I re al i z ed it was 1 0 a m and I would be l ate .
In J a p an , after having gradua ted from co ll e g e , most of J a p an e se students work im m ed i ate ly and con t in u es to stay with in the comp an y for at least 3 to 5 year s .
Even t u ally most re c ent gradua te s w in d up stay ing there for a co up le of year s even if they have los t the interest of work ing in that comp an y .
In fact , I had work ed there for s ever al year s , and I hard ly saw people who work ed for more than 2 year s .
I had about 2 0 s ta f f ( sub or d in ate s ? ) ( C o - work er s ) under my position .
But only 1 or 2 people had re m a in ed work ing for 2 year s in the comp an y , while the re st left with in 1 year .
To day , I did a work out with my friend
and then I watch ed the S up er B ow l b a ll ! !
A t that time , I stay ed with my friend , her bo y f ri en d , and her bo y f ri en d ' s friend s .
I could n ' t speak with every on e but I think it was re ally good ex pe ri ence for me .
I w an n a do my be st before going back to J a p an !
To day , my class m ate ga ve me p l um s from his y ar d .
He is tri ling u al .
He asked me that why I had n ' t at ten d ed class last We d ne s day .
He asked If I d ar ed to eat f at me at .
My answer was `` Y U P `` and then he dr o ve me to a V i e t n ame se gr o ce ry .
While I took a look around in the V i e t an m e se mo m - and - p op st or e , he pe t ted my should er and said , `` He re you go , a V i e t n ame se s and w i ch . ``
A t re ce s s to day , he still p ul led me to the corner again and asked me if I want ed the p l um s and ve g e t able s .
He know s that I usual ly c ook ed on my own to s a ve money .
A t that mo n ent , I almost b ur st into tea r s .
It is sure that my T O E I C s c or e is very l ow .
However I like to watch some English mo v ies and talk to English m en ,
What should I do to im p ro ve my English s k i ll s ?
And I read some b ook s in English every day .
I know I need to make an effort .
R e c ent ly , a J a p an e se comp an y declar ed that the off ic i al language is English .
They should us e English in every sit u ation .
If I am in the e m p l o y e e of this comp an y , should I hand in my resign ation ?
This ( pass age / paragraph ) explain s my me d ical work .
We se le c ted pro st ate can c er s amp le s from ra d ical pro st ate c t o m y because , between 1 997 and 2 0 0 4 , 4 8 . 5 % ( 99 / 2 0 5 ) of s ur g er ies at our ho s p it al were perform ed follow ing ne o - a j u v ant ho r m on al the r a p y .
R e c ent ly , M o st s ur g er ies are perform ed without ne o - a j u v ant ho r m on al the r a p y at our ho s p it al .
There f or e , the an a ly se s of s amp le s from ra d ical pro st ate c t o m y without ne o - a j u v ant ho r m on al the r a p y are c ur r ent ly on g o ing .
It took 9 0 minute s .
It was a b it hard but I enjoy ed it .
I think I have good b al ance because I s ur f ing some time s .
We were very s w e at y ! !
I l o ve to s w e at while do ing sp or t s .
To night I saw the f il m ver s ion of `` The P h ant o m of O p er a `` at home , which play ed on T V for almost three hour s ! ! !
But it s m us ic is re ally f ant a st ic . The voice of the le ad ing act re s s de e p ly appeal ed to me .
The beautiful voice s in the mo v i e impress ed me a l ot . L i ke a ha un ting me l o d y in my mind .
I was tru ly to u ch ed by this sen t i ment al mo v i e , es pe c i ally when the p h ant o m let C h ri st in e and R a o ul go , I could n ' t help but she d my tea r s .
I sympath i z e with the p h ant o m a l ot though he is some time s too c r u el . But I think it ' s his so c i e ty that made him c r a z y .
How l on e ly he was ! ! !
It ' s a p ity that he could n ' t b r ing his t al ent into full play .
He was a g en i us !
Well , since I will go to N Y this s um m er va c ation , I expect to go to B ro ad way to watch this show live .
I got a new one .
To night , I am pai n ting .
I ' ve already done my job .
I was re ally ex cited , because I had no idea how I could I get a new idea for an ar t pro j e c t .
But now , I am pai n ting my new ar t work .
I am think ing about sp a ce .
This sp a ce is full of p ow er , because every on e can see it but , other s not just us can see it .
What should I write to in t ro d u ce my co m m un ity ?
B y the way , I b ro ke a str ing ( ? ? ) : (
I have to re p la ce the str ing .
I sign ed up yesterday , and this is my first di ar y .
I am so glad I found this we b s ite to le ar n e ng l ish on .
He he , I wish I could make more friend s around the world .
M o st of my family ' s g en er ation s have only one ch il d .
I am a G e m in i , and my b l o o d ty pe is B .
However , now I need to us e my e ng l ish for my business , so I do ex er c is es to im p ro ve it every day .
T h an k s a l ot !
The P h i ll ies W on !
A t first , I did n ' t want to watch the game because I want ed to / had to study .
The P h i ll ies led most of the game , so I was n ' t very w or ri ed and strong ly believe d they would w on .
However , by the e i g h th in n ing , the sit u ation change d .
I found out the R ock ies led .
In the n in th in n ing , R y an How ar d s c or ed a two run hi t and the s c or e 4 - 4 .
The s c or e even t u ally turn ed to 5 - 4 in the to p of the n in th .
I c a n ' t take my eyes off the po st se as on .
H a ll ow e en part y
Yes ter day , I went to a H a ll ow e en part y in school .
I thought one thing : how different it is b it w e en J a p an e se people and other s .
When I went to the part y , every on e made themselves up and w or e co st um es such as D r a c ul a , Z o m b ies , and V amp ir es .
It was so funny and am a z ing because I ' ve never see n a part y like this when I stay ed in J a p an .
Then , we dance d in a room .
But , most of the J a p an e se people did n ' t .
I know why . No r m a ly we do n ' t have this op p or t un ity to do this kind of da n c ing in J a p an .
One more reason is our person al ity . G en er ally , J a p an e se people are sh y , quiet and un c on f id ent . This is only my op in i p n .
We are es pe c i ally un c on f id ent , p es s im is t ic and ne g at ive people .
I think this is one of our person a ity pro ble m s and it ' s because we are afraid of f a il ur e .
A c t u ally , it depend s on the person .
I mean , J a p an e se people need to have more con f id ence and co ur age .
I believe that this will be interest ing for some on e who is le an ing J a p an e se because I will be comp ar ing life in the U S with that in J a p an .
E ver y p rofessor s ' ma in p ri or ity e y is to im p ro ve the qu al ity of their class es .
On the other hand , J a p an e se un ive r s it ies provide more op p or t un it ies for re se ar ch .
This di f f er ence cause s by the way to e v al u ate un ive r s ity . ( ? ? )
The se ra n k ing s are consider ed to be very im p or t ant .
In turn , there is less ra n k ing among un ive r s it ies in J a p an .
I f in ally re al i z ed that work ing as a day la b or er does n ' t s u it me .
If I work little by little after school week day s , I can co pe with study ing and having a part time job .
Even though I ' ve work ed as a day la b or er for two year s , I ' m through with do ing it !
( I ' ve just not ic ed this ent ry is full of ne g at i v ity .
I ' m sorry if this ent ry make s you feel un p le as ant . )
My f a v o ur ite f o o d s are ic e c re a m , p ud d ing , ch o c o l ate , c a ke , y o g ur t , s ash im i , s us h i , t empura , gra t in , and so on .
To day I change d my ha ir co l or because my b r ow n ha ir was so bad and my ha ir was so da m age d : ( I de c id ed to change my ha ir co l or ! !
And I ' m try ing to gr ow my ha ir out .
When my ha ir is c ur ed , I ' ll d y e it again .
I am f a m il i ar with this ha ir co l or .
B e c a us e I had black ha ir ent er ing un ive r s ity .
But I do n ' t like black ha ir because I think it is so dark and make s the face look un he al th y .
I ' ll change the to p ic .
It was such a n ic e time .
R e c ent ly my work has been bu s y so I could n ' t study hard because I do n ' t have free time . . .
but I want to keep writing j o ur n al s ! !
I think this work will one day have good re s ul t s .
T e a ch er : O K , would you please look at the se two she e t s ?
One is your so n ' s , and the other is the one of the st ud ent sit ting next to him .
F a ther : So what ' s wrong ?
D o you [ think / believe ] that my so n c he at ed because both of them w ro te the right answer ?
Q u es tion 2 , `` Where was the p or t that the B la c k S h i p s ( called the ' K ur o f un e ' in J a p an e se .
They were the first mission from the U S and sh ock ed J a p an e se people at the time both po l it ic ally and c ul t ur ally . ) called at ? `` .
There are many many p or t s in J a p an .
And my so n and that st ud ent might happen to write the same wrong answer .
My so n w ro te the right answer , and that st ud ent c he at ed .
I live in We st - J a p an where we were not affect ed by the after m a th of e ar th qu a ke dis aster .
What will happen to my life and where J a p an will go ?
No r m al life is p ri ce less , I found out after things happen ed .
But , I think , now , It is time to make an effort to sp en d life as usual as possible .
To the con t r ar y , what I can do is c ar ry ing out my respon s i b il ity for myself , my family , and my co m m un ity , so we can be able to sp en d their live s with each other .
F or J a p an , for me , and for my ch il d re n ' s g en er ation .
To day is a beautiful day , is n ' t it .
No w I feel co m f or t able in the sea s on of new gr e en leave s in J a p an .
Some day , I want to talk with my friend in S p an ish and I ho pe to become better at them soon er .

In that regard , though , we can only eat c he a p er f o o d ; J a p an e se p an c a ke s [ o k on o m i _ y a k i ] .

A n y way , let me finish my saying my re al dr e a m . work by saying
I am sorry that I re p l i ed to your commen t s l ate and I did not write my di ar y every day .
I will go back to O h i o on A p ri l 1 0 th .
R e c ent ly , a pro ble m o c c ur r ed .
M ate ri al s for da i ly ent ri es are out of st ock !
I have always looked around for something interest ing on this sit e , and co ll e c ted incident s that of ten happen to us .
I want ed to find different feel ing s among co un t ri es .
I c a n ' t re c o g n i z e such ma ter i al s for ent ri es any m or e .
I have n ' t came a cross this s l um p for a long time .
But under ne a th this s ur f a ce , some people have bad ha b it s in their job and their re l ation s h i p s in ter n ally .
They always p re ten d to be up st and ing c it i z en s but some people know their di r ty mind s .
I also dis like them because they always treat other s un f a ir ly .
They always make us a ng ry .
I wish they ' d leave as soon as possible .
It is a n ation al ho l i day in J a p an .
I think I ' ll sp en d the time watch ing mo v ies or play ing ten n is .
I ' m get ting us ed to the we a ther here , but the one thing I still c a n ' t < - get us ed to is the time while when the s un ri se s in s um m er .
It could be day light from 5 a m to 9 p m .
It ' s a little strange for me , it ' s not dark d ur ing supper time , and also we can eat dinner outside ! !
I ' m c r a z y about it .
It ' s been long time since I visit ed here last .
H i , to all of my friend s who I have me t here previous ly .
The se days I have some trouble with my room m ate .
R e c ent ly , I ' ve felt something wrong that has in v ad ed my day to day life .
In the tru th , I feel con f us ed about what to do .
There is a little b ur d en on my should er s .
F or me , I dr e ame d to become a so c i al work er not that long a g o ,
I am think ing re pe at ed ly about what to do in the future .
However s ad ly , still I still have n ' t work ed through what I am going to do for my ha p p i ness .
He l o ve s and is a d d ic ted to ex er c is e at the he al th c l u b and there f or e , he ' s been the at the front of his la p t op at his desk .
He want s to have a c a ke and eat it too all the time .
That way he ' s always have a me al be y on d mi d night and talk ing , try ing to get me to eat with him .
H is go b b ling sound give s me sleep a p ne a . It make s me a little c r a z y .
How should I tell him about my trouble s ?
I ' m in th ir d gra d e at middle school .
So myself and my class m ate s had to c le an our class ro o m and ne at ly dress in our un if or m s .
K or e an school s have quite str ic t r ul es about dress co d e and ha ir .
F or t un ate ly , my un if or m was n ' t point ed out . ( If so , we would get bad point . )
I wish that K or e an school s were more free like for e i g n school s .
To day is my day off
I study ed English from 7 a m to 9 a m this morning .
I began study ing it since last J an u ar y .
I ' m try ing to write sen t ence s us ing express ion s I ' ve re c ent ly le ar n ed . ( le ar n ed re c ent ly )
It help s me re m e m b er new express ion s .
F or the most part , all of them see m as if they are not c or re c t ow ing to a lack of p r a c t ic e .
If you try hard enough , your command of the for e i g n language which you are le ar n ing is g u ar ant e ed to be of a high le ve l ( even t u ally ) .
A t least that ' s what I would expect .
With regard s to the a f or e ment ion ed a p p ro a ch , I re c o m m en d you make in d e x c ar d s as a v o c a b ul ar y l is t .
When you le ar n something new , write it down on a c ar d .
Then , w h il st writing a di ar y in your second language , p ic k up ( or se le c t ) a c ar d from the de c k and a p p ly it .
What do you think of my me th o d of le ar n ing a new sen t ence ?
D o n ' t he s it ate to try it ( out ) .
A l s o , be p at i ent with the time need ed to b r us h up your s k i ll .
O h , and one more thing .
I almost for g ot to say this , and it is by far the most im p or t ant ti p !
With all me n tion ed way s , the most sign if ic ant hi n t still re m a in s .
The hi n t is you need L an g - 8 friend s help ing with their n at ive to n gue which is also your for e i g n language .
H a ve a n ic e day .
I have a m us c ul ar pai n .
Yes ter day , I started a new act i v ity , C a po e ir a !
I like sp or t s and I re g ul ar ly go to the g y m and train .
My good friend .
Yes ter day , my good friend came back to T a i w an from J a p an .
She had been to J a p an on ho l i day for two month s . She ' s so l u c k y !
So she ar r an g ed an a p po in t ment with me ,
I did n ' t know where we should go .
The we a ther was re ally hot ! > <
So ~ ~ I de c id ed to have after no on tea again ! !
He r school is far away from me ,
so we only ra re ly get the ch ance to see one another .
However , when we me t this time ,
it was just like we had not see n each other in two days .
It felt mi r a c ul ous . I like that feel ing . = )
I ho pe we can be good friend s for a very long time .
It is a little difficult for me to go to be d .
I have had the dr e a m for four days .
F or ex amp le , some on e who has a k n if e cha s ed me in the dr e a m ,
L a st week en d , I went to the mo v i e the at er to see the last f il m of the H ar ry P ot ter s er ies .
It was L ad ies ' day , so I could watch the f il m for only 1 0 0 0 yen .
In J a p an , it co st s a l ot to see the mo v i e in the the at er comp ar ed to for e i g n the at er s .
When I tri ed to bu y the ti c ke t for the f il m , I was re c o m m en d ed by the c l er k to watch the 3 D ver s ion , but I heard from my friend s that some people ten d to feel sick while watch ing 3 D f il m s .
E s pe c i ally the last scene of the f il m , the b at t le between H ar ry and V o l d e m or t was impress ive !
I think that I am a ra re person on this L an g - 8 ' c a us e I do n ' t think there are many J a p an e se people here .
I could n ' t be both er ed to work to day , so I s k i p p ed work .
I am a s al es person , so it is o k a y since I have a con t r a c t now a day s . ( I am the second person who has the high est s al es . )
I like : you t u b e , face b ook , mi x i , s k y pe , call of d ut y , P E S , dr in k ing , f o ot b a ll , listen ing to m us ic
as you can see , I am kind of a J a p an e se g e e k
I am not ke en on study ing English language .
I do like to he ar the English language but this is my ho b b y not for study .
I ' m do ing an in ter n s h i p but I ' m think ing about qu it ting
I work for a print ing office .
I ma in ly do the kind of simple , re pe t it ive work that any body could do
But it can of ten be a big respon s i b il ity .
While my co w or k er , who entered the office about 2 week s after me , get s better job s .
S or ry if this ent ry is ne g at ive
We ' re going to mo ve to another bu il d ing next week so to day all of us co w or k er s were pack ing a l ot of stuff .
I took some picture s with my co w or k er s as a me ment o .
A n y way I got my wish and took some good picture s .
I ' m a kind of f un - l o v ing person ; I l o ve to think ha p p y thought s all the time .
B e c a us e I have no good me m or ies of my ch il d h o o d .
H aving hung out with my bo y f ri en d since last A u g ust , I ' ve take n a l ot of picture s with him .
We went to a l ot of place s and every time I looked back at my picture s , I get a w ar m feel ing in my heart .
R ad i o A e or b ic s
D o you know what ra d i o a er o b ic s is ?
It is well know n all over J a p an .
There is no one who does not know this ex er c is e .
R ad i o a er o b ic s start s at 6 : 3 0 , which can be us ed as an al ar m clock .

My last ent ry just cross ed over into the new year .
That ' s O K , but I always get an no y ed with little things like this . . .
sorry for the ( ir re le v ant ) de ta il s .
You have still time to do what ever you for g ot to do in 2 0 0 9 : )
B o th of them have been de ad for a f e w year s .
It was so s ad to think about the `` de a th `` , but we want P ome if we had a ch ance to keep them .
No w a day s , do g s and c at s are so l d on the in ter ne t .
I know it ' s better to find f o s ter p ar ent s , but I think I want to me e t them before I de c id e to bu y them .
( You may as k what is my wish for .
H a p p y N e w Y e ar !
I want to speak English f l u ent ly this year .
To tell the tru th , I do n ' t like study ing language s .
On ce I open a te x t b ook , I start do ing something other than study ing ,
such as read ing co m ic s , watch ing te le v is ion , and play ing game s .
But this year will be different .
P le a se tea ch me an e f f ic i ent way of study ing English .
What do you think ?
This is my first time coming here . I le ar n ed of this we b s ite from my teacher and found it to be a re ally good place to study English . A t the same time , I want to make some friend s here !
My b ir th day is A p ri l 1 6
My b ir th day is on A p ri l 1 6 .
But I do n ' t know how I am going to sp en d that day !
To day , I took a pai d va c ation .
B e c a us e , a ty p h o on came to J a p an to day .
But , the ty p h o on pass ed J a p an e ar ly this morning .
So , I was re la x ed .
I went to a l i b r ar y .
I b or r ow ed the no ve l `` G re en mi le `` w it ten by S te p h en E d w in K ing .
I do n ' t know if I will finish read ing this no ve l .
But , I will try !
R e c ent ly something happen ed in my house , so I just do n ' t feel co m f or t able .
What ever my room m ate s and I will so l ve that .
This time I know the person who can be friend or just have dis t ance .
I he l d a w ed d ing ce re m on y about one month a g o .
M an y friend s and re l at ive s came to our w ed d ing ce re m on y .
I than k ed my p ar ent s and my w if e .
so I think the w ed d ing ce re m on y became sp e c i al .
And I will never for g e t that sp e c i al day .
We are a ha p p y co up le !
I feel sorry for her .
The J a p an e se are b as ic ally mo d est .
B e c a us e the J a p an e se va l u e respect for other part y .
And the J a p an e se were a g ri c ul t ur al people in an c i ent time s ,
they have gr ow n along s id e nature .
So a J a p an e se spirit de ve l op ed that respect ed nature .
This is my first di ar y ent ry .
B y the way , what are you go n n a do d ur ing sp r ing va c ation ?
Well , I ' m go n n a go to T a i w an
My brother is stay ing in T a i w an for three month s on a business tri p .
So I ' m go n n a go to T a i w an d ur ing that per i o d .
O f course , I ' m go n n a stay at my brother ' s house .
I ' m study ing C h in e se a little now ' c a us e will be sp r ing va c ation soon .
My e m o tion s
I think I am a c al m person but when I e ng age d in hard talk with my friend , I los t my ability to con t ro l my feel ing s and could n ' t say anything and I felt like I could n ' t think any m or e .
I know I could express my feel ing s better if I was c al m but what I can I do about my e m o tion s ?
I tri ed to comp o se the so ng s with English ly ri c s and if my mistake s are c or re c ted I ' ll great ly a p p re c i ate it .
= The C h il d is No M or e =
W h o se just if ic ation will help you not to feel alone ,
With o ut f e ar of the future
I ' ll s te p into the open do or
So , to day I ' ll in t ro d u ce myself .
My home town is very small and by s ur r ound ed mo un tain s and is l o c at ed in the c ent er of J a p an .
I gr e w up see ing the J a p an e se A l p s in the dis t ance from my house .
I live d with my p ar ent s and my el d er s is ter who is mar ri ed and ra is ing her so n and d aught er with her hu s b and .
We had one very c ut e w h ite c at .
On week en d s , I enjoy c ook ing , s w im m ing in the po o l , p r a c t ic ing Y o g a in my room , and read ing b ook s .
And I ' m le ar n ing J a p an e se tea ce re m on y once a week .
I ' m interest ed in J a p an e se tra d i tion al c ul ture , such as tea ce re m on y , k im on o , and J a p an e se f l ow er ar r an g e ment .
No w a day s the se are something that many J a p an e se pay money to le ar n .
Some people we ar k im on o of ten or every day ( for ex amp le , those who are o b se s s ed with J a p an e se c ul ture , who le ar n / tea ch tea ce re m on y , J a p an e se manner s and J a p an e se f l ow er ar r an g e ment s . . .
T h ough , many J a p an e se do n ' t own their K im on o and they us e a r ent al s er v ic e so they can we ar a k im on o only when they need it .
We do n ' t do tea ce re m on y in da i ly life ex c ept when our f a m il ies or our s el ve s are f a m il i ar with it .
The reason why I ' m interest ed in J a p an e se c ul ture is that we need to have s k i ll s well b al ance d in many g en re s .
And , we become e age r to le ar n every g en re e qu ally .
When I le ar n tea ce re m on y , I became e age r to le ar n good hand w ri ting , language s , be ha v i o ur , and f l ow er ar r an g e ment s .
When I le ar n mar t i al ar t s , I become e age r to le ar n be ha v i o ur .
It ' s not ne ce s s ar y that the le ve l of all our s k i ll s be ex ce ll ent .
The im p or t ant thing is that we have e qu al s k i ll s in many g en re s .
As a begin n er , you need to have every s k i ll at a begin n er ' s le ve l .
If you go in ter m ed i ate in one g en re , you need to have s k i ll s which are better than a begin n er ' s also in other g en re s .
I think J a p an e se tra d i tion al c ul ture has many more things than we can le ar n and understand through o ut our who le live s .
I will try writing about the se things I le ar n ed .
As an E ng in e er , I ' m interest ed in me d ical [ me d ic in e ? ] and te ch no l o g y .
I ho pe I can make friend s who are interest ed in the se to p ic s , and p r a c t ic e talk ing and dis c us s ing them in English .
T h an k you for read ing my long in t ro d u ction written in poor English .
D e c 1 0 th : S h re k 3
I watch ed ' S h re k 3 ' on T V to night .
It was the first time I had see n the mo v i e .
I was a little tired because I ' d been bu s y . ( another op tion )
I at e some pe ar s and dr an k something hot .
H m m , I ' m f al ling as le e p .
R e c ent ly , I b ough t an i P o d To u ch . It make s study ing English more interest ing .
In fact it is very us e ful and has a co o l de s i g n .
But one pro ble m with it is the b at ter y de c re as es in an in st ant .
B y the way , I like watch ing J a p an e se an im ation mo v ies .
This ent ry is about what I talk ed about with my friend to day :
What should I do while I am a co ll e g e st ud ent ( in other w or d s , before I gradua te and work ) . . . ?
I did an in ter n s h i p in J a p an for 6 month s , and it k il led me .
It was like this : I work ed from 8 a m to 1 0 p m , 6 days a week , and I s l ept a who le day on S un because I usual ly did n ' t sleep enough , and I felt so tired every day .
Then M on came and I work ed so hard for such a long time , M on to S at . . .
I serious ly did n ' t have any time and en er g y for in ve st ing myself in the future .
I ' m c r a z y about b ook s and usual ly read every day b as ic ally F O R F U N .
B U T I could n ' t even read d ur ing the per i o d .
How the he ll could I study something that will be ne ce s s ar y in the future ?
We students do n ' t have money .
But we have p l ent y of time .
O f course , I have to say students are also bu s y with study , part time job , e t c .
But comp ar ed to people work ing , we are a b s o l ut e ly so free .
So what I w an n a do in a co ll e g e is something which I have to sp en d a l ot of time on to get .
So far I came up with 3 things .
S er i ous ly , I think that if I study the se things before I gradua te and p re p ar e myself for the future , my life will change in a good way .
I ' d like to explain more de ta il s about those 3 things , but now I have to study for the ex a m which will be the most difficult yet ( in fact , it s k il ling me ! ! ! )
I have so many things to do .
My me m or ies of the U . K .
My st o m a ch a ch e was cause d by eat ing different f o o d , which was not s u it able for me after all . B e c a us e of my i ll ness , I could n ' t enjoy the tri p .
I ' ll never for g e t that tri p .
But she lie d down on the so f a .
And she had tea r s in her eyes .
No w she is again sleep ing on the so f a .
I went to Ya k in i ku with 1 0 people who are from the U .
We first tri ed a w k w ar d ly to speak in English .
Then , we started eat ing and dr in k ing as much as we like d .
We dr an k a l ot of be er , because they could hold their l i qu or well .
There were of ten two be er m u g s on the t able per person .
The S w ed ish man said ' ' Ka m p a i ' ' every f if te en minute s .
The thing that was most s ur p ri s ing for them that day was dr in k ing J a p an e se s a ke .
They had dr un k co l d S a ke before , and they said it ta st ed bad .
So , I asked if any of them want ed to dr in k with me , but no body want ed to .
This time I or d er ed a w ar m s a ke bo t t le with two s a ke c up s , and I p l an n ed to dr in k s l ow ly unti l we left .
I po ur ed my c up and then another one so they could try the w ar m one .
We dr an k it , then N ic k said ' ' It ta st es good . ``
Then , he started to po ur s a ke for all the in ter n ation al students , one by one .
A fter just 5 minute s , the s a ke bo t t le was e m p ty .
I was in d um b surprise , because they dr an k s a ke c up after c up .
And then I re al i z ed that was the last or d er .
So , J a p an e se should tell for e i g n er s not to dr in k s a ke like they dr in k te qu il a .
If you for g e t this , you will see the bo t t le e m p ty in a short time .
I ' ve got a reason why she stop p ed cha t ting s ud d en ly .
She sen t me a me s s age .
I attempt ed to write a di ar y unti l to day but I was n ' t able to because I was very bu s y .
To day , , I de c id ed to write in my di ar y again .
No w , I ' m study ing English hard er in or d er to make the T O E F L s c or e .
but my writing and speak ing s k i ll s is not too good .
So I ' ll try to us e this too l again .
L e ar n ing English for me is not easy , because I original ly st ud i ed G er man .
No w I have finish ed 9 th gra d e .
F in ish ing school , not in R us s i a but in I re l and .
There f or e , I need to de e p en my know led g e of English .
I went to the be a ch to go s ur f ing yesterday .
A l th ough the w a ve s were small , there were a l ot of s ur f er s in the sea .
The w a ve s were small er than previous be a ch and there were a f e w s ur f er s .
So I de c id ed to go s ur f ing at this be a ch .
The sea is a little co l d .
On the way back from the be a ch to my house , I at e ra m en .
I always want some body to c or re c t my English sen t ence s . . .
I want to speak and write English more natural ly . . .
I read a new s p a p er which said that there are many A m er ic an s who like to us e this so c i al ne t w or k , and that some on e even took days off of work just to play it at home .
I also found out that T w it ter is get ting p op ul ar in E ur o pe and A m er ic a , but here in T a i w an many te ch - g e e k s us e P l ur k more .
B e c a us e F a ce b ook has a C h in e se ver s ion , I sp ent some time re g is ter ing for an account .
It is not what I though it would be , I original ly though it was suppose d to be a B l o g in ter f a ce or something like that .
To keep up with the te ch no l o g y is very im p or t ant to me , something new in this er a may be out - of - d ate in the future .
a c u c um b er

To day is a good day . : )
R e c ent ly , I was ex t re m e ly bu s y because of the end of the f is c al year .
I had to make a do c u ment for this year ' s re s ul t s from f light train ing .
B y the way , our f light s qu ad ro n has an interest ing tra d i tion .
I work at the J a p an ' s A ir S el f D e f en se F or ce and I op er ate an F - 1 5 which is a co m b at a ir p la ne .
O ur s qu ad ro n ' s character is the T e ng u , a J a p an e se long - no s ed go b l in .
It is said that once upon a time , the T e ng u live d in M t H i k o which is the high est mo un tain around my a ir b a se .
The sha pe of the T e ng u was like a hu man being but he had w ing s and could f ly so we a d op ted it as our ma s c ot and our f light s qu ad ro n ' s g u ar d i an a ng el .
A c t u ally , each s qu ad ro n ' s f light time for the year is as s i g n ed by our head qu ar ter s .
A fter finish ing the year ' s f light s , we usual ly c l im b M t H i k o because we re p or t the s a f e comp le tion of the year ' s f light s to the T e ng u and p r a y for next year ' s f light s to be s a f e .
D o you know about the `` o c ar in a `` ?
It is a w in d in st r u ment .
I did n ' t know that .
O c ar in a play er s will try to set a G u i ness world re c or d
in a p ar k in N a g o y a tomorrow .
They are try ing to play with over 6 0 0 people all to g e ther .
We are go n n a go to the p ar k to day , so we have to or g an i z e it .
This morning , I got into trouble .
When I c l im b ed down the s ta ir s to get to the train , I twist ed my an k le .
I was with st and ing the pai n d ur ing my work , however it ' s gradua l ly get ting more and more pai n ful .
So , after my work , I went to the dr u g st or e and b ough t f o ment ation .
I want ed to see if e - b ook s are good or not .
I have been try ing to read `` The N e w Y or k T im es `` , `` W ash ing t on P o st `` , `` T im e `` and `` N e w s w e e k `` on K in d le .
I re al i z ed read ing new s p a p er s on K in d le works well , but read ing ma g a z in es does n ' t work so well .
B r ow s ing new s p a p er s by head line s is e as i er than b r ow s ing ma g a z in es by ar t ic le ti t le s . M a y b e that ' s a little more natural .
Where does this di f f er ence come from ?
M a g a z in es on K in d le in J a p an do n ' t have picture s .
It s ud d en ly started ra in ing while I was was h ing my ha ir this even ing .
That mean t the four - day long he at and we t ness had come to an end .
What ' s better is the co o l w in d has been coming .
T h an k s to the
`` Yes , just do it ! `` . I prais ed myself so much that I only at e a c up of s es ame past e , a b an an a and an a p p le as my supper .
But I know a di e t is a
rather long j o ur ne y , and it de m and s a l ot of per s is t ence and end e a v or .
I ' m in a bad mo o d to day . . . . .
I do n ' t know why . : (
A n y way , I have a J a p an e se class and a st ud ent has come to my class .
I ' ll try to my be st ,
to look on the b ri g h t side !
There is an in c o m ing hu r ri c an e in my are a .
The new s said it will come tomorrow or the day after tomorrow .
The we a ther for c a st say s there will be he a v y ra in tomorrow .
I ' m go to my office by s c o o ter every day .
I will go by train in s te ad of a s c o o ter tomorrow .
G o ing by train take s long er than usual .
I like n ic e days .
To day , I watch ed a v id e o on you t u b e .
In the v id e o , a man appeared who can speak English and J a p an e se from A ust r al i a .
He said ( in J a p an e se ) `` three ti p s of how to study a for e i g n L an g u age . ``
S e c on d , think simple .
L a st , do n ' t be sh y to us e a / the for e i g n L an g u age .
U n f or t un ate ly , I could only see the last ten mi m ut es of the game .
Yes ter day was H a ll ow e en , so my friend s & amp ; I walk ed around down t ow n we ar ing co st um es . ( G o o d ! )
There were a l ot of people we ar ing co st um es ; they were c r a z y and f un k y .
A fter that , we went to night c l u b to dance , dance , dance ! ! !
We would say : I was up all night and I do n ' t feel too good to day . There is n ' t anything to do .
We ar ing a K im on o
I have le ar n how to we ar a k im on o for about 1 year .
As a J a p an e se , I was as ha m ed that I could n ' t we ar a k im on o by myself .
So I de c id ed to le ar n how to we ar a k im on o .
It ' s re ally good for me to le ar n how to we ar a k im on o .
I ' m pro ud of the c ul ture of my country .
F or the last two month s I have made 2 round tri p s to S i b er i a and back .
D ur ing the se tri p s I change d p la ne s 1 2 time s .
And more o ver , this f a ll I took two do m est ic f light s with in the U S A .
To day , I had a P .
I ch o se to play so c c er ,
so I am very tired .
I have play ed so c c er for se ve n year s .
The W or l d C up of 2 0 0 2 was the most ex c it ing even t for me when I was in e le ment ar y school .
No w , I am in the middle of p re p ar ing for ex a m s ,
so play ing so c c er was good for a change of mo o d .
I not ic ed that M r .
He is n ' t f a m ous among J a p an e se , because he did n ' t have a pro f es s ion al care er in J a p an .
It might be possible t for him to be se le c ted for the n ation al tea m of J a p an .
There are many J a p an e se coming up big in a va ri e ty of f i el d s .
I am glad to he ar about those .
I ' m study ing A m er ic an H is t or y in the 1 9 th c ent ur y now .

I think ( a ) meeting like ( that is ) just ( was te ful pro ce s s ) ~

I ' m so ex cited and ha p p y !
S in ce I had st o m a ch a ch e for 3 days and I thought it was different from usual a ch e , this morning I saw a do c t or in the ho l i day c l in ic in our town .
Then she p re s c ri b ed two ty pe s of me d ic in e for me and told me not to dr in k al c o h o l and see a do c t or after the new year ho l i day s .
A c t u ally I did n ' t feel well when I got to the part y , and I dr an k no n - al c o h o l ic dr in k s .
On the week en d I went to the country by train .
It was an am a z ing tri p d u e to beautiful scene ry in the country .
I saw n at ive A ust r al i an an im al s such as k an g ar o o s , k o al as and many va ri e t ies of b ir d s .
I visit ed my friend to ce le b r ate her b ir th day .
To day , my un ive r s ity an no un c ed the part ic i p ant s for the language course s to study a b ro ad in D a v is , L A , and V ic t or i a .
I a p p l i ed for D a v is one , and I pass ed it .
But act u ally , I had mi x ed feel ing s .
The A ust r al i an course has f e w er co st s than the A m er ic an one .
The office was l o c at ed in the middle of the business dis t ri c t , in S h in j u ku .
The s c en ar y was over w he l m ing and the comp an y was s m ar t and de c ent .
E t o was very kind and he e m p ha s i z ed the im p or t ance of you ng er people going a b ro ad with his r ation al the or y .
If I study a b ro ad in A ust r al i a , I will study at the G o l d C o a st for two week s and enjoy e sight se e ing for around a week !
I ' m wonder ing what the place is like .
I ' ll a d d sen t ence s or write a new j o ur n al ent ry la ter because I have no time now .
The an im e `` U s a g i D ro p `` is so co o l that I watch it every week .
W at ch ing it make s me feel good .
She has been looked after by D i k i ch i since she was a p re s ch o o l kid .
D a i k i ch i took her into his care when R in ' s father di ed .
I ' m very glad to see that the co o l we a ther ' s coming !
T e a ch er said that E x p re s s ion s of f re qu en c y , sp e ed , and d ur ation do not us e ' in ' .
' There was almost a n u c le ar dis aster in last year . ' is wrong .
' There was almost a u n u c le ar dis aster last year . ' is c or re c t .
R e c ent ly I ' ve been work ing very hard .
B y the way , _ I w an n a study English more .
I w an n a speak English .
But _ I have no time and no money .
I went to work this morning .
She knew that I only started work ing 3 month s a g o , so there are many de ta il s that I still do n ' t know .
A fter she left her job was transfer r ed to me .
No w I am the only e m p l o y e e in the office .
I work very hard and I get so tired from work ing from morning ti ll even ing .
I am look ing for w ar d to the time when some on e will come to help me with all the work .
H o pe ful ly my bo s s will soon find some on e to help me .
D o you have any favor ite a u th or s in for e i g n co un t ri es ?
I think it is a great op p or t un ity to im p ro ve my writing comp re h en s ion s k i ll s .
In addition to that , I think that I can keep mo t i v at ed to write in English .
B e f or e I read her paper b a c k s in English , I did n ' t know anything about her .
I l o ve her b ook s very much because I can feel sympath y for each character in her b ook s .
S in ce she has written a to n of b ook s , I re ally would l o ve to read them all !
I ' ve never written a f an letter in English before .
I gue s s I can look for how to write for m al letter s v i a the In ter ne t , but I do n ' t know which is better , ty p ed letter s or hand written one s .
When you write f an letter s , which do you think is better ?
I also want to as k you when I write , which kind of things should I pay more at ten tion to ?
If you know , please tea ch me .
This morning , my mother - in - law called and told us a re l at ive was going to visit as well .
He was so funny and interest ing .
: D In addition , he us ed to be a pro f es s ion al so c c er play er and play ed for a n ation al so c c er tea m , so I ' m interest ed in his time as a play er .
I ho pe my ent h us i as m for so c c er will ar ous e his interest .
The most p op ul ar sp ot where many people run is around the I m pe ri al P al a ce .
There are many show er room s there for run n er s .
Some people who work near the I m pe ri al P al a ce run d ur ing their l un ch time .
I ' m going to go to a re la y ro ad ra ce on T h ur s day .
In J a p an , about a de c ad e a g o , ant i b a c ter i al good s became very p op ul ar since many you ng w ome n got w or ri ed about how c le an things were .
However , I some time s think that J a p an e se people pay too much at ten tion to c le an line s s .
In addition , it see m s that ch il d re n ten d to re ly on ant i b i ot ic s when they have a s light co l d .
My 1 1 month old b a b y had a f ever last night .
I put a s up po s it or y on him and w i p ed his back and st o m a ch with a we t to w el .
He was in the ho s p it al for 4 days just 1 0 days before , but now he ' s sick again .
To day , I saw a s n a ke in a p a th between the ri ce f i el d s .
The s n a ke hu r ri ed and past in front of me .
A fter a short time ( A fter a w h i le ) , I walk ed again when I find s c al es of the s n a ke in the bu s he s near b y ri ce f i el d s .
I talk ed with my friend s who live in J a p an by s k y pe after so long .
S in ce they have not change d a b it , I was re l i e v ed .
I listen ed to their story , they are still having a hard time d u e to e ar th qu a ke and e le c t ri c p ow er p l ant in F u ku s h im a .
J a p an e se people are in ho l i day sea s on from A p ri l through M a y 8 th .
That mean s , I do n ' t have much work !
But I ' m not sure what I should do when I have no work !
We enjoy ed sh o e s k at ing in the di m light s of street l amp s and c ar head light s .
I watch ed a mo v i e about the N B A on You T u b e .
A fter watch ing the mo v i e , I was get ting an ur g e to play b as ke t b a ll .
A c t u ally , I ' m play ing b as ke t b a ll in P E class .
So , I want to be good at it and surprise all my class m ate s !
I c aught a co l d . . . : (
And I c aught a co l d to day .
I was in good condition unti l yesterday .
but I do n ' t want to do anything now . . .
My mother said to me `` W i ll you go to the ho s p it al tomorrow ? ``
But I ha te the ho s p it al !
If I go to the ho s p it al , my co l d see m s to get w or st and I feel that my body is re ally get ting we a k er !
So , I my co l d go es away soon so I can a v o id going to the ho s p it al !
He ll o every one !
The se days I have been s up er bu s y and that ' s why I have n ' t been able to write my j o ur n al ent ry . . . ; (
P le a se c or re c t the letter be l ow .
I ' m going on a tri p in M a y and I am str u g g ling with b ook ing a ir p la ne ti c ke t s and hotel s .
I b ook ed by p h on e and they asked me to sen d them e - ma il s to con f ir m my name , our a ir p la ne s ch ed ul e and so on because of know ing our c he c k - in .
This is one I want to sen d them .
T it le : O ur f light s ch ed ul e on M a y 2 6 th
D e ar M ad a m or Sir ,
This is M a m i H a k o z a k i , who called you to day .
We have 2 people to t al .
I would like to stay the night s of M a y 2 6 th and 2 7 th ( 2 night s and 3 days ) .
I ' ll show you our a ir p la ne number and s ch ed ul e be l ow .
F light It in er ar y :
A bout s m o k ing .
B e f or e I write to my di ar y , I will say some other things .
L a st night , my e y e s ud d en ly turn ed very re d .
It is not good for my eyes .
I already know this , but I c a n ' t con t ro l myself in us ing the comp ut er .
If I c a n ' t us e the comp ut er for a day , I will feel un c o m f or t able .
I probab ly got a d d ic ted to the comp ut er just like my a d d i ction in s m o k ing .
I came to this train ing school for about 2 month s already .
I think , I can now speak some English to some on e else .
But with the last night ' s to p ic , I was n ' t to express myself .
P ro b ably , I am not interest ed in that to p ic , my v o c a b ul ar y is not enough or my English is still very poor .
L a st night , the teacher came from A m er ic a .
He is a very hand s ome guy .
But I do n ' t think he can tea ch students well .
We dis c us s ed about s m o k ing .
The to p ic is very simple .
In d i an p ar ent s tea ch their ch il d re n s m o k ing , but their least age is 2 year s old and yet , they can already s m o ke s ever al c i g ar e t te s a day .
It is normal in In d i a .
A 2 year old ch il d was s m o k ing .
He was so p h is t ic at ed like an a d ul t and can s m o ke 2 c i g ar e t te s at the same time .
P e op le were laugh ing around the ch il d .
P ar ent s should be respon s i ble for their ch il d re n . They must pro te c t and g u id e them to a right direction .
I do n ' t want to a d m it . . .
I do n ' t want to a d m it that I am a bo t t le - man .
I found out about this we b s ite a f e w days a g o , and I found it to be very help ful to me .
I want to im p ro ve my English and T ha i .
T h an k you ! !
It has been dr i z z ling since last night .
This re c ent ra in y sea s on has had he a v y ra in , thunder and light n ing .
R a in that f a ll s quiet ly c al m s down my mind .
To day I talk ed on M S N with an In d i an guy who I me t through it al k i , which is an in ter n ation al so c i al ne t w or k ing s er v ic e we b s ite .
He said that my English pro no un c i ation is re ally good , however , I could n ' t speak much .
I ' d like to be able to speak more .
3 ) about my future p l an s
ha y f ever
It see m s that I have got ten ha y f ever re c ent ly .
I get back from going outside , and I c a n ' t stop s ne e z ing and I have a run n y no se .
In J a p an we eat o se ch i .
it is a sp e c i al N e w Y e ar ' s f o o d .
R e c ent ly there are a l ot of people who bu y o se ch i .
M an y J a p an e se f o o d s are de l ic ate and take s time to p re p ar e .
I have to make one or two me n us for my hu s b and ' s family .
When ever I think about it I become very n er v ous .
It is possible to in c re a se the J a p an e se f o o d in this year . ( ? )
My d aught er go es to an in ter n ation al school ,
I have to co m m un ic ate with her teachers , friend s and p ar ent s in English .
I ho pe my English will get better if I could con t in u e writing a di ar y in English .
I ' m sorry I ' m s l ow at English .
If you can , I would be re ally glad that you could c he c k my di a ly .
This is a very high ra te of w i g h t ga in
S is a c ar - so c i e ty , I do n ' t have to walk a l ot when ever I go to some where .
He ll o , my friend s ! !
I like to read her o st or ies . . .
I ho pe to im p ro ve my e ng l ish so I can ful f i ll m y go al s ! ! . . .
Some time s I get a co l d after I am ex po s ed to other people in a c r ow ed .
I take some me d ic in e just in case .
N e ed a R e fresh er
It is the week en d , and I have p l an s to ha ng out with my friend .
I do n ' t want us e my week en d to study or do home w or k any m or e .
B e c a us e I know that study ing too much make s me become sick and str es s ed .
A fter that we will go to the p ar k to get some fresh a ir .
I have a part - time job every day ex c ept M on day .
I am a gr e e ter in a re st a ur ant .
L a st night , it was a pretty bu s y day and ( ? ) could n ' t work proper ly .
So , I want to consider what happen ed and how to p re v ent it .
I thought about three things
F ir st ly , I think the ma in pro ble m s were an in s u f f ic i en c y of co m m un ic ation and state of mind .
I mean , we were too bu s y both ment ally and physical ly to take time for other s .
S e c on d ly , the s y s te m to c he c k what was or d er ed and what we serve is not e f f ic i ent .
To so l ve the se pro ble m s , I should re la x a b it .
I mean , I should n ' t be ten se all the time .
And then , try to let other s be at e a se . *
The so l u tion can be a strong er bo n d among the ha ll stuff s !
* I want to write , I want them to re la x more
I want them to work serious ly , but be able to in ter a c t with other s
While I was there for only for a week , I was as t ound ed by the fact that A m er ic an people are get ting big g er and big g er every time I visit there .
It ' s no wonder that P re s id ent O b a m a is having trouble on the he al th in s ur ance po l ic y .
I ' ve heard that J a p an e se g en etic ally can not become so he a v y because we become sick before put ting on too much f at .
I sat still on a p la ne for 1 2 hour s on my way home , wonder ing whether the e c on o m y class sea t s are big enough for the ch u b b y A m er ic an s and I was than k ful that I had to leave the States after one year back in my high school days . I had put on 1 0 p ound s d ur ing my stay !
There ' s too much good f o o d in A m er ic a and it is very in e x p en s ive !
The G 2 0 S um m it should be s ch ed ul ed for three or four days , and not two days .
Some K or e an s have c ri t ic i z ed the G 2 0 meeting or g an i z er s .
This year we have less of e le c t ri c ity .
F or ex amp le , I will not us e a ir condition ing .
I will try to write a `` G ame P la y D i ar y `` .
I ' m play ing `` S ha d ow C o m p le x `` now .
so , I am try ing to be at In s an e and get 1 0 0 % it e m s and get to le ve l 5 0 .
Yes ter day I went to a K or e an re st a ur ant with my close f e m al e friend s .
We were ch il ling out with de l ic i ous dis he s and dr in k s .
I was invite d to go s k at ing by my friend s to day .
There were a l ot of people in the ic e r in k .
I suppose d they want ed to be good s k at er s like K im Y on a .
I ' ve never expect ed to s k ate in K or e a .
My la ng - 8 friend V N ga ve me a good idea to make a ud i o re c or d ing s in or d er to im p ro ve my pro n un c i ation .
f m s er v ic e , which see m s very well s u it ed for ta s k s such as this .
C o ul d you please listen to my first re c or d ing and let me know what you think of it ?
Yes ter day I told you that I want ed to be friend s .
I ho pe to ma in tain our good re l ation s h i p .
It is the be st sea s on in J a p an right now .
There are a l ot of full b l o ome d ch er ry b l o s s o m s .
They look s like p in k c l o ud s .
It is X m as morning here now .
I went to play C S with 2 bo y s yesterday morning .

So , I qu it e ar ly and went to be d at 1 am .

A c t u ally my S il ent N i g h t , was re ally nothing sp e c i al .
I w o ke up at night and went to watch `` P ri s on B re a k S e as on 4 `` and `` B le a ch ``
A h h h h . do you think I had a b or ing S il ent N i g h t ?
But I enjoy this life .

N ic e to me e t you !
F ro m the first day I c ut my long ha ir unti l now , I c a n ' t re m e m b er how many time s I have c ut my ha ir .
My friend s say that I ' m c r a z y over ha ir c ut s ha ha ha .
L a st S un day I c ut my ha ir again . F ir st I thought it was O K , but on M on day , when look ing again in the mi r r or , I see that . . .
may b e I look more man ly than before ha ha ha .
My ha ir now is s up er short and I wonder when it will be long enough again for me to change to a new style ^ _ _ _ ^
My de ar ha ir , please gr ow long quick ly . I want to look more f e m in in e , not man ly like this o _ _ O
I am from C h in a .
I like to listen to English so ng s .
But I feel that I am poor in English .
I am a co ll e g e st ud ent in C h in a .
I ho pe I can make friend s with you .
I just got back from a ti r ing j o ur ne y .
We dr o ve to K y us h u , which take s 8 hour s , with my hu s b and ' s s is ter who m I ' have to be n ic e to ' and her three kid s . S a w them off and me t my s is ter with her three kid s ( one of them is new ly b or n , who m I had to take care of ) at a small a ir less a p ar t ment in K um a m ot o .

I us ed to ha te such r ur al living but after watch ing people in big c it ies ( de s p ite their con ve n i ence s and go r g e ous house s ) , S h i man e is still the be st place to live and raise ch il d re n .
F re s h a ir , beautiful scene ry , people are friend ly . ( I took it for gr ant ed some time s . )
The first d ate of my life
I did not expect that it was the one I watch ed for the first d ate of my life .
A fter the gradua tion ce re m on y for j un i or high school , I called at her house by us ing the year b ook which told me her address .
My voice did not come out though I tri ed hard to talk .
No w I watch ed it again , I ' m sure this mo v i e is quite high qu al ity , and it was not fault of this mo v i e but of me that we did not have another d ate .
I like j o ke s and I m funny , I think .
B y the way , I m going to go N Y next F e b to A p ri l , so , where would you re c o m m en d ? ?
P le a se give me your idea s ! ! !
A l s o , I was in C an ad a ( V an c o u ver ) last A u g ust .

I don t mind your age , se x , or n ation al ity .
If you w an n a le ar n J a p an e se or le ar n about J a p an , I ll tea ch you .
let s talk ! ! ! !
I play ed k en d o in my / with class yesterday .
It is very ti re s ome and pai n ful , but it is very interest ing .
I j o in ed L an g - 8 yesterday . This is the dr a f t of `` A bout me `` .
S in ce I began a language ex change at `` J a p an - g u id e .
co m `` this F e b r u ar y , I have had very n ic e ex pe ri ence s teaching J a p an e se .
I have ex change d e m a il s , c or re c ted letter s written in J a p an e se , help ed with as s i g n ment s for de g re es , give n g u id ance on how to le ar n hi r a g an a for the first time , e t c .
I am sure I can c or re c t the J a p an e se sen t ence s you write and explain my c or re ction s in English , if you understand English better than J a p an e se .
To day , I will in t ro d u ce J a p an e se c ul ture .
To day ' s to p ic is `` k on b in i , ``
But J a p an e se con ve n i ence st or es are different from any other country ' s con ve n i ence st or es .
In J a p an e se con ve n i ence st or es , you can bu y anything you want , like a va ri e ty of f o o d s , gr o ce ry good s , ti c ke t s , st ation er ies , be ver age s and con f e ction er y .
In addition to this , you can with d r a w your s aving s , and sen d your b a g g age s by de l ive ry s er v ic e .
To be honest , I have n ' t been do ing well the se days .
My heart and mind are not in s y n c .
So I c a n ' t catch up with myself and am tak ing such mi s er able feel ing s out on my friend s and family some time s . . .
D o n ' t look back . It w o n ' t do any good . D o n ' t look a head . You ' ll just be mi s un d er st o o d .
D o es any body know which has h ta g is us e ful for people who want to as k n at ive J a p an e se or English - speak er s about what one does n ' t know in their second language ?
I want ed to us e la ng 8 while at work ( I mean d ur ing b re a k time )
I ' ve been try ing to sea r ch for such has h ta g s , but I could n ' t find one .
H o pe ful ly this has h ta g will be like a di ction ar y that n at ive language - speak er s can us e to tea ch no n - n at ive speak er s .
It ' s like a per f e c t di ction ar y .
The H an b o k is a tra d i tion al K or e an c l o th ing .
I want to in t ro d u ce the H an b o k to for e i g n er s because it is very co l or ful , and
has an e le g ant at m o s p he re .
It is very beautiful .
When I was you ng ,
I thought the ha n b o k was very old fashion ed and not ch ic ,
but now I think the
ha n b o k is very sp e c i al .
It also has history ,
and was our n ation al c l o th ing for a long time .
T w o hu n d r ed year s a g o , most people in K or e a w or e a ha n b o k .
To day , we can of ten see the ha n b o k through his t or ical dr a m as and w ed d ing s .
The se days , I ' ve been study ing very hard .
When I ' m study ing there , I feel very co m f or t able .
To day ' s class was kind of b or ing , but I was able to le ar n a l ot of gra m m ar .
M o st of k or e an s do n ' t us e ra d i at or s .
B e c a us e most k or e an s do n ' t we ar sh o es and of ten sit on the floor .
there ' s no c ar pe t , just w o o d floor .
I do n ' t w an n a over w or k and I need a l ot more time as my p ri v ate time .
I think that we c a n ' t de c id e anything if there are too many ch o ic e .
But There was a hu g e number of different kind s of re f er ence b ook s for le ar n ing English .
He could n ' t ch o o se only one b ook because of the over w he l m ing ch o ic e .
He gradua ted from H a m il t on C o ll e g e in N e w Y or k in 1 9 2 6 .
A fter gradua tion he became interest ed in the work of the A m er ic an be ha v i or al p s y ch o l o g is t J o h n W at s on and the Russian p s y ch o l o g is t I v an P a v l o v .
Yes I ' m a big f an of B .
It has been da ng er ous to walk outside , so the un ive r s ity had already close d class es to day .
However I ' m in the un ive r s ity in or d er to make the hand o ut by tomorrow .

In or d er to im p ro ve my English le ve l and a p p l ic ation ability , I p ic k ed out some us e ful w or d s from the te x t b ook and made ex amp le sen t ence s for each of them .
I have made a s ur ve y about the st ud ent ' s sleep ( p at ter n )
I ' m conc er n ed about my English gra d e
The sh o es are ti ed l o o se ly
When I come to this school , I have to under g o a s er ies of things
D ur ing the s um m er , there is always al ot thunder
D ur ing s um m er , there is always thunder when it ra in s .
We have had he a v y ra in in J a p an , es pe c i ally in Ka n t o A re a the se days .
The ra in was serious ly he a v y .
When the he a v y ra in s ud d en ly start s and f a ll s serious ly he a v i ly , we call it gue r ri ll a ra in .
I de c id ed to write a short di ar y every day start ing to day .
I went to Ka s a i a qu ar i um with my friend .
I enjoy ed it more than I thought : )
I want to go see the p and as at U en o z o o next time .
He ll o , every on e .

D o you have a favor ite po e m ?
I want to see a l ot of for e i g n po e m s .
O f course , I want to see J a p an e se po e m s too !
P le a se c he c k it !
A : You ' re a l i ar .
When we got to L an g - H o a L a c , our mo t or b i ke b ro ke down , so we had to look for some on e who could re p a ir it .
While we were wait ing for our mo t or b i ke to be re p a ir ed , some of my friend s were an no y ing each other .
We had to wait for 3 hour s for help . ( P l ur al for m . )
As soon as we ar ri v ed in H a T a y , my friend s de c id ed that it was too l ate to c l im b ing mo un tain , so they want ed to s w im even though I was against it .
U n f or t un ate ly , we for g ot our way home ( because the ro ut e was different ) .
On the way home , L i en ( my close friend ) re al i z ed that she had los t her b a g . She gue s s ed that she had los t it when she was stand ing next to a strange man .
There were many things in her b a g such as her p h on e , money , a watch , e t c . . .

In the end , we return ed home s a f e ly .

You do n ' t need to free z e d u e to a different en v ir on ment . ``
O k a y , I will try to have a different mind se t .
However , I am still feel ing a ch e y .
I ' m surprise d !
The D es i g n of the to p p age of L an g - 8 has been up d at ed .
I think this de s i g n is more like the de s i g n of other S N S s such as mi x i or F B .
To keep act ive us er s , S N S s have to be change d con t in u ous ly .
I ho pe L an g - 8 will be im p ro v ed more and more .
This morning , I went to the ho s p it al .
A r ound no on , I got back home .
I took a n a p for about two hour s , and then went to my sp or t ' s act i v ity class .
I am a little b it tired but I enjoy that class .
I just w ro te a j o ur n al ent ry about b a se b a ll last time , but this time I try to write about sp or t s again .
L a st night , I went to watch an N B A game for the first time , that was the P h il ad el p h i a 76 er s v s .
My friend got the ti c ke t s from his comp an y and kind ly invite d me to watch the game with him .
I have want ed to go watch the N B A since I came to the U S . , so I was re ally ex cited before ar ri v ing at the st ad i um .
The game was so ex c it ing and also the sea t was am a z ing ly good .
In fact , we sat just 2 r ow s behind the came r ame n .
That was very close to the game and the play er s !
L at er on , I not ic ed our ti c ke t s were w or th $ 3 5 0 .
A l th ough I have n ' t follow ed the N B A for a long time , I always like d watch ing the N B A when I was in j un i or high or high school .
I think the N B A was more p op ul ar then than to day .
I ' m wonder ing whether most of my L an g - 8 friend s do n ' t ( will ) re m e m b er that .
A n y way , last night I re al i z ed the N B A is still p op ul ar and I might start watch ing the game s of the 76 r s .
Some people have been on ho l i day since last week en d ,
I or d er ed some English te x t b ook s from A m a z on .
and I just got them this morning .
A l th ough , I do n ' t know whether it was because the tra n s p or t ation comp an y is f a st or that A m a z on is f a st - -
In s um m er , what is your f a v o ur ite f r u it ?
my answer is water m el on , because it ' s full of water and very de l ic i ous .
C ha ng s ha is called a st o ve c ity , one of the five st o ve c it ies in C h in a .
A ver age te m p er a ture re a ch es 39 de g re e , and some time s even more than 4 0 .
If there is nothing I have to do , I would rather stay at home .
If I were a little ch il d , s l ept in the water m el on , what a ha p p i ness it is !
My J o b
I am work ing at a school .
I help students with ma k ing do c u ment s .
But I re al is ed ( re al i z ed ) it is re ally difficult .
I think it will take between 5 and 1 0 year s to le ar n it well .
So , I have to le ar n the language more while work ing in my school .
When I open the w in d ow of the bu s , the a ir outside is so bad .
It s m e ll s like f u el . I do n ' t like the o d o ur .
I live in K un m ing , a c ity in We s ter n C h in a .
But now , with the e c on o m ic de ve l op ment , everything has change d in this c ity .
This is ter ri ble for the en v ir on ment .
There were some train ing course s which any on e could j o in , for ex amp le y o g a , dance and we i g h t train ing .
To day I j o in ed in with the bo x ing course .
I ' ve had no ex pe ri ence of it before .
To day , I watch ed T V at 1 0 a m .
The T V was show ing a dr a m a from K or e a .
The dr a m a ' s ti t le was `` On A ir `` .
The dr a m a of K or e a had hu m or and interest for me .
She s u f f er s from back - pai n and c a n ' t sit for a long time in the c ar , there f or e Ka m a k ur a is a reason able place to visit .
B e c a us e it is only about a one hour dr ive from Tokyo .
Ka r a m k ur a is an old c ity , and a f a m ous to ur is t place .
In the morning , we had a walk on the be a ch to g e ther .
The hot s um m er . . . .
H a ve you ever see n a S w e e t O s man th us p l ant ?
It ' s a f l ow er that b l o o m s in J a p an in the F a ll .
We call it `` K in m o ku se i `` .
I like it not only because it is a beautiful f l ow er but also because it s m e ll s good .
If you come to J a p an in the F a ll , please look for it .
To write an English di ar y is very hard , so I can only write a di ar y like a ch il d .
I like to s w im in my free time , I like s w im m ing because it can make you have a good body and he al th y body .
And I like to s ur f the in ter ne t too .
I like to cha t with my friend s .
C h er ry b l o s s o m s are in full b l o o m now where I live .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to see ing it .
I think many people enjoy to see the ch er ry b l o s s o m s and walk in this sea s on .
Some body go es up then other s go down .
That is the way of it .
Z ha ng , an e - ma il and as k for his help .

If it ' s not too hard please help me to c or re c t ly write an es s a y , per ha p s something need s to be c or re c ted .

If you know any a u th or s who write b ook s in beautiful English ,

We heard the `` sound s `` were coming from his room and it sound ed like sh aving sound s .
A co up le of minute s la ter he came into the living room and we tri ed to tea ch him .
The ho st told to him when you us e a ra z or , you must go to the was h room .
But he said `` I went there ! ``
And quick ly became a ng ry .
O f course our ho st was also a ng ry because we knew that he had told a lie .
In fact he never apologize d to our ho st .
We are not re al family but our ho st treat s me as a brother .
I always be ha ve honest ly because I living in his house .
Why did he have to tell a lie ?
He does n ' t see m to care about anything .
So we c a n ' t tru st him .
A fter this happen ed our ho st said to me `` when you c ook something , please c ook for him . ``
B e c a us e if he us es the st o ve he ' ll start a f i re .
M e an ing I can us e the st o ve but he c a n ' t .
This morning something else happen ed .
He always sp r a y s the water when he take s a show er .
A fter that I have to c le an it because I do n ' t like it me s s y .
So I told him that when you sp r a y the water you have to c le an it .
I told to him how to c le an it .
But he usual ly us es paper .
This time I asked him .
I know he us es paper every day .
Why c a n ' t he tell me honest ly .
No w a day s we have to think about our natural as se t s .
B e c a us e he is from S a ud i A r a b i a .
I do n ' t want to dis c ri m in ate .
S um m er va c ation E n d

I ' m look ing for w ar d to meeting all of the n ic e people in the world ! !
I believe that this who le s w in e f l u p an ic is s te er ed by the me d i a to im p ro ve the e c on o m ic sit u ation .
In my opinion , everything that has happen ed is very ar t if ic i al .
It was c re at ed to im p ro ve the s al es of me d ic in e and to get a `` k ic k `` for the p h ar m a c y de ve l op ment of va c c in es .
As well as to show people the im p or t ance of va c c in ation s and to per s u ad e people to bu y the va c c in e .
A ll over the world much more people di e because of stand ar d f l u but no one make s such a p an ic as the me d i a did in the case of s w in e f l u .
It is l o c at ed about 3 k m from M in o S t ation .

A J a p an e se mo n ke y appeared in front of us !
I saw this w il d one for the first time .

It ' s not good .
I at e Ka is en d on for my dinner , a b a ll of ri ce with some sea f o o d s .
To day , let me tell you about the town I live in in J a p an .
I live in H a y a m a .
This is a f a m ous sea s id e town in Ka n a g a w a p re f e c ture next to Tokyo .
As the J a p an e se ro y al family has a s um m er house in the town ,
re s id ent s try to ma in tain it s tra d i tion al l and s c a pe and c le an line s s .
It ' s a very small but beautiful town with al ot of nature and many re t i re es .
Some J a p an e se office work er s dr e a m about living in the town because it does n ' t have a train st ation , h ence it ' s difficult to co m m ut e to business z on es / dis t ri c t s such as those in Tokyo .
But I ch o se to live in H a y a m a de s p ite the long co m m ut e time , I work in S h im b ash i c ent r al of Tokyo .
It take s 1 h 4 0 m to co m m ut e .
I us e ally get on a train from Z us h i st ation in the next town .
I sp en d the time read ing new s p a p er s , listen ing to English po d c a st s and some time s , sleep ing .
A letter to B re n d an

A ccord ing to my family , he did n ' t s u f f er from much pai n .
One of them is to eat my favor ite J a p an e se f o o d s .
I also at e ra m en ( or C h in e se noodle ) .
R ame n is original ly from C h in a but the J a p an e se change d it s ta s te so that J a p an e se like it more .
E a ch J a p an e se l o c al c ity has their own ta st es .
M o st l o c al ra m en can be also eat en in Tokyo .
We have l ot s of f a m ous ra m en re st a ur ant s in J a p an .
Some of them run as cha in s and some of them are l o c al .
It may not be so p op ul ar but I like it .
I went to some Y o k o ha m a ra m en re st a ur ant s this time .
I will write down the l is t of good or f a m ous ra m en re st a ur ant s here .
T h ough I do n ' t know if ra m en is p op ul ar among for e i g n people , I think you should re ally try it when you come to J a p an .
I do n ' t know if the se re st a ur ant s have we b sit es written in English .
F in ally , I ' ll at ta ch e the picture of ra m en .

My So n ' s B ir th day
I came home e ar ly yesterday .
C h il d re n gr ow f aster and f aster by the year .
A little while a g o , he could n ' t even put his s ock s on by himself .
But now he can put them on .
He see m s to think for himself now and can ch o o se what he want s .
Yes ter day , I went to B as k in R o b b in s with my bo y f ri en d
We had two small ic e c re a m s to g e ther .
In fact , I want ed to have the large ic e c re a m but the small one was on s al e , so we had the small er and c he a p er one .
Even though my bad too th had sh ar p / p i er c ing pai n s because of the co l d ic e c re a m , we had enjoy able time there .
I us ed one piece of s al m on , a p ot at o , a c ar ro t and half an on ion .
F ir st I f ri ed the on ion with some g ing er and dr y re d pe p p er .
Then I a d d ed the p ot at o , c ar ro t and two sp o on s of c ur ry s a u ce , and f ri ed it a little b it more .
A fter that , I a d d ed the fish and some mi l k and s te w ed them for half an hour .
F in ally , I place d some s al t in it and the dis h was read y .
I feel like a full G ar f i el d right now .
2 5 year s have pass ed since my house was bu il t .
I like my house in that it is co m f or t able .
I ' m so re l i e v ed , I ' m re ally sleep y now .
And I ' m going to visit to O k in a w a in M ar ch ! !
E ver y th ing .
A I think I am becom ing a la z y person .
E ver y time I say that I am re ally bu s y because I have to p re p ar e to get a job , I act u ally do not do anything .
F ro m now on I will change and live like a very bu s y and pass ion ate person ! ! !
I can say `` To day was my friend s ' day ! `` because I visit ed the house of one of my English - l o ver s to cha t away in English in the morning and I me t some other friend s with our kid s to have l un ch at a co m m un ity c ent er in the after no on .
As for the cha t meeting , a mo m who is an or g an i z er of another English c l u b j o in ed us this time .
A fter the meeting , I head ed for a co m m un ity c ent er to have l un ch with ( some ) other friend s and our kid s .
l o l We r us h ed out of the room because we had to return the room ke y to the s ta f f .
A fter the l un ch , one of the friend s invite d me to have a f e w c up s of co f f e e .
I ho pe my family will be able to have our own house in the future . . . . .
I ' m try ing to make my c ir c le of friend s big g er and big g er .
my house p h on e has b ro k en down
As it has been ra in ing he a v i ly since last night , my w if e sen t my so n s and me to their school and my office by c ar this morning .
T h an k s to her !
B e f or e no on , I got a p h on e call from my house make r .
He said that he p l an n ed No v 2 5 th as the day of the f in ance l o an .
I was so surprise d since there was not enough time for me to p re p ar e for some pro c ed ur es .
I called the f in ance comp an y and he said he was w or ri ed about the pro c ed ur es too .
I asked my house make r and to change the day to No v 3 0 th .
My w if e sen t me an e - ma il that our house p h on e with f a c s im i le has b ro k en down .
S in ce last week , the f a c s im i le has been act ing up .
On ce she tri ed to turn off the p ow er and turn it on again , it b ro ke down !
So I will call the s er v ic e c ent er of the man u f a c ture r tomorrow .
And I called my friend who was my al um n us and was a tax account ant .
I asked him about some tax pro ble m s .
But it was difficult to explain it on the p h on e , so I sen t him an e - ma il about it before this .
I understand that it is difficult to explain in writing , too !
M an y J a p an e se people see m to be writing di ar ies about the s n ow .
I am w or ri ed about going s a f e ly to the comp an y .
However , my d aught er was ha p p i ly play ing in the s n ow .
My father and I have a co m m on f e a ture .
F ur ther m or e , my mother told me that it was a good f e a ture .
C on t in u ing to do something is very wonder ful .
* This di ar y con t in u es from di ar y No . 1 .
As the boat ar ri v ed there , every on e went out the boat with their friend s .
And I went out there by myself with my s ad feel ing s .
A t first , since I did not know K e el un g , I went to the to ur is t i nformation c ent er .
And I was able to ar r ive there soon .
B e f or e coming to K e el un g , I heard the r um or about A C ity of S ad ness .
The C ity of S ad ness was f a m ous for the ta i w an mo v i e ' s st age .
I ga ve up it because it need ed too much time .
If I went to there , I could n ' th a ve go ne to other f a m ous place s .
N e x t I asked her `` What place s do you re c o m m en d in this c ity ? ``
She told me `` You could go to the F a ir y C a ve ? `` .
So I de c id ed to go there .
to be con t in u ed . . .
My name ' s L in h .
I ' m 2 0 year s old and I ' m from V i e t n a m .
I ' ve been str u g g ling to understand `` It `` and `` That `` .
I feel when I us e `` It `` , `` It `` de s c ri b es some kind of im age .
It see m s a long long way .
Some f an c y thought s to ce le b r ate a b ir th day
I ' d like to sha re some strange thought s with you on how I ' d like to or g an i z e a f an c y part y .
Let ' s im a g in e I am p l an n ing a sp e c i al b ir th day for myself .
When I ce le b r ate my b ir th day , I will invite a l ot of friend s . I ' d also like to re s er ve a big , beautiful p al a ce , far away from the country .
I ' d de c or ate it with sp e c i al b a ll o on s with my name and the name s of my family and friend s on a b a ll o on .
This b ir th day will have to be a sp e c i al one .
When I invite my friend s and they come over , an a ir p la ne will be wait ing for them .
They will be serve d anything they want , as well as receiv ing their own sp e c i al and ex p en s ive g if t s that I have want ed to give them for a long time .
A ll this will take place after we view a f i re w or k s display to start things off .
When the f i re w or k s ex p l o d e , it will sp e ll my name and display my like ness in the night s k y .
F in ally , I would like for you to give me mo r al s up p or t .
I do n ' t need money or anything , but just a respon se as to what you think of my idea . W o ul d you be sat is f i ed with it ?
L ate ly , my comp an y has de c id ed that it need s to have a we b s ite c re at ed .
So far , we have only need ed a st at ic we b sit e and not a d y n a m ic one , so we do n ' t need a da ta b a se .
I was interest ed in this new p l an , al th ough I knew that my s k i ll s at de s i g n ing we b sit es c a n ' t be comp ar ed to that of a pro f es s ion al de s i g n er or e ng in e er .
I still want ed to try , so I asked my friend to copy W in d ow s serve r 2 0 0 3 and D re a m w e a ver for me .
My p l an is to de s i g n it us ing D re a m w e a ver , and when it is done , take it on line us ing S er ver 2 0 0 3 .
I ho pe that one day I can man age our serve r .
So after get ting off work , I ' ll go to my go d f a ther ' s noodle s sh op and then go to a l i b r ar y near b y to b or r ow re la ted b ook s .
And this can also el im in ate what cause s con f l ic t s , such as mi s un d er st and ing about their c ust o m s ,
To tell the tru th , l have n ' t read any b ook s re c ent ly because l have been so bu s y re c ent ly .
want ed to tea ch p re c ept s to his b a b y .
but his b a b y was so you ng . he had no time to wait for his b a b y to gr ow up .
and he de ter m in ed that he will do `` The last conc er t `` for his you ng b a b y .
when after the b a b y has gr ow n up , and after he di ed , he can still tea ch
his p re c ept s to his ch il d re n / ch il d .
The last conc er t was so impress ive d to me .
es pe c a il ly , the b ook made me think of a dr e a m I for g ot when I was you ng .
I to as ted some b re ad with the to aster and I at e the b re ad without sp re ad ing anything on it .
The b re ad s m el led good . & n b s p ; It was very c ri s p y so I end ed up eat ing all of the b re ad .
My so n and d aught er will have sp or t s f est i v al at their n ur se ry school this F ri day .
My hu s b and , our p ar ent s , and I will go to c he er them .
I wish we have a clear s k y !
My think ing at l est least di f f r l ent different .
To m or r ow we will get our first we s ter n c ul ture ex a m .
I ho pe we can w al t z through .

I was on M S N for a long time with some on e in U S A .
I do n ' t know ex a c t ly when I can us e `` any `` in sen t ence . I know it ' s difficult to explain .
She sleep s too l ate .
She said this was because she usual ly read b ook s .
She does n ' t like to eat b re a k f a st in the morning before she go es to school .
and also l un ch .
I asked her p re m is ( ? ) me to eat b re a k f a st before going to school .
She said she p re m is ( ? ) eat b re a k f a st in the morning .
I do n ' t understand some w or d s and I have a talk ing di ction ar y but
I would like to th r ow it far away from me .
And I do n ' t want to open a di ction ar y any m or e .
What I study at un ive r s ity is ma in ly sub j e c t s re la ted to English , such as English ling u is t ic s , English education , A m er ic an and B ri t ish litera ture and so on .
I want to tea ch English to high school students p re p ar ing for un ive r s ity ex a m s , so I ' m here to im p ro ve my English .

He set a d ate for 6 . 3 0 p m and asked me where I would like to me e t .

S u ch as his job , his l and l or d , pro no un c ing number s in C h in e se , my family her it age , my house , my c at , and other s .
We also sh ar ed our thought s about the c or re l ation between money and ha p p i ness , free d o m , and tra ve ling .
That night mean t something to me , because our con ver s ation s have mo v ed from pe t ty r and o m to p ic s to de e p er sub j e c t s .
I felt some c he m is t ry between us .
I would like to re c i p ro c ate by to u ch ing him back , but I could n ' t do that .
I am not sure that he re ally like s me or if he just want s to take a d v ant age of me .
One thing for sure I enjoy his comp an ion s h i p .

This morning , she came home from her morning ex er c is e gr o up in the ne i g h b or h o o d and said ,

N e w year ' s day is already over as you and I know , but I still feel like I have n ' t re g a in ed the en er g y I had last year .
It may be because of the new year ' s ho l i day s , no , I k ic k ed back too much d ur ing the ho l i day s .
My en er g y le ve l and ent h us i as m might have f al le n down while I was sp en d ing time on dr in k ing and just watch ing T V .
H o l i day s sound re ally good to me , but it see m s to be not good for my body . . .

He is one of the most f a m ous J a p an e se pai n ter s
4 0 0 year s have pass ed since his de a th .
and his ex b i tion is he l d this year in K Y O T O .
My mother tri ed to go there , but it is very p op ul ar and she had to wait in line for more than one or two hour s . . .
If you are interest ed in old J a p an e se pai n ting s you should c he c k out this sit e .
L a st S at ur day , I re la x ed in my home with my family .
Yes ter day ( S un day ) , I play ed go l f .
S um m er will come soon !
I am going to K y ot o for a p re n at al c he c k up tomorrow .
I want to enjoy some time with them as well .
No z im i , is the name of the S h in k an s en bu ll e t train , it is the f a st est and most co m f or t able train on the J R To k a i line .
I wish that you might enjoy a visit to K y ot o some day .
la z y i v y say s he ll o o o o o o o : (
However , I still for g e t or find any other ex c us e to being la z y .
It ' s a re al draw b a c k of my person al ity .
`` The trouble with I v y was that she never had a sp e c if ic a im in life . ``
B e c a us e of the no is e , I could n ' t re c or d the l at ter part of the story d ur ing the day time .
so I ' ll do it this even ing : )
To day I found some very interest ing v id e o b l o g s made by K o i ch i , or to f u g u .
H is v id e o s are a w es ome and he has a great sen se of hu m or .
I wish I could make v id e o s like him : D
I ' ve just sign ed up for it !
It sound s am a z ing , does n ' t it ?
I mean , I want to give them a present .
What I want ed to as k you guy s is , what would you b r ing if you visit ed your friend ' s p ar ent s house ?
I ' m not f a m il i ar with we s ter n c ul ture and it ' s little b it we ir d to as k her what I
I want to c or re c t some po st s written by other me m b er s on la ng - 8 .
I thought , `` It ' s easy if I write po st s in my language . ``
But I will try to con t in u e to make c or re ction s .
It I s ex a c t ly 2 5 minute s before my b ir th day .
In the morning , there was sea w e ed so up for me , my mo m made it .
I like the sea w e ed so up because it is so de l ic i ous to eat .
I went a head and went to school in a good mo o d .
I A r ri v ed at school and then open my l ock er to take out b ook s , the moment I did not con ce al surprise s .
My b ir th day present was that my be st friend ga ve my l ock er de c or ation s .
That put up with tea r s .
B e c a us e it was the first such even t in my life that made me ha p p i er
I have had express ed my gra t it ud e to my friend s . ( more natural )
So I since re ly con g r at ul ate my friend s and be ha p p y .
To day is the be st day in my life .
I always will not for g e t this b ir th day .
But the reason s why we call him like that is because he is a b it short and he look s so c ut e like a D or e m on .
He would think that we m ock ed him .
T h an k you for read ing my writing / ent ry .
co l d we a ther
To day is T h ur s day .
The co l d we a ther outside is ma k ing me co l d .
Even though I ' m co l d , I will do my be st .
I b ro ke up with my bo y f ri en d . . .
One reason is that he wish es to work in C h in a .
A no ther reason may be that there is another person between us .
In fact , I feel very s ad , but I still need to work , eat , and so on .
L if e is hard . .
I want new one !
No w I ' m gr ow ing some s c a ll ion s , turn i p s , and let t u ce .
Yes ter day , I me t a friend in our L a b who had gradua ted from the U n ive r s ity .
I was very surprise d and ex cited .
I think we ' ll be very bu s y in the future , but I want to con t in u e the re l ation s h i p .
I ho pe he will work well .
There was the p h r a se `` This had better be good `` in a di al o gue in my te x t b ook .
When she tri es explain ing one is s u e , the s al es direct or as k s her to mo ve on to the next to p ic because it was already me n tion ed in another person ' s present ation .
Then her bo s s tell s the s al es direct or that she ' s got some new idea s that are w or th listen ing to .
And then the direct or tell s her , `` O K , this better be good . `` , and she answer s `` R i g h t . ``
Then I walk around near the bu s st ation we ar ing v o l un te er c l o th es so that other people can o b v i ous ly see me .
I feel very ha p p y help ing other people .
As we know , un or d er ed p h en ome n a can be see n every where in C h in a , and I ho pe the se sit u ation s will be change d .
and I ho pe our country become s a beautiful one .
just like the s l o g an of the S ha ng ha i E x po `` better c ity , better life `` .
S t u f f ing You r st o m a ch With f o o d is im p or t ant to s up p re s s the sen s ation of hung er .
You might think that you ga in body we i g h t if you eat a l ot ,
y es , you are right .
But if you eat a high v o l um e of l ow c al or i e f o o d s , you will be sat is f i ed with them without long ter m we i g h t ga in .
F or ex amp le c a b b age and let t u ce have , respect ive ly only 2 3 and 1 5 k c al per 1 0 0 g .
Even if 2 k g ( ! ) of let t u ce is con s um ed , you will take in only 3 0 0 k c al which c or re s p on d s to 33 g of f at or the en er g y sp ent in just sit ting for five four s .
K on j a c and a g ar are p ri m ar i ly c al or i e - free and can be ut il i z ed to in c re a se the v o l um e of di e t s as can l ow c al or i e ve g e t able s such as c a b b age and let t u ce .
O f course , if 2 k g of f o o d or dr in k are con s um ed , there is a tra n s i ent we i g h t ga in of 2 k g .
This is e m p ha s i z ed in e p is o d e of eat ing dis or d er ( E D ) p at i ent s , because they strong ly f e ar ga in ing we i g h t even if the we i g h t ga in is tra n s i ent .
I think this one ta st es good but my E ur o pe an friend s do n ' t see m to like it that much .
They prefer be e f to p or k .
A n y way , when we got there , we were the only c ust ome r s in this re st a ur ant .
No w that was may b e because it was little b it e ar ly for dinner .
No matter what any on e tell s us , we started dr in k ing from 5 P M .
A fter 2 hour s , we had finish ed about 5 bo t t le s of So j u which is a kind of tra d i tion al K or e an al c o h o l .
So j u con tain s around 2 0 % al c o h o l , which mean s it ' s pretty strong .
That ' s why all of us got pretty dr un k .
A fter w ar d s , we went to C h in a town where we dr an k more al c o h o l .
I to t ally b l an k ed out so I could n ' t re m e m b er what was going on .
I must have do z ed off for a while and then when I open ed my eyes , I felt something strange .
Then I re al i z ed that I ' d pass ed 6 st ation s from where I was suppose d to get off the train .
In the end , I had to call my c ous in for him to give me a ri d e .
It was almost 2 A M .
A fter I came to my sweet home ,
T h ing s are look ing up .
I go to the s al on to change my ha ir style .
just as was expect ed , my ha ir de s i g n er was very kind .
A fter I tell the de s i g n er about what I want for a ha ir style , I do n ' t care while he is cha ng ing my ha ir style .
why do n ' t I care while he ' s cha ng ing my ha ir style ?
because I believe ( tru st ) him .
A fter finish ing that , I was very ha p p y .
because I was sat is f i ed with my change d ha ir style .
T w o week s a g o , I b ough t a b ic y c le machi ne which I can us e in my place .
It ' s one of the f a m ous sp or ting good s for those people who do not go outside or re g is ter g y m ( I c or re c ted it because it was a w k w ar d ) .
I think there are a f e w a d v ant age s by us ing this ( machi ne ? ) .
F ir st , it make s me to s w e at easily than what I expect before and this mean s that it is also help ful as an a er o b ic ex er c is e .
A c t u ally , I will re g re t if I do n ' t go to g y m after I re g is ter month ly me m b er s h i p
A l th ough there are some [ a b n or m al ( a w k w ar d ) ] no is es , when I p ed al a b ic y c le , the over al re s ul t of us ing this b ic y c le is sat is f y ing .
I was in the big e ar th qu a ke with my d aught er s at home last F ri day after no on .
As soon as I felt the qu a ke , we went under the t able to pro te c t our head s and open ed the front do or and w in d ow to get an es c a pe ro ut e .
A l ot of things f e ll down off of the she l ve s .
But I stop p ed them , because being outside would be more da ng er ous than being inside in Tokyo , where there are so many bu il d ing s .
That and my a p ar t ment is re l at ive ly new and e ar th qu a ke - pro o f .
This is because the s a f e g u ar d for the ga s was work ing .
F or t un ate ly , we could us e water and e le c t ri c p ow er .
We at e in st ant need le s by bo il ing the water with e le c t ri c p ow er .
No w , we can us e ga s again .
But some ne ce s s it ies for every day life are lack ing , such as to i le t paper , ti s s u es and dr y b at ter ies .
A t last , I was able to bu y to i le t paper and dr y b at ter ies this morning .
I ho pe things will return to normal soon .
I ' m watch ing b a se b a ll on T V .
because this is a good game last ing over 5 hour s .
It is f un for me who ever w in s .

He has been to g e ther with me for five year s .
It is my first time writing an English ar t ic le .
M a y b e my heart is afraid or n er v ous .
Besides , my ma j or is not C h in e se .
I qu it m y job a month a g o because I ha ted being an A d m in As s is t ant .
I like study ing language s , help ing people can make me feel ha p p y .

W h o can help me ?
My friend s suggest ed they would put ce ment ti le s on my k it ch en wall . They then asked which co l or I like d more from / out of gra y , w h ite and be i g e .
I answered w h ite would be great but not to r us h cause we may have to mo ve out this month .
She said that `` some on e will qu it their job on the 2 0 th of A u g ust in M or i bu d in A k as a k a .
And every on e want s you back over there , can you do it ? ? ? ``
A c t u ally I qu it the job last year , but at my last job I was always think ing how n ic e it was to work in Tokyo .
I re ally enjoy ed work ing over there .
Even my s is ter said to me , `` You should go back to the job ! ! I I ' m 2 0 0 % sure of it ! !
A t time s like th e se , I make sure to eat something that will put me to sleep as soon as I lie down .
My favor ite kind of tea is ic e e ar l gr e y ic ed tea .

But I will run out of those leave s by the end of this s um m er .
I must look for good leave s from another bra n d .

every on e ! !
I have been a u ction ing it e m s on the In ter ne t since last year .
The reason why I started this a u ction is
to c le an ing my room .
But now , it became a very im p or t ant so ur ce of in c ome for me .
H a ve you ex pe ri ence d a u ction ing on the In ter ne t ?
I felt this mo v i e is something even a d ul t should see .
A t the moment 3 D mo v ies are hot in J a p an .
I ' ve been ex ha ust ed the past f e w days .
I think it is str es s cause d by the ter ri ble e ar th qu a ke .
But I think I should have a more po s it ive at t it ud e .
U p on see ing what I b ough t , my little so n looked dis a p po in ted because I b ough t more c l o th es for his el d er brother and did n ' t bu y short s for him which I told him that I would bu y one for him .
M an y an im al s have los t their own ha b it at s !
L ate ly in K or e a many en v i or n ment al pro ble m s have o c c ur ed be c u a se of F o ur R ive r Project .
the go ver n ment said it will be help ful to K or e a ' s e c on o m y .
But many people did not agree with the go ver n ment because they think it will be us e less .
The go ver n ment also say s that this will become a to ur is t at t r a ction , but it will not .
They de st ro y ed f a m ous place s with great natural l and s c a pe s and also dr o ve many an im al s and p l ant s from their own ha b it at s .
The go ver n ment did not care about the people ' s comp la in t s because of the be ne f it s .
I want more people in the world to know about this and become interest ed in it .
R i g h t now I ' m listen ing to S m o k i e ' s `` L i v ing next to do or A l ic e `` .
As I did n ' t know the mean ing of the ly ri c s , I was s ad for no reason .
A fter know ing the mean ing of the ly ri c s , I feel so s ad .
When I feel a little b l u e , I listen to s ad so ng s like this .
* If you want to listen to the m us ic
U e m ur a A i k o is a s k i ing play er who los t her game .
I think that the 4 th place was a great re s ul t even though she was n ' t able to get any me d al .
That ' s why she is c ur r ent ly at the 4 th in the world .
There are many s k i ing play er s in the world , so she ' s great .
I ' m c he er ing for M a o As ad a .
She p r a c t ic es f i g ur e s k at ing with all her might .
I have to bu y some g l o ve s .
My friend told me about this we b s ite !
So I will try to us e this we b s ite to le ar n more English and make friend s !
I am us ing simple English v o c a b ul ar y to write this di ar y .
I have been a b ro ad for 2 month s to study English in C an ad a . But , I have n ' t spoke n English since .
I want to im p ro ve my E ng l s i h .
T H A N K S
I like English very much but my English writing is too bad .
I ' m very ha p p y that all of you can see my poor w or d s , and please do n ' t laugh at me .
To day is A u g ust 8 th ; 3 days have pass ed since I came here .
She give s me at t ent ive care , c ook s very well , and most im p or t ant ly talk s a l ot , which is good for language le ar n ing .
I think I had an a us p ic i ous start here ! I went to school to day for the first time .
However , they were all n ic e ; I think we can be good friend s .
* A re there va ri ous line s between j o ke s , straight line s , c ur v ed line s , and z i g z a g line s ?
We call the year - end part y bo n en k a i .
So a bo n en k a i is a part y for for g e t ting the past year .
We for g e t the trouble s of the past year , and we start the new year .
This time I will try to read this b ook in English .
H ar u k i M ur a k a m i is one of the f a m ous J a p an e se write r s in E ur o pe but I think that it is difficult to tra n s l ate his works because his way of writing no ve l s is re ally a b st r a c t and is n ' t o b v i ous .
When he got the F r an z Ka f k a p ri z e in 2 0 0 6 , he qu ot ed a sen t ence from the letter of F r an z Ka f k a to his friend .
We have two ma in purpose s in going to H o k k a id o ; one purpose was , of course , to go sight se e ing , and the other was to go to the F u j if a b ri c conc er t s .
This is the second time I went to H o k k a id o in my life , and when I went to H o k k a id o two year s a g o for the first time , I went with ex a c t ly the same friend s with the same purpose !
The conc er t s were great ( we went to two conc er t s , both he l d in S a p po ro ) and we at e many de l ic i ous me al s includ ing s us h i , c ur ry and noodle s , and b ough t many so u ve n ir s .
This time , we went to O t ar u , which is about a one - hour train ri d e no r th w est of S a p po ro .
The ma in street was c r ow d ed with so many to ur is t s , who came from home and a b ro ad .
The town has a un i qu e at m o s p he re with a l ot of no st al g ic bu il d ing s so no wonder so many people are at t r a c ted to the town .
It was e ar ly O c t o b er and just start ing to become ch il ly , but not too co l d as one might expect .
The se days , I ' m do ing a part time job to s a ve up for a tri p to E ng l and .
I think that I can s a ve enough money by s um m er to take the tri p .
In my un ive r s ity I set up a big go al and a small go al .
B e f or e I took the class , I only read my v o c a b ul ar y not e b ook for about three time s a week , but I le ar n ed many str ate g ies in how to ex p and my v o c a b ul ar y in my un ive r s ity .

It in c re as es my con f id ence very much .
M or e o ver , I put v o c a b ul ar y ta g s on my f un i ture .

It is a good ch ance of cha ng ing my person al ity .

When I heard about how I can put some me s s age s and commen t s on la ng - 8 with my ce ll p h on e , I want study English again .

I agree with him because some r ul es in the so c i e ty are made to please a gr o up of people , and this gr o up is expect ing other gr o up s to agree with them .

A fter watch ing a his t or ical mo v i e I always c he c k W i k i p ed i a to cross ch e c k the his t or ical i nformation .
This is my first di ar y ent ry .
I j o in ed this s er v ic e five minute s a g o .

In the mo v i e , the ma in character , act ed by M il la J o v o v i ch , tri ed to help people who could not leave a bu il d ing because there were many un d e ad outside .
We were re ally ex cited about the story but some time s were not able to look at the s c re en because there were some gr ot es qu e scene s .
A fter watch ing the mo v i e , we went to a b ook st or e and b ough t a b ook that tea ch es the English al p ha b e t to ch il d re n .
A c t u ally , my w if e is p re g n ant and we p re p ar ing for my ch il d re n .
We came back to our home t ow n and went to an In d i an re st a ur ant that we had never been to .
We were as t on ish ed because , in J a p an , there are not so many for e i g n re st a ur ant s which last over five year s .
A fter eat ing , we pro m is ed that we would come here again .
P le a se c or re c t my di ar y ent ry .
A c t u ally , I st ud i ed English in another way but I think the most im p or t ant thing is to con ve y your thought s in the language you want to .
And it ' s better to get it c or re c ted by n at ive speak er s and to study from there / an a ly z e the co re ction s .
I re al i z ed again how co m f or ting it is to be with them . : D
It is also n ic e to be with the girl that I ' ve l o v ed for a long while but this am b i g u ous re l ation s h i p is now str a in ing my heart a little .
L a st S un day I went out on a d ate with her , but when I was with her I could n ' t be
my normal s el f x D .
I want to feel re la x when I am be s id en e x t to her ! !
I am a not la z y mother I think , but some time s I am s el f ish .
So I have p l ent y of time to do anything I want .
That one is called S e ve n P ound s
I still c a n ' t de s c ri b e the se mo v ies in English , but I had a good time watch ing them , and I also le ar n t some new w or d s and some p h r as es from the mo v ies .
I might have been st u c k in the house because of the s n ow if I w o ke up little b it la ter .
I came to my office before it started s n ow ing he a v i ly .

While walk ing , I not ic ed the leave s on the tree s were bu d d ing and were p re p ar ing for the coming sp r ing , even though the we a ther was co l d and r ough .

I went on a tri p with teachers yesterday .
A t S h ow a no machi , they re p re s ent ed the show a per i o d , so I felt a good old me m or y r us h into my mind .
That ' s why some time s I want to give up but my con s c i ence does n ' t let me do this , even because I will need it while living here .
To day one question in English came up to my mind .
T h an k s !

So please help me b r us h up on my e ng l ish !

This is very co m m on in J a p an .

And they will be become p ar ent s of a bo y !
I want to be able to speak English well !
What is your ho b b y ?
My ho b b y is play ing the g u it ar .
L a st night I saw a mo v i e , which ti t le is `` U p In The A ir `` .
The mo v i e had a very mo v ing story .
I think it is im p or t ant to have friend s , l o ver s , and family .
In mo v i e , there is such question that one of the character s as k s :
When I think about it there are many people around me ,
that are always s up p or ting me .
W h i ch is why I feel ha p p y to day .
I think I am more than k ful for my friend s , l o ver , and family because of the mo v i e .
We have our first w ed d ing an n ive r s ar y on the F e b r u ar y 1 4 th .
It is M on day , so we have a small home part y on S un day , 1 3 th .
My p ar ent s and my a un t will come to our house for l un ch to ce le b r ate us .
W h o is my tru e s el f ?
So , there are things we dis like ; no ne th e less , we ten d to say `` I like that `` .
If something is a se c re t , you c a n ' t tell your friend s . : )
What should I do ?
What can I d o ?
Why c a n ' t we just tell the tru th about things .
So now the only thing we can do is keep our f ing er s cross ed !
I live with my house m ate , name d E n a .
She im m i g r at ed from K or e a to A m er ic a 1 5 year s a g o .
When I came to the U S A , I was look ing for ho us ing .
So I found E n a ' s a p ar t ment on the in ter ne t .
A fter talk ing with her , I mo v ed into this place .
When I ar ri v ed to this a p ar t ment , I had for g ot ten that she has 3 d aught er s called M in a , T al i , and M ir a .
I think M in a look s like her father , but I ' m not sure because she does n ' t look like E n a .
She is a b it st u b b or n , but very sweet , out g o ing , and s m ar t .
M ir a is 4 year s old , but she is a very hard ( ? ) girl .
I have never me t a girl like this before .
Some time she is very l o ve ly when I give her some ch o c o l ate s .
Some time I ' m think ing like that . ( un c le ar sen t ence )
If I re f us ed to live with her d aught er s , my life in S an F r an c is c o would have been very different .
: ) The first month , when I started to live with them , I felt very n er v ous and str es s ed .
But now , I can feel co m f or t able and I know how put myself into another ' s place .
I s this c or re c t : ' A n a ly s is on an E ar ly M o d er n English P la y ' ?
The e ar th qu a ke s s c ar e me , but I can stay in my home at least .
I even have water s up p ly and e le c t ri c ity s up p ly since last night .
The da ng er of a n u c le ar dis aster also make s me ho r ri f i ed .
I do n ' t have much i nformation or know led g e about it .
I went to see a l ot of ch er ry tree s in O s a k a about se ve n year s a g o .
There is a f a m ous place to see them in O s a k a called Z O U H E I K Y O K U .
There was a street about 1 0 0 me ter s long and va ri ous ch er ry tree s line d up on both side s of it .
It was re ally beautiful !
I ' d never know n that there were so many kind s of ch er ry b l o s s o m s . I ' d never see n gr e en one s in my life before .
That was very s ur p ri s ing to me .
I want to go some where sp e c i al for to see ch er ry b l o s s o m s this year too .
The se day s some of my co w or k er s have got co l d s and we ar ma s k s .
Let me co un t . . . there is my bo s s , tea m me m b er ( he ' s a b s ent to day ) and three other co w er k er s . . almost one th ir d of my se ction .
I gue s s it ' s sp re ad ing quick er than the past year s because I ' ve never see n such a scene .
If you live in J a p an e , pay at ten tion to your he al th .
I ' m b re a k ing my re c or d of keep ing good he al th for at least two year s : )
I did n ' t understand the con t ent of the mo v i e very much when I watch ed the mo v i e for the first time because I was w or se at English then .
C ri m s on c l o ud s
C ri m s on c l o ud s are re ally beautiful .
My mother and I took a walk this even ing .
And the s k y ' s co l o ur was re f le c ted on the la ke .
L ot s of people who were play ing out d o or s said that this kind of scene ry was re ally beautiful .
I took a picture of the c l o ud s
I have n ' t us ed English for a long time .
I think I for g ot all of the gra m m ar and v o c a b ul ar y .
So , If I have time then I will try to write my di ar y in English .
The so c c er ma t ch between K or e a and J a p an is start ing now .
K or e a and J a p an have been so c c er ri v al s for a long time . This sound s more natural .
We be t on how our tea m will s c or e a go al with the money that pai d for the dr in k s .
A f e w minute s a g o , I was talk ing with my girl f ri en d .
I had n ' t spoke n with her in 2 week s .
So it was re ally n ic e ! ! ! !
However , w a k ing up e ar ly is one of her we a k point s ! !

I am 1 6 k g he a v i er than when I was 2 0 year s old .
I take care of myself , eat right , and ex er c is e .
I walk outside 2 0 minute s a day .
I do n ' t eat after dinner .
But , some time s I over e at .
O se ch i ! ! ( A J a p an e se tra d i tion al dis h )
I so l d O se ch i .
there were many kind s of O se ch i .
F or ex amp le , D ate m a k i , K ur o m ame , K ur i k in t on e t c .
J a p an e se people usual ly eat it on J an u ar y 1 st .
The purpose of my part time job for me was to eat the most de l ic i ous dis h in the c a f e ter i a .
To day , I at e the B i b in b a set !
It was de l ic i ous and it s co st was l ow : 3 8 0 y en .
I enjoy ed my part time job !
I have been le ar n ing English in school since I was five , so I should be re ally good at it .
I thought that now is the ra in y sea s on in N Y as well as in J a p an .
But , my co ll e a gue told me that there is not a ra in y sea s on in N Y and the we a ther this year is un like the usual in N Y .
I felt the c l im ate in J a p an was get ting w ar m er and w ar m er in s ever al year s .
I wonder ed if J a p an became a part of So ut he a st As i a in a respect .
We can see ex t r a or d in ar y c l im ate in every are a a cross the g l o b e .
It ' s time to serious ly take into consider ation this en v ir on ment al is s u e .
He ll o , every on e ! My for e i g n language teacher told me about this sit e . I had hard ly open ed my la p t op when I came back home and made my first di ar y ent ry . I ho pe I can make more new friend s from around the world .
Why the ch il d like s s and ?
This sen ten se explain s the ch il d re n ` s l i k ing .
A ll of my three d aught er s like s and and they play with it .
E s pe c i ally , the minute and s m o o th one s .
I was give n many f e a st s like a s and ri ce b a ll , a s and p an c a ke , a s and j u ic e , a s and me at , , e t c .
I think that they feel a sp e c i al va l u e about s and s .
I can not re l ate because I am an el d er ly man .
How to im p ro ve listen ing s k i ll s
It ' s very funny to me .
What other sit c o m s do you re c o m m en d ?
I pack ed my thing a to mo ve to P r u e t t ' s house tomorrow and was so tired from this work that I started to watch `` S u id o u `` on my la p t op to re fresh myself .
That ' s an ex t re m e ly funny T V cha n n el in J a p an !
We went to there very e ar ly to bu y me r ch and is e , but I could n ' t bu y any because everything I want ed was so l d out : ( I think they ' re very p op ul ar ity .
E ver y on e at / in the conc er t ha ll was ex cited .
B I G B A N G was so close , so I was so surprise d and ha p p y !
I was able to see them up close in person .
I c a n ' t come back to a fact of life . ? ? ?
l o l My ar m s are so re because I was w aving p en light a l ot .
this morning , I knew that B ud w e is er had got ten b ough t out by In b e v two year s a g o .
A t first , I gue s s that L e h man sh ock cause d a bu y o ut .
But , the bu y o ut happen ed on the 1 5 th of J u ly , then L e h man sh ock happen ed on the 1 5 th of S ept e m b er .
A ccord ing to N P R , the st ock B ud own ed were so f e w ( only 4 % ) that they could n ' t keep themselves .
It ' s a p le as ant ly surprise for p ar ent s when they see a new b or n .
As s c i ence keep s im p ro v ing , more and more p re m a ture b a b ies s u v ive with the help of dr u g s , in c u b at or s , o x y g en e t c .
But people may not know that with a p re m a ture body , the b a b y may get N R D S , R O P , N E C and a l ot of compli c ation s .
But you may not ex pe ri ence j o y like that if a d y ing b a b y had not been re s c u ed and gr e w large r .
E I C O who write s b ook s on / about ex er c is es .
He r as s is t ant , M a i , is also a beautiful woman and her smile is so c ut e .
It ' s very us e ful for me because it ' s so easy to do .
I may have a business tri p to C o l or ad o , A m er ic a , and M on t re al , C an ad a .
When I went A m er ic a last s um m er , I had a ch ance to make a present ation to them in English .
But I could n ' t understand what they a d v is ed me to do .
A t the time , I could n ' t say `` I c a n ' t understand what you are talk ing about `` and as k `` C an I as k what you mean ? `` .
I co m m un ic at ed with n at ive speak er s .
C o ul d you speak more s l ow ly with us ing e as i er p h r as es ?
If I can go there , it would be good op p or t un ity to im p ro ve my English .
F or ex amp le I p r a c t ic e s ing ing a so ng for D e ce m b er 2 1 live .
I ' m s ing ing an an im ation so ng and some of my favor ite so ng s .
And I go to E ng l and for next year , so I am p l an n ing for school now .
It ' s very hard , but I think it will be very interest ing to go to E ng l and next year .
I watch ed the mo v i e `` S ha ke s pe ar e in l o ve `` last night .
I like S ha ke s pe ar e ' s story `` R ome o and J ul i e t `` the be st .
Yes ter day ' s mo v i e is about when S ha ke s pe ar e w ro te `` R ome o and J ul i e t `` .
He had a very s ad l o ve
when writing `` R ome o and j ul i e t `` .
T h o se things are de s c ri b ed in this mo ve .
I like this mo v i e and I can study it .
B e c a us e I understand that S ha ke s pe re has R ome o ' s feel ing s .
So S ha ke s pe ar e w ro te a pass ion ate l o ve .
To day is very s un n y day !
It look s very de l ic i ous ,
I ' m work ing as a do c t or , and study ing in a gradua te school of a un ive r s ity in J a p an .
R he um at o l o g y and im m un o l o g y is my f i el d .
I ma in ly c ur e p at i ent s with r he um at o id ar th ri t is or other a ut o im m un e co ll age n dis e as es .
In la b or at or y , I study what the se dis e as es cause and how to treat them .
I do a p p re c i ate your visit ing and c or re c ting my b l o g .
To day , we he l d a works h op at the S en d a i B r an ch .
It took three hour s by S h in k an s en to tra ve l to S en d a i .
To make matter s w or se , [ S P A C E ] it was a one - day business tri p .
It ' s still hot to day .
I went to in ter v i e w at a J a p an e se re st a ur ant .
I have never written an English re s um e , _ so it took a l ot of time .
I ' m wait ing for a re p ly .
B y the way , _ I was very a ng ry at Tokyo G o ver n or S h in ta ro I s h i h ar a !
He said the t s un a m i is re t ri b u tion against J a p an .
How could he say that ? _ _ I c a n ' t believe him !
I will probab ly con t in u e to look for a part - time job tomorrow .
I write my thought s and feel ing s on a N e t w or k No t p ad ,
However , in the next re fresh ,
When I had just finish ed my di ar y , the ne t w or k went down and l los t my not es , o m g !
But more im p or t ant ly is this ,
The p age is close d s ud d en ly !
I started p i an o last S ept e m b er at co m m un ity co ll e g e , and finish ed begin n er ' s class last month .
It was very hard for me to finish this course at the end , since I did n ' t have any ex pe ri ence of play ing p i an o before .
I do n ' t want to have a has s le and he c t ic days any m or e , so de c id ed to take this class just once a week .
And it just started to day .
I will just keep up my p i an o p r a c t ic e for f un .
Yes ter day , my s is ter st ud i ed hard .
She has ex a m s to day .
A n hour after she began to study ma th , she asked .
`` N a o , I could n ' t so l ve this question .
C an you tea ch me ? ``
It ' s very difficult !
But I ' m surprise d that I for g ot this .
And I knew that stuff again .
A no ther was ted day . .
I do nothing ex c ept s ur f the ne t and re st , but I have four ex a m s coming ! ! ! !
S e c on d , the job need s to ful f i ll me since I do n ' t want to feel like I ' m was ting my time just to make money .
I have to be care ful about f i g ur ing out my job and the way to a ch i e ve my dr e a m , because it is not like I ' m very you ng , or like I have many op tion s ( since I do n ' t have enough money ) .
So I will try to do my be st to find my way and a ch i e ve my dr e a m , rather than being f r ust r at ed about my poor sit u ation .
In my last po st , I w ro te about L F s and L R .
A no ther point of view : all kind s ( ty pe s ? ) of re l ation s h i p s are b as ed on it .
B us i ness is b as ed on the will for ma k ing money .
There are many other ex amp le s , but there is one simple conc l us ion - different re l ation s h p may be b as ed on different things , but only co m m un ic ation is mean s for est a b l ish ing a re l ation s h i p .
O ur re l ation s h i p s are b as ed on my l o ve for so f t and f l u f f y and his will to eat .
N a b e is a tra d i tion al dis h in J a p an .
It is very simple c ook ing . .
There are va ri ous f la v or s such as K im ch i ( K or e an ta s te ) , M is o , So y S a u ce , S al t , C ur ry , and so on .
It is es pe c i ally eat en in w in ter because it w ar m s our bo d ies up .
I was look ing for s and al s .
But , even t u ally I could ' t bu y the s and al s that I like d .
I will try to look ing for c ut e s and al s to m m or ow .
To day I w o ke up 3 : 0 0 A M , so that I could enjoy the so c c er game on t v .
H on d a is an honor able J a p an e se .
When I was e le ment ar y school , A L T teacher from A ust r al i a show ed us picture s of A ust r al i an nature , sea , k o al as and so on in his class .
R e c ent ly , J a p an has been de ve l op ing and many bu il d ing s have been bu il t , and we can not see the nature in J a p an because the am o un t of it is de c re as ing .
And I have never go ne a b ro ad and see the scene ry a p ar t from J a p an .
So I saw such a scene ry of picture for the first time and
I thought it looked like a different world .
A fter the class , I want to live in A ust r al i a .
It is g en er ally believe d that ( the ) J a p an e se ( language ) does n ' t have ar t ic le s .
To day I will re v i e w about the us age of ar t ic le s .
* I visit ed a town which is f a m ous for being a hot sp r ing re s or t .
The town in this sen t ence is one of s ever al f a m ous town s .
In this case , this is the only f a m ous town that ex is t s ( in the re g ion ) .
In addition , the w or d `` ar t ic le `` it s el f is p u z z ling too .
When ever I see this w or d , I think of a new s p a p er ar t ic le .
U n f or t un ate ly , I have n ' t finish ed all of my work l o ad this week .
So I ' ll be for c ed to be on d ut y tomorrow .
I apologize to you for the short not ic e
To day is the day that J a p an los t the w ar against A m er ic a .
On 1 5 , A u g ust , 1 94 5 , J a p an los t the w ar against A m er ic a .
I know it was fool ish of J a p an to fight against A m er ic a .
We could not w in against A m er ic a because our te ch no l o g y was poor .
We must a c k n ow led g e our f a il ur e : we los t the w ar .
But I believe we f a il ed in another way , too .
A fter the w ar , we s u c ce ed ed in str e ng th en ing the e c on o m y and ga in ing better living stand ar d s .
We long ed for We s ter n life and our c ul ture was We s ter n i z ed .
But now we have los t our J a p an e se I D E N T I T Y and C U L T U R E .
You can im a g in e what I mean by J a p an e se c ul ture .
O f course , Ka b u k i , W a k a , S a m ur a i , Ya m at o , W a b i S a b i and so on .
But mo d er n J a p an e se people do n ' t watch Ka b u k i , s ing W a k a and H a i ku , or watch S a m ur a i .
No w a day s , our life s ty le is We s ten i z ed : we have los t J a p an e se c ul ture .
We are not J a p an e se . M or e p re c is e ly , we are not what we us ed to be .
In ' The L a st S a m ur a i ' , which star s To m C r u is e , this idea is the sub j e c t .
A f t r er the w ar , we s u c ce ed ed e c on o m ic ally , but we los t our c ul ture .
O ur e c on o m y is not strong any m or e .
I believe this is the be st ch ance for J a p an e se people to re g a in our id ent ity and c ul ture and to work to g e ther .
It ' s go r g e ous .
Even though I b ough t it only 5 0 0 yen ( about $ 5 ) ,
I c a n ' t believe it s p ri ce is only a small am o un t .
In my opinion , f a m ous F re n ch w in e or something of the like is not e qu al to it s co st s .
I think their va l u e does not just if y the s el ling p ri ce .
I l o ve A ust r al i an & A m er ic an w in e too . There are a number of good w in es that I ' m c a p able of bu y ing , give n I do n ' t have too much money since I ' m so you ng .
He y , please can any on e tell me how good F re n ch w in e is !
I usual ly listen to the English con ver s ation pro g r a m or watch English T V dr a m a with P S P ( P S P stand s for P la y S t ation P or t able ) on the train .
I went to C o st c o with my friend s a f e w days before .
My friend re c o m m en d ed C he er i o s to me .
And I found out something wonder ful when I went to pay for the ce re al :
ch o c o l ate ch un k ( c ook ies ? ) .
It was similar to the c ook ies made by my ( ? ) teachers .
I l o ve my teachers ' hand m ad e c ook ies .
I ta st ed them at the C h ri st m as b a ke s al e at my high school .
T e a ch er s made c ook ies and so l d them .
t u i tion .
I p ic k ed up my hu s b and this morning .
I thought it would be easy to get there , because to day is S at ur day .
But there was a l ot of tra f f ic , , , , I ha te tra f f ic .
A fter l un ch , I went to the off ic i al kid s play g r ound but it was close d , too bad .
So I play ed with my sweet d aught er in front of my house .
We take a walk a little , then I heard do g ' s b ar k .
and I saw a bo y , stand ing be s id e the water way .
I could not believe my eyes .
There was a do g , that was very old and s k in n y .
I was hold ing my da u g ter so I could not help .
I called out to my hu s b and to help the do g .
S ud d en ly one man came and help ed .
He p ic k ed up the do g but the do g f e ll through his f ing er s again .
He p ic k ed it up again and took it to some house in the dis t ance .
I do not know what happen ed after w ar d s .
I ho pe to the do g can be re un it ed with it s own er back at his ( her ) house .
H i guy s ,
My name is N ic k y . I ' m T a i w an e se , 2 3 year s old , and I want to le ar n some English . P le a se c or re c t my English and tea ch me about anything I have written in c or re c t ly in my j o ur n al s ! T h an k s ! A l s o , if any on e want s to le ar n some C h in e se you could tell me ; I will ing to help .
If any on e like s hi p - ho p m us ic or c ul ture , i p h on es , tra ve ling , night c l u b s , e t c .
, we can be good friend s ! P le a se leave your me s s age and some commen t s . I a p p re c i ate it ! ! !
There ' s some funny things happen ing in my life ~
A c t ur ally , I sat on the floor all night to write this b l o g . I w ro te the di ar y and as k friend how to tra n s l ate it into English . ~ * * ~ It make s me s c at ter ed ~ p h r as es like `` bu st ling street `` or `` p re s s the bu s be ll `` .
@ @ I also change d job s .
I for g ot if I w ro te that on my last es s a y or not ? ?
My job is not so great .
There are too many st or es near b y .
There is a go l d access or ies st or e next to my st or e and op po s ite to B o o st .
It ' s a good in a way that B o o st is next to my st or e , so that some c ust ome r s go to see my pro d u c t s when they are wait ing for dr in k s or friend s .
O r some c ust ome r s might say something that mean s they want to have a dis c o un t .
And that kind of sit u ation is just like business in the mar ke t in my country .
I never think that will happen in other co un t ri es , es pe c i ally in the w h ite people ' s world .
In my opinion , they of ten bu y pro d u c t s in st or es direct ly and they do n ' t b ar g a in .
B ar g a in ing is too ti r ing for me ~ X D
In the end , I will work hard to do my job .
My friend told me there is another job with more money to e ar n ! ! ! ~ ^ ^ ~ Y A ~
In a di al o gue I st ud i ed the other day , there was a sen t ence `` why , than k you . `` Some on e prais ed a dress that one woman was we ar ing .
I heard it for the first time and felt it sound ed strange .
It ' s se c re t for now .
A c t u ally , I want to work and e ar n money ,
because I have a l ot of things that I want to do and want to bu y .
So to day I will go to an in ter v i e w .
P ro b ably , you know of it .
I have been want ing to get a s ing le - l en s re f le x came r a for a long time .
D re a m ing about the future is interest ing .
P le a se c he er me on !
A l th ough no one c or re c ted my di ar y , I c or re c ted some on e ' s J a p an e se .
This is my first ent ry on L an g - 8 .
I do n ' t even know what to write .
I ' m a 2 4 - year - old girl , b or n and raise d in a ti n y sub ur b town in J a p an .
I live d with my family ti ll 1 9 and left to the state s to study what ever .
I was look ing down on all the ty p ical co ll e g e kid s in J a p an when I was 1 8 I gue s s .
so u ve n ir . .
N e x t month , I ' ll go to school in B o st on for two week s to study English , and visit N e w Y or k for 4 days for sight se e ing .
I want to b r ing so u ve n ir s for my ho st f a m il ies .
I happen ed to not ic e the so ng `` do n ' t know why `` s un g by No r a h J on es was also s un g by an English s ing er name d J on i K e en .
I felt there was a dis t in c t di f f er ence between No r a h J on es and J on i K e en while I was listen ing to it .
E s pe c i ally the me l o d y of the p i an o , it is enough to get my b a b y e re c t .
I tri ed to look for the U R L that con tain s this so ng so all of you read ing my ar t ic le could listen to it ,
but it ' s hard to look for .
if you w an n a listen to this so ng , sen d me a request to sen d it by e m a il .
Yes , the ti t le of my not e is b an al , but I can not in v ent anything better .
F ir st , I want to tell you some g en er al fact s about me .
I ` m a r us s i an girl who live in the so u th of R us s i a , in the re g ion of K r as no d ar , in the small town of K ro po t k in .
I play g u it ar , watch an im e ( y es , I ` m one of _ them _ > _ > ) , and le ar n English .
I want to become an O ri ent al is t one day .
So I must pass an / the English ex a m , but my know led g e of stand ar d English is not very high .
And what more can I tell you ?
I can not think of anything else now .
D id I make some mistake s in this te x t ? *
It ta st ed good ex c ept for the s te w
The view po in t of speak er is that all f a c ul ty should work outside the un ive r s ity in a pro f es s ion re le v ant to the course s they tea ch .
On one hand , p rofessor s who work outside will know which te ch no l o g y is more us e ful in fact u al pro j e c t s .
There are so many the or ies in one a c ad e m ic f i el d . F or ex amp le , in so f t w ar e e ng in e er ing , both J a v a and C + + are very us e ful pro g r a m m ing language s .
P rofessor s should p ic k one language to tea ch to give the students a better understand ing of the ma ter i al .
In C h in a , C + + is us ed more f re qu ent ly than J a v a ; con se qu ent ly , teachers should pay more at ten tion to C + + .
S t ud ent s who le ar n more us e ful te ch no l o g y will have a big a d v ant age in find ing a job .
In addition , work ing outside will give p rofessor s a better understand ing of their own f i el d .
In some circumstance s , the or ies in te x t b ook s are no us e in re al life .
However , a p rofessor who has that ex pe ri ence may not agree if the f aster one co st s too much more than the other .
The teaching s of each of the se teachers will di f f er great ly , and the l at ter is more us e ful to students .
N ever th e less , not all course s are st ud i ed for p r a c t ical us e , such as al g e b r a ; one might not find a job b as ed so le ly on ma th .
M or e o ver , it is better st ud i ed on c amp us , in a la b , not in a comp an y ,
because there may not be a pro j e c t to us e it direct ly .
As a re s ul t , the se p rofessor s should not was te time find ing job s .
As B er t u ar d R us se ll said , `` E x pe ri ence without le ar n ing is better than le ar ing without ex pe ri ence . ``
E ver y p rofessor in a f i el d that off er s the op p or t un ity to work outside , should ; the other s may stay on c amp us .
F or students ' future s , un ive r s it ies should find more op p or t un it ies to give their p rofessor s .
In that way , both p rofessor s ' and students ' c a p a c it ies will im p ro ve .
I ' ve f in ally finish ed all my work for the week to day .
A l th ough I ' m ex ha ust ed and sleep y , I ' m look ing for w ar d to going to my n i e ce ' s b ir th day part y tomorrow .
But before the part y , I ' ll try to get p l ent y of sleep .
H i , my name ' s M ar c o .
I am from I ta ly and I ' m 1 7 year s old .
It ' s ha p p y day to day because G o o g le B l o g g er is back !

I do n ' t want any m or e pro ble m s , G o o g le : (

And I am work ing in comp an y that is l o c at ed close to O s a k a T en man g u ( a S h in t o S h ri ne in O s a k a ) .
How does the J a p an e se a c c ent sound ?
J a p an e se people ten d to have a strong a c c ent , but that see m s to be o k a y for girl s , because it some h ow sound s c ut e .
But what about guy s ?
As i an C up to night
The world may not care for this , but there is a big game on to night .
It is a f o ot b a ll game f in al between J a p an and A ust r al i a .
I wonder why the A us s ies are in As i a .
Well , it ' s O K because we ' ve got more good tea m s in the As i an C up .
They are big and strong . A l s o many of them play a b ro ad .
O k a y , I ' ll have to stop writing this .
Yes , I ' m th in - s k in ed .
The C h in e se M ir We i , 43 year s old , was up se t with a police a ction in He ch i , C h in a , and pro t est ed get ting n a k ed and c l im b ing over a high ten s ion w i re .

P le a se , any on e who can speak English even a little , a d d me .
I want to p r a c t ic e English by writing and cha t ting more with you at face b ook .
And any on e who want s to le ar n T ha i or has a question about it , you can feel free to as k me but you have to us e English at an in ter m ed i ate le ve l because I can only us e this , or if you are good at T ha i and w an n a talk with me in T ha i , that ' s o k .

I do n ' t have anything s ch ed ul ed to day .
I went to N a g a o k a k y o c ity in K y ot o to day .
The purpose was bu y ing f a m ous b a k ed p or k .
When I watch ed a T V pro g r a m , I knew the st or e .

However , yesterday , when I b r ow s ed the in ter ne t , I found a

`` S or ry , we are close d unti l A p ri l for re ne w al . ``
I can not be here in K y ot o in A p ri l because of my job .
I want to go some where on this ho l i day .
But , I have nothing s ch ed ul ed to day .
I know that I have to study English and other things .
I am writing my first di ar y ent ry now .
To day , I play ed the f l ut e at school .
I had b re a k f a st and I went to school .
I like the me m b er s of my bra s s b and !
F ir st of all , the di f f er ence of tra f f ic r ul es between U S and J a p an is .
I felt the ro ad s are not p a v ed well comp ar ed to J a p an .
F in ally , is the dr i v ing manner s .
I than k ed G o d for my ar ri v al to the hotel without any a c c id ent .
I b re at he de e p ly to let the so o th ing s c ent of we t e ar th into my l un g s along with the rather co l d and we t b re e z e that to u ch es my face .
My hand s get co l d before other ' s hand s do , usual ly .
The ro t ting board s are ma k ing their f in al attempt to hold each other .
F ro m between them a big ga r d en could be see n , many w il d p l ant s are living with the ga r d en tree s now , which I do n ' t suppose was all ow ed when hu man s were living here .
This c r ow d ed ga r d en is that ta ll est p in e tree ' s b ir th p la ce .
N as r in point s to some c r ow s s ing ing and da n c ing to g e ther over a p is ta ch i o tree in the night dress es they always we ar .
W o n ' t we be all so s ad if we do n ' t he ar the c r ow s ' me s s age of the start of a new sea s on ?
To day I ' ll tell you about my s ch ed ul ed tri p to Tokyo .
So I ' ll leave him to let him sleep well that night .
We ' ll enjoy N a k a m is e street , a p ed est ri an ma ll le ad ing to S en s o - j i T e m p le from the Ka m in ar i - mo n .
We ' ll find many small sh op s which se ll tra d i tion al J a p an e se it e m s and f o o d , line d up on both side s of the street .
I went to p re p ar e for `` Y o m is e `` this morning .
To day it w as very hot and hu m id .
I w or ri ed about get ting a he at str o ke .
I was very tired because of the he at .
This picture is of `` C ha m us um e `` who as s is ted in s er v ing co l d gr e en tea last year .
Yes ter day there was a T V pro g r a m on A l - J a z e er a h - C h il d re n cha n n el , in each e p is o d e of this pro g r a m they ho st a ch il d or te en age r and let him live his dr e a m job , and me e t some on e works in the same job .
In yesterday s e p is o d e , they ho st ed a girl , that / who can speak A r a b ic and F re n ch . he dr e a m s to work as an `` In ter p re ter `` . She me t some on e who works as an `` In ter p re ter `` ; a person who tra n s l ate s from one language to other in st ant ly . This person works for the United N ation s and tra n s l ate s speech es in the s es s ion s .
They show how this job is very difficult , because the in ter p re ter should listen , think of the mean ing , speak and listen to the next sen t ence at the same time without any mistake s .
They also show how this in ter p re ter c a n ' t work for more than 3 0 minute s , because this job need s a l ot of conc ent r ation , and he should have a re st every half hour .
The girl did a great job in translation , and I think she would be a good in ter p re ter in the future .
To day it is S at ur day , D e ce m b er 1 1 .
I ' ll make myself b re a k f a st now .
I ' m going to make to a st , a f ri ed e g g and p ot at o s al ad .
My two ch il d re n like to c r a c k an eggs he ll , but they some time s f a il and make a me s s .
It ' s just 1 0 days this year .
R e c ent ly , I ' m ( ma k ing ) a N e w Y e ar ' s c ar d de s i g n .
But , I could n ' t think of a n ic e de s i g n .
B e c a us e , next year is the ti g er in C h in e se as t ro l o g y .
B y the way , I heard new year is different in some co un t ri es .
' s ( J a p an ' s ) new year is on J an u ar y .
( C h in e se ) new year is on F e b r u ar y .
In d i an and B an g la d es h i new year are on A p ri l .
When is the coming of a new year in your country ?
T h r ough writing it , I found out that one of the name ' s or i g in s is re la ted to the name of the job .
To day , I work ed on my gradua tion re p or t .
I read some ar t ic le s to get us e ful i nformation .
I think `` The N ame `` has some effect on people ' s live s .
So I ' m going to name my future so n . . .
I watch ed the re st of `` 2 4 sea s on 6 `` .
I ' ll be able to catch up to the l ate st sea s on with in this year .
In that dr a m a , many short respon se s are us ed re pe at ed ly in con ver s ation .
However , some p h r as es are very co m m on in da i ly con ver s ation , such as the p h r as es the c i v il i an s us e in con ver s ation s before being in v o l v ed in a c ri m e , the p h r as es us ed in the meeting s in the W h ite H ous e , and so on .
I heard the p h r a se , `` What are you talk ing about ? `` in many scene s .
So I have been st u c k at home .
It will be co l d for the next three days .
I will stay at home each of the se days with a b ook to read .
O ur de p ar t ment will hold a dr in k ing part y to day .
I ' m a light dr in k er and I do n ' t like al c o h o l .
So , I do n ' t like a dr in k ing part y very much .
I le ar n ed some w or d s and express ion s yesterday and I ' ll try to write some short sen t ence s .
( 1 ) I went out with an um b re ll a this morning because the we a ther for e c a st said that there would be the ch ance of show er s in the even ing .
( 3 ) To pro ve that the machi ne did n ' t have any de f e c t s , the e ng in e er brought it to a ha l t for three days and c he c k ed it thoroughly .
( 5 ) W h o could ant ic i p ate an in c re a se in e mission of po ll ut ant s .
( 6 ) You are el i g i ble for get ting a sp e c i al dis c o un t provide d you b r ing the c ar d we sen t last week .
Well , I ' ll try to write a di ar y con tain ing more w or d s than the T w it ter ' s character limit .
F or English follow er s , my T w it ter I D is `` a k ar i 1 3 1 `` . .
It ' s `` k un i p en `` .
If you find me on T w it ter , please follow me .
To day I w o ke up with a smile .
To day I had b re a k f a st with a sp o on .
To day I took a bath with so a p .
To day I went out with my p ar ent s , then had dinner with them .
To day I am very ha p p y .
R e c ent ly I saw this .
A c t u ally So u th K or e an people usual ly are n ' t interest ed about / in No r th K or e a .
O f course , some people in / from N G O s , hu man right s or g an i z ation s & ch ur ch es are conc er n ed about No r th K or e a .
act u ally I did n ' t know about my b l o o d re l at ive s before I saw it .
I do n ' t think that the mo v i e tell s us everything .
that ' s going too far , to say the least . . .
The story is about a No r th K or e an man .
He had a family : a w if e and a kid .
One day his w if e was sick , but the man could n ' t find me d ic in e .
They just had just a little c or n f l o ur and his w if e was d y ing .
So , he de c id ed to go to C h in a and go back to No r th K or e a after find ing some me d ic in e .
The next ( part of the ) story is . .
the con t ent s are good .
it ' s a very s ad story .
the g l o b al new s said to us ,
And the mo v i e story is just one among many other s .
I c ri ed a f e w time s when ( while ) I was watch ing the mo v i e .
T h in k ing that if I was the man who had a sick w if e but could n ' t find the me d ic in e and the f o o d was de c re as ing . . .
No r th K or e a and C h in a are very friend ly
But , if a No r th K or e an person is de te c ted by the police of C h in a or No r th K or e a cross ing the b or d er , 8 of 1 0 are k il led .
by the go ver ment .
Even though people try to es c a pe from No r th K or e a . . .
They ri s k everything because they just want to live .
B i g S al e
I want ed a s um m er j a c ke t so my w if e and I went to a big s al e .
I ch o se from many j a c ke t s . F in ally , I b ough t two j a c ke t s .
One was a n a v y b l u e and the other was a c he c k er ed .
I like d the se so much .
My w if e got many c l o th es which she like s .
We had f un sh op p ing to day .
L a st week I went on a business tri p to L on d on .
It was s n ow ing .
D ur ing my business tri p , I visit ed the T ate M o d er n and I b ough t a T - shirt .
Some person s said that B ri tain f o o d is not ta s ty .
However I do n ' t think so .
In Tokyo I have found a l ot of matter s by the To h o ku Ka n t o serious dis aster .
1 , we can s a ve e le c t ri c ity , there f or e we had sp en d much p ow er . ( F or ex amp le , people of the same family can work in the same room so that they can s a ve en er g y . )
2 , I have got ch ance s to help my family , and co m m un ic at ing with my family has gr ow n much more than ever before .
3 , I found that my person al se c ur ity I have to pro te c t my myself , but I should co op er ate people
4 , A l ot of i nformation has con f us ed us , thus I always have to think what I need im p or t ant i nformation .
5 , I ` m more act ive , because G o d help ed us .
So I think I will face many big pro ble m s in the future , but I believe I can over c ome them .
No w , I ` m conc er n ed about the water pro ble m : water in the Ka n t o re g ion has gradua l ly become con ta m in at ed by F u ku s h im a D a i i ch i N P P .
Tokyo and some re g ion s are s a f e .
The C l im b
The so ng make me re m e m b er my life , my f a i th is sha k ing , feel s los t with no direction .
`` But I got ta keep try ing .
H a ve I told you th at I keep a c at ?
It ' s re ally c ut e , show it to you , my friend .
It ' s very hu m id to day . There is no w in d and I want to do nothing
My s k in is st ic k y all over .
I can ' t wait !
To night is going to be a big night for J a p an .
I c a n ' t wait to watch that , either ! !
I ' m look ing for w ar d to that .
I am w or ri ed about ma k ing friend s .
I ' ll always smile tomorrow : )
E ver y th ing will be O K !
My p rofessor asked us to go to a f e w writing works h op s and she would give us ex t r a 5 point s for every works h op we at ten d .
B e c us e I had another a p po in t ment that finish ed at the same time as the works h op started .
R e c ent ly , I ' ve been very bu s y , I have n ' t written a di ar y . . . . . .
In a f e w days , I will have a t est .
And now I want some on e who can tea ch me English .
I know C ant on e se , I can tea ch other s speak C ant on e se .
W at ch ing the M o v i e `` R E D ``
To day I watch ed the mo v i e `` R E D `` star r ing B r u ce W i ll is .
I understood R E D as re d at first , but R E D re ally stand s for R e t ir ed Even D an g er ous .
In other w or d s , R E D re p re s ent s ex - C I A a g ent s who are still da ng er ous .
The mo v i e star s B r u ce W i ll is who never dis a p po in t s me .
R E D was re ally ex c it ing .
When I was a te en age r in high s ch o o l I like d ho r r or mo v ies .
As time go es by , I think my person al ity has change d .
I w an n a tell the character a c r u c i al thing .
There are many character s like the one a b o ve : Ka r a age K un and character s for s te ame d me at bu n s , al t ough all of them are not a w ar e of their c ri t ical circumstance s .
I of ten sit in front of the comp ut er all day long so there is a big pro ble m for my eyes .
There is a new pro d u c t , the K in d le , which will probab ly so l ve my pro ble m .
You can hold it just like a re al b ook , and the s c re en look s like the p age of a b ook , too .
It co st s over $ 2 0 0 though .
That is too ex p en s ive .
J ust like normal , I sp ent s ever al hour s work ing as a re ce p tion is t , and then at mi d night I looked around to see if something had go ne wrong .
On the S e c on d F l o or , it s ud d en ly got dark er than before !
When I a p p ro a ch ed the op er at ing room , I heard
s c ar ed upon he ar ing this and I quick ly ra n away from the place .
But the voice came after me as if it was tell ing me something im p or t ant
The next day , I heard from some on e that the voice was that of a de ce as ed old lady who di ed from a ter m in al i ll ness .
A fter she had an op er ation , she quick ly di ed .
I should c or re c t myself ; I probab ly dr e a m every night but I only think I had a dr e a m when I re m e m b er it .
I must say is that many time s what I live in the dr e a m is con ne c ted with my re al life , with my w or ri es .
M a y b e I ' m not a person with a l ot of f ant as y !
I do n ' t believe much in the in ter p re t ation of dr e a m s because nothing ex t re m e ly strange happen s . . . .
But , in the last one , I first dr e a m t I was in f la ting a bu n ch of b a ll o on s . . .
Then I re m e m b er ed I dr e a m t of mi ce in my room .
When I w o ke up next day I was in a da z e .
M ic e ? !
In my room ? !
It was the first time I dr e a m t about an im al s .
I sea r ch ed on G o o g le and the mean ing was n ' t so po s it ive .
So , regard less of what your re l i g ion is , every on e is ha p p y to say `` M er ry C h ri st m as ! ``
When you us e water at a bath ro o m , do you us e a l ever from a f a u ce t to turn it into a show er ?
In J a p an we usual ly s w it ch how to run water by turn ing a l ever .
I usual ly us e a f a u ce t in s te ad of a show er
to was h hand s , face and so on .
On ly when I am tak ing a show er , I us e the a p p l i ance .
B e c a us e of this , I may have a ter ri ble a c c id ent if I ever for g e t to & n b s p ; return the l ever after us ing a show er .
You might s ud d en ly take a co l d show er at the n a pe of your ne c k .
It ' s enough to r u in your day .
H a ve you ever had this so r t of a c c id ent ?
T en ex t r a hand s would have been very we l c ome . .
I ' m going to L on d on in about 1 0 hour s on a school tri p , y e a h !
And still , I have this e er i e idea I for g ot about something . . .
My friend s will come along with me .
O ur you th ho st el is sit u at ed two hour s from L on d on , so I ' ll eat a l ot in my b or ed o m .
And my be st friend is quite sen s it ive to s u g ar , in the sen se she get s re ally , re ally h y p er and g i g g ly .
Then she g i g g le s about very s il ly things . . .
E m i le R ate l b and is nothing comp ar ed to her f it s of laugh ter !
not e : E m i le R ate l b and is a very h y p er mo t i v ation al train er , who always y e ll s ' ' T s j a k a ! ' ' .
X D I think he ' d dr ive me c r a z y if he talk ed to me for five minute s .
So six c r a z y girl s po l ish ing off a l ot of s u g ar and ch o c o l ate is the per f e c t re c i pe to be in st it ch es , have a co up le of girl s who are fool ing around and have a l ot of cha t ter , cha t ter and cha t ter !
This mean s I probab ly w o n ' t get a ch ance to than k you all for your commen t s , c or re ction s or s up p or t .
The L a st D a y in 2 0 0 9
To day is the last day in 2 0 0 9 , but I still need to take a class , while some of my friend s s k i p p ed class es yesterday to go home and p re p ar e co un t d ow n act i v it ies .
In T a i w an , before the `` co un t d ow n , `` almost every co un ty and c ity will have big act i v it ies . P e op le will ga ther to watch s ing ing perform ance s .
The most f un part of the co un t d ow n must be the f i re w or k perform ance .
A m on g all the f i re w or k perform ance s in T a i w an , T a i pe i 1 0 1 is the most f a m ous because T a i pe i 1 0 1 is the high est bu il d ing in the world .
A fter the co un t d ow n , the f i re w or k perform ance will last 1 8 8 second s .
When in ve st ing in the st ock mar ke t , we as s m u e that the c r ow d s would be at t r a c ted by the out st and ing comp an ies as time go es by .
A m er ic an I d o l , a T V pro g r a m , is an good ex amp le .
The good new s is the w is d o m of c r ow d s act u ally ex is t s .
F or ex amp le , when est im at ing the number of b a ll s in a j ar or the m ur d er ra te in N e w Y or k c ity , the er r or s between the c r ow d s always be c ance ll ed out by each other so that the a ver age answer is of ten s ur p ri s ing ly a c c ur ate .
On the another hand , the bad new s is the w is d o m of c r ow d s is a p h en ome n on which is too we a k to be believe d .
The di f f er ence between a s m ar t c r ow d and a b l in d c r ow d may be very small .
The w or se thing is that the con ne c ted ness of mo d er n life may make it more difficult to get the be n if it of the w is d o m of c r ow d s , a ccord ing to the new re se ar ch by some S w is s s c i ent is t s .
I watch ed high school m us ic la at first , it ' s very interest ed and p ow er ful .
No w a day s , I f re qu ent ly feel sleep y in the day time .
To day , I near ly s l ept in the mi d st of do ing work .
L a c k of sleep has bad effect s on the body , es pe c i ally on bra in .
My p ar ent s have already di ed , so I live in my a un t ' s home now .
But I ' ll have to go back to my own home unti l I go to the U S A .
There is no one here . . .
It ' s only for a short time , but I may get l on e ly .
I have live d alone for s ever al year s .
But I feel different when I live alone in the house where I was b or n .
It is s ty l ish and has a good de s i g n .
I ' m having difficult y when I us e it , however I take pleasure in us ing it .
A success ful law s u it against n ation and P h ar m a ce ut ical C o m p an y .
The p la in t if f ( p at i ent s ) was success in the law s u it against n ation and p h r m a ce ut ical comp an y .
P e op le who work in the p h ar m a ce ut ical in d ust ry , must be act ive in dis c l o s ing i nformation for me d ical s ta f f and p at i ent s .
My friend , who se pe t name is S un n y b o y , invite d me to str o ll around the street s with him yesterday at 4 P M .
He want ed to sen d a girl who he has had a c r us h on a p ur se , which has an ex qu is ite f i g ur e i ll ust r at ed in world ma p .
I or d er ed the but ter and b a c on past a , as k ing the wait re s s if the c he f could o m it the b a c on for me for I am a ve g e ta ri an .
F in ally , we went to a sp or t s play g r ound that has many in d o or sp or t am en it ies includ ing b a se b a ll , b as ke t b a ll , and so c c er .
He re in T a i w an , it ' s p re v al ent to play in d o or b a se b a ll , it co st only $ 1 U S .
The p it ch ing machi ne will p it ch 3 0 b a ll s in turn , who se sp e ed can be ch o s en , and the play er s just take a b at to s w ing .
f m `` , but I could n ' t write for re c ent days .
One of the reason is that I do n ' t know if my English is c or re c t or not .
If your di ar y is written in J a p an e se , I can c he c k your J a p an e se ! !
My town has a l o c al free ma g a z in e called `` E x p l or er `` .
It ' s very us e ful because it has an even t s ch ed ul e for my town as well as some re st a ur ant v o u ch er s .
It ' s p u b l ish ed every month , and it can be found in the sh op p ing ma ll , in re st a ur ant s and so on .
If your town has a free ma g a z in e , you should get it .
I ' m not sure whether I will con t in u e work ing for my c ur r ent comp an y , but I am sure that I will keep work ing unti l I am 4 5 year s old .
I d e ally , I would like to mo ve to another comp an y which off er s better condition s ; un f or t un ate ly , as a p ar ent who is tak ing care of a you ng ch il d , I have limit ed op tion s .
The great est difficult y is that my p ar ent s live so far away , so that they c a n ' t care my ch il d for me .
C ur r ent ly I ' m hi r ing a b a b y s it ter to take care of my ch il d while I am at work , but some time s I feel sorry not to care of her myself .
I c a n ' t p re ten d to her that I am ha p p y when she c ri es and as k s me not to go to work .
Even so , the reason I de c id ed to con t in u e work ing is to se c ur e a better future .
I ho pe to have better house , e ar n more money , provide my ch il d with a good education , bu y what I want and go for a tri p . . .
I thought I did n ' t want big things ; however , it was n ' t tru e .
A t first , I started le ar n ing English to get a better care er , but now a day s I just like talk ing about what ever happen s around me in English because there are some people who have w ar m conc er n s and provide kind c or re ction s .
B o th in K or e an and in English , I always write things in a comp le x way .
This week is going to be hard because I at ten d ed a re l at ive ' s w ed d ing over the week en d so I did n ' t get any re st .
I re ally want to have a good day ' s re st .
I do n ' t have the time . . .
I went to school and me t my friend s .
A fter school I work ed part time .
L e ar n ing English from mo v ies ?
It ' s been a long time since I watch ed a we s ter n mo v i e .
but are n ' t the character s too ex a g g er at ed when speak ing ?
I mean the w or d s , v o c a b ul ar y , and way of speak ing in the mo v ies ,
S in ce they ' re ma k ing a mo v i e , some time s they are more e m o tion al when act ing , includ ing speak ing .
If I le ar n how to speak English from mo v ies , would it be a p p ro p ri ate ?
I ' m a first year st ud ent on m aster ' s de g re e in S I T un ive r s ity .
I re se ar ch in the L a b from morning to even ing on week day s .
But I have a part - time job on S at ur day and S un day .
I work as a w ed d ing as s is t ant .
I want to get mar ri ed one day .
To day , I just sp ent my time re st ing .
I will probab ly go to S e o ul on S at ur day because it will be one of my be st friend s ' b ir th day .
It is a ce le b r ation s for my friend !
And then my s ch ed ul e will be change .
I just look for a go al .
It c he er s me up for my life and I believe that = )
The old er we become , the short er we feel a pass ing year .
I think that the le ng th of a year is pro p or tion ate to our di m in ish ing year s .
F or ex amp le , since I ' m 2 6 year s old , a year pro p or tion ate to my age would be 1 / 2 6 .
On the other hand , for an el d er ly person who is 8 0 year s old , a year pro p or tion ate to his age would be 1 / 8 0 .
I think that the el d er ly person would feel that a year is short er as comp ar ed to me in the this case .
To day I was very tired because I work ed a long time .
I will ex er c is e in a near by p ar k when I go back home .
I must do many things .
I am having a hard day .
It has been ra in ing to day .
I went to the b ook st or e to bu y some b ook s .
I am interest ed in p ow er stone s ^ ^
I c he c k ed my b ir th st on e and I am going to bu y my own p ow er stone .
What are you interest ed in ?
I ' m more like ly to have an or al ul c er , and I have two or al ul c er s now .
One is on my to n gue , the other is near the corner of my l ow er l i p .
When I begin to speak or eat something , I have a ter ri ble pai n there .
But I l o ve speak ing and eat ing !
A ccord ing to w i k i p ed i a , a p ic k y eat er , person under str es s or with a f o o d all er g y is p r ed is po s ed to have a or al ul c er .
I ' m not a p ic k y eat er , and many people say that it see m s I hard ly feel str es s .
I s this cause of the or al ul c er s ?
A n y way , I ho pe to get c ur ed soon !
L on g , long a g o there was a bo y who l o ve you for so long .
But with the s te p s of the w in d , all things have go ne .
How long have I wait ed to see you again .
But at the end of the f a ir y ta le , you even t u ally said `` by e - by e `` .
My English ability is g g e t ting w or se and w or se .
When I want to talk in English , I will think in J a p an e se un c on s c i ous ly .
It ' s so strange !
I have le ar n ed English since j un i or high school , but have le ar n ed J a p an e se for just two year s .
To C h in e se people , J a p an e se w or d s are e as i er than English w or d s .
In addition , in my co ll e g e , my ma j or is J a p an e se .
I us e it every day , and in most class es .
O ur teachers are str ic t .
I want to im p ro ve my English ability .
M a y b e read ing an English ar t ic le every day ?
To be more ex a c t , I had my father bu y me a s n ow b o ar d as my b ir th day present .
I went to Ka n d a , Tokyo with my father some days a g o .
There was a town full of sp or ting good s and us ed b ook s .
There were many sp or t s comp an y bu il d ing s and a l ot of small sh op s .
It is No ve m b er and w in ter will soon come !
So many sh op s se ll s n ow b o ar d s and s n ow b o ar d ing we ar .
We went in the sh op s and looked at the many board s .
I asked the c l er k which board is good f un ction for me and good on me .
My he i g h t is 1 6 5 c m , so I should us e a board about 1 4 5 - 1 5 5 c m s . long .
I went back to one of the sh op s .
I found my favor ite de s i g n .
I looked at the under s id e of the board .
I , of course , looked at the p ri ce ta g .
A t last , I found a good board .
I took it .
When I said that paper b a c k b ook s in the U S were too ex p en s ive , my A m er ic an friend said to me `` tell me about it ``
I did n ' t ex a c t ly know what that mean t .
But it mean s something like , `` I agree with you `` , or `` I already know that , I think so ``
I came back to J a p an yesterday and went to my p ar ent s ' house in O s a k a .
I have not written any ent ri es , in the last past f e w days , because I was n ' t able to us e the in ter ne t in a hotel .
F ir st , we went to the L on e P in e K o al a S an c t u ar y .
We were able to see many f a m ous kind s of an im al s in A ust r al i a such as k o al as , k an g ar o o s , w o m b at s , and so on .
In particular , my d aught er was ha p p y to fee d the k an g ar o o s .
On the second day , we went to M or e t on I s l and .
M or t on I s l and is the big g est is l and made of s and s in the world so it has many de s er t s .
we also enjoy ed s w im m ing in the sea , eat ing many kind s of dis he s which were p op ul ar in A ust r al i a .
What we will never for g e t is that we was able to fee d the w il d do l p h in s direct ly .
Why do the se people go c r a z y for C G ?
G o o d morning .
I p l an to go sh op p ing at R i g h t - On to day .
ma x im um : You need to pay ma x im um at ten tion when you us e ga s o line .
mi n im um : I think his im m ed i ate a ction kept the da m age mi n im um . ( just mi n im um see m s w i er d . . .
me re : I want to know the who le tru th , not just a me re p or tion .
e m p ty : When I visit ed her house , there was no one inside , and the room was e m p ty .
va c ant : I could n ' t find a va c ant sea t when I took the train . ( took a train ? )
I was p l an n ing to take an in ten s ive class on teaching J a p an e se d ur ing the s um m er .
So , if I could take the class , I could become c er t if i ed as a J a p an e se teacher .
When I heard about that , I was so so so so sh ock ed !
But , there ' s nothing I can do about that .
I have to wait unti l the next ch ance or just for g e t about it I gue s s .
I always think about my future but never find a good idea .
On each s ta ll called `` G o ten - Ya ta i `` , the girl s have on co l or ful co st um es and are play ing m us ic called `` O ha y ash i `` .
They all are s ing ing `` Ka b u k i - B a y ash i `` same with the m us ic which is s an g in `` Ka b u k i `` .
W ome n are sit ting at the behind the girl s and are play ing `` S ha m is en `` and `` H u - e `` f l ut es .
A ll of the people on the s ta ll s are w ome n and girl s because `` G e ish a `` were play ing `` O ha y ash i `` on the s ta ll original ly since an c i ent time s .
Some of the w ome n are re al `` G e ish a `` even now .
What beautiful m us ic they play !
Why is no body help ing me to c or re c t my comp o s i tion s ? ? M a y b e no body can understand what I write ? M a y b e my comp o s i tion too b or ing ? What happen ed ? W h o can tell me ? When the first time to write it , I ' m so ex cited to look ing for w ar d some on e would help me .
But it ' s a p ity that no one c or re c t s my comp o s i tion s .
The comp an y s u c ce ed ed in ma k ing a sp e c i al in k that turn s clear when it s te m p er a ture get s over a certain point .
So when you write with this p en , your hand w ri ting look s as if it were written with a b a ll point p en . But , if you c re ate f ri ction , you can er a se as if it were with a p en c il .
You can not us e it on le g al do c u ment s , but for da i ly us e it is very us e ful .
This p en was ch o s en as one of to p ten new pro d u c t s of the year when it first appeared on the mar ke t .
I ' ve po st ed a l in k be l ow .
M ate l To v !
Ka s i a is always s m il ling .
V er y hot
I live in C h i b a .
It ' s very hot the se days .
I dr i p s w e at without do ing anything .
The a ir condition er is ne ce s s ar y .
I ' m read ing an English paper about the a d a p t ive sign al now .
It ' s difficult for me to read paper s in English .
But , I want to study hard and ex p and my know led g e .
how to f a ll as le e p quick ly
R e c ent ly , it take s me a long time to f a ll as le e p every night .
I go to be d at 1 : 0 0 A M , but I ' m a w a ke on the be d for about an hour .
So the next day I feel sleep y and tired all day .
D o you know how to go to sleep quick ly ? ?
My hu s b and ' s high school friend H or i - k un , my hu s b and , and I went to M an ly B e a ch , which was near to C ir c ul ar Q u a y and it took about 3 0 minute s by f er ry .
Then I saw something b l u e like a th re ad in the water , and I thought it must be a fish er man ' s fish ing line .
So I was afraid that there might be a h ook at the end of that thing like a fish ing line , and I thought that might hu r t us .
So I a v o id ed it .
When I not ed those j el ly f ish , an el d er ly la d y spoke to me and she kind ly told me that there was a j el ly f ish al er t on that day .
I found I was st un g by j el ly f ish not only once but on many part s of my body .
It ' s already two week s after the j el ly f ish st un g me , but I still have s c ar s on my le g s .
I am still tra n s la ting my father ' s b ook into English .
L ate ly , a sp e c ies become ex t in c t because of act i v it ies of hu man being s .
The ha b it of an im al s , p l ant s and in se c t s es pe c i ally are de st ro y ed .
The se fact or hi t life di ver s ity .
My L an g u age E x change P ar t n er
I me t my language ex change part n er to day .
She is the same age as me and re ally good at J a p an e se .
It impress ed and in s p ir ed me a l ot .
I us ed to speak J a p n a e se well but I c a n ' t speak it well any m or e .
I re al i z e how easy it is to for g e t la g u age s .
K e e p study ing , it is hard but re ally es s ent i al
But my thought was change d after see ing them . This s er ies of the mo v i e is a story about A n a k in S k y w al k er , who is also D ar th V ad er .
The person who in f l u ence d me the most is my J a p an e se teacher .
In addition , he re c o m m en d ed me to read many b ook s , not only J a p an e se litera ture but also for e i g n one s .
This would b ro ad en my out l ook on life .
No w I would like to be a teacher like him and also I am tak ing a teaching course .
F ir st , we have to dr in k at least 2 0 0 0 c c of water each day .
We can be full of en er g y if we have a good b re a k f a st .
There ' s nothing better than ex er c is e to im p ro ve your he al th , and make you feel better about your s el f .
The start of hard work
So I went to a c a f e .
I like ic ed co f f e e .
B ro n d on did n ' t go back home this week en d , so I took 4 students .
He could n ' t j o in his gr o up unti l just before dinner .
And K ome change d s ta f f as s i g n ment s .
So my s ch ed ul e has change d too .
B e c a us e She ' ll take G e or g e for 3 days .
F ir st , I do n ' t have p at i ence to sit still pe a ce ful ly and not think about the people who have made my life difficult .
I at e a s al ad for l un ch .
I at e co l d noodle s for dinner .
I could n ' t wait for the s un to ri se .
Then by 2 am , my hand s were t re m b ling .
I could n ' t even draw a straight line .
I almost pass ed out .
I even t u ally got some me at to eat , and my body stop p ed feel ing co l d and stop p ed sha k ing .
M a y b e I was b or n as a c ar n i v or e .
I at e gr il led noodle s for l un ch .
They were very good .
But I ' m very bu s y with my work to day .
To be honest , when I came back home from T e x as in the end of M a y ,
my un ive r s ity was already in the middle of the se m est er , which mean s my school did n ' t let me re g is ter for class es this se m est er
As long as my credit s for gradua tion have been comp le ted , it ' s o k a y : - ) I ' ve already take n class es enough to gradua te , p l us I ' m go n n a go on to the 5 th year for job hu n ting .
T h in k ing about job hu n ting make s me feel an x i ous . ) No w I ' m work ing for a s um m er in ter n s h i p , I ' m not sure whether I can be an in ter n for some comp an y though ( B e c a us e it ' s serious ly comp e t it ive and the ch ance s of me get ting into a comp an y are re ally l ow .
As for the comp an y I a p p l i ed for , it he re were over 1 0 0 0 a p p l ic ant s while only 4 or 5 people were hi r ed . ) M an y of my friend s talk re l u c t ant ly a about what ' s going on with their s um m er in ter n s h i p s .
I try not to have high wish es but I ' ll do my be st : - ) I ' m go n n a take an in ter v i e w with a comp an y I re ally w an n a work for this s um m er .
I heard about this we b sit e from my co - work er to day .
I ' m very ex cited to le ar n this s y s te m , and I ' m look ing for w ar d to try ing it out !
just like time
R e c ent ly , there see m s to be a g l o b al e c on o m ic re ce s s ion .
In J a p an , me r ch and is e p ri ce s have been s te ad i ly in c re as ing while e m p l o y ment has been s te ad i ly de c re as ing
M an y J a p an e se comp an ies , es pe c i ally ex p or ter s , have receiv ed business re s ul t s start ing last ter m that have de c re as ed on a dr a m at ic s c al e .
My comp an y is no ex ce p tion ; I f e ar that it may not last ti ll the next g en er ation . ( ? )
But they will have re a ch ed their limit s by next year .
M an ch est er United is the big g est f o ot b a ll c l u b in E ng l and .
That ' s my favor ite tea m .
S in ce he j o in ed M an U , he de d ic at ed to the tea m .
He left the tea m because he con f l ic ted with Sir A le x who was the co a ch of M an U .
I ho pe R o on e y would not go the same way .
[ 2 0 1 1 - 1 - 6 ] It ' s a funny day - 2
On D e ce m b er 2 3 , I sen t a request to study English and J a p an e se at ( an ) English v i ll age .
( B e c a us e of this , ) I have been study ing J a p an e se and English , and soon I ' ll have im p ro v ed my language ability in English and J a p an e se .
keep ing a di ar y every day is so ex ha ust ing
I want to im p ro ve my English , so I de c id ed to write a j o ur n al every day .
But I have f e w to p ic s and my e ng l ish is poor , there f or e it is so difficult for me to keep a di ar y here .
A n y way , of course I c a n ' t so easily give up .
I ' m always surprise d by people here who keep their j o ur n al s in a for e i g n language .
I en v y them .
Y e a h , I know it ' s mean ing less to do so .
S O I W I L L K E E P A J O U R N A L E V ER Y D A Y A N D I ' L L S U R E L Y M A S T ER E N G L I S H S O M E D A Y L I K E T H E M
To day , I went to an in ter n ation al mar ke t , the l i b r ar y and the s up er m ar ke t .
The s un light is get ting strong er and strong er so I was we ar ing a ha t with a wide b ri m .
O h , I want to go to H a w a i i again .
The w in d f l i p p ed up the b ri m and I got a l ot of s un light . . .
I had a b ook I had to return so I went to the l i b r ar y .
The l i b r ar y was going to close at 6 : 0 0 .
I hung out with my friend s yesterday .
When we me t , we did n t know where the `` bu d a e z z i g a e `` re st a ur ant was .
So we walk ed to look for the re st a ur ant for an hour .
We found the re st a ur ant in the end .
But I made my friend s s u f f er by walk ing for an hour .
It ' ll help us s a ve time .
I l o ve to me e t and make many for e i g n friend s .
I ho pe to co m m un ic ate with them and have a good time with them !
My dr e a m is to live in A ust r al i a some time in the future .
It ' s my dr e a m .
On a co u ch
I ' m listen ing to my favor ite m us ic now .
In ti t led `` C ome back home : by T w o do or c in e m a c l u b `` .
T im e for re la x ation . . . . .
What do you usual ly do to re la x ?
I am usual ly read ing a fashion ma g a z in e while listen ing to m us ic .
That ' s my favor ite time .
To m or r ow will be F ri day !
I want ed to got o the sea , to re la x or ( get ri d of hard w or k ing )
I had been see ing it in front of my eyes all day . . .
It was my so n ' s school f est i v al yesterday .
My w if e took part in a mi n i - c ar ra c ing game .
While she was do ing that , the other me m b er of my family had l un ch .
My A m er ic an friend started a m us ic b l o g !
A c t u ally he is a J a p an e se le ar n er , and we have been do ing a language ex change every day for a year and a half over S k y pe .
I re ally think that keep ing a b l o g in the language we are le ar n ing is a great idea because we can us e the language da i ly .
In my case , I l o ve receiv ing commen t s from people because it always en c o ur age s me and mo t i v ate s me to con t in u e keep ing b l o g s in English .
So , to an no un ce his b l o g , I have l in k ed his m us ic b l o g to two of my b l o g s to day .
I also in t ro d u c ed his b l o g to some J a p an e se so c i al ne t w or k ing sit es that I have been us ing like M i x i .
I po st ed his b l o g ' s U R L in my J a p an e se b l o g and on my F a ce b ook wall .
I ho pe his b l o g will become world f a m ous , and he will be able to get many in ter n ation al follow er s .
A fter we gradua ted we had a long b re a k , but f in ally got back in to u ch last year .
I think she almost change d my life because I do n ' t think I would have been the same me without being friend s with her d ur ing that per i o d .
She was living at her bo y f ri en d ' s mo m ' s house with him and his p ar ent s .
In my opinion , her bo y f ri en d see m s like a person who dis c o ur age s her by i g n or ing her .
I am pretty sure having that kind of bo y f ri en d for over se ve n year s has affect ed her person al ity little by little .
I do n ' t know when my dr e a m will come tru e .
I c aught a co l d
3 days a g o I had a so re th ro at . . .
To day I have a run n y no se , head a ch e , and a bad c ough .
T h o se are s y m p t o m s of a co l d .
I c aught a co l d to day : (
When we see an object , we do it by ( c a p t ur ing / receiv ing ) light re f le c ted from the object .
S in ce light pro p a g ate s at a f in ite sp e ed , there must be a de la y in this pro ce s s .
The C M B is not only a me s se ng er who st or es an en or m ous am o un t of i nformation about the e ar ly un ive r se , but also im p or t ant c l u es to answer es s ent i al question s since the begin n ing of hu man history , like `` what is the sha pe of the un ive r se ? `` , `` what is the future of the un ive r se ? ``
My re se ar ch is a im ed at g i v ing a more a c c ur ate an a ly s is of the C M B , by ex a m in ing the in ter a ction between p la s m a in c l ust er s of ga la x ies and the C M B .
I believe that ex p l or ing the un ive r se we live in is one of the most im p or t ant v o c ation s one can ex pe ri ence
No body can . for e te ll .
F or this reason , we should make an effort to ful f i ll our dr e a m s or wish es .
What do you see your s el f do ing in five year s time ?
I ' d like to study over se as to m aster English again and I need to le ar n some me th o d s to make my less on s more at t r a c t ive and enjoy able .
In addition , I need to know a l ot about the c ul t ur al di f f er ence s between J a p an and other co un t ri es because I believe that I should not only tea ch English but also help my students understand c ul t ur al di f f er ence s in English class .
As my d aught er is now e i g h t year s old , she will gradua te from e le ment ar y school and will be going to j un i or high school five year s from now .
I ho pe to ma in tain a good re l ation s h i p with her .
Yes ter day night , I began p l an n ing to go to a live conc er t of one of the most well - know n b and s in J a p an .
The b and ' s name is M r .
I do n ' t know why they have this name ( and I ' m sure they are not re al ch il d re n , as they are all over thirty year s old .
A c t u ally , I have never been to a de c ent conc er t .
Some of my friend s have been to conc er t s and they all say they enjoy ed them so o o o o o o o much , and when ever I heart he m say anything like that , I en v y them so much .
T h us , I de c id ed that this year I would like to , or I must at ten d a live conc er t !
A t the same time , if it is both er s ome , I de c id ed to go to the most p op ul ar one !
However , there are things I had to do , first .
F ir st , get ting ti c ke t s is so difficult , because so many people in ten d to go .
They are very p op ul ar in J a p an .
And another pro ble m is my part n er ' s ex a m might be on the same day as the conc er t , but we are not sure yet .
There are some sit u ation s where in we should not us e mo b i le p h on es .
F or ex amp le when we are in class or in a meeting at work .
This is is s u e a ri se s de b ate right now .
This does not just conc er n a d ul t s .
E ver y on e need s to know whether is a p p ro p ri ate to us e mo b i le p h on es in certain sit u ation s .
So even if b r ing ing ce ll p h on es is b an n ed at school ,
It is not a good b as is to j ud g e them .
C h il d re n should le ar n good manner s while they are you ng .
I re al i z ed that I ve work ed for 2 7 days without ho l i day !
I ' ll go to T ur ke y for 9 days start ing tomorrow .
It ' ll be great if some body has anything in f o about T ur ke y for me !
As you know , J F A name d A l b er t o Z a c ch er on i as the new co a ch of the J a p an e se n ation al f o ot b a ll tea m , however , he could n ' t be at this game because he did not get his v is a .
This was the first time in 1 0 year s I saw the n ation al tea m ' s ma t ch live .
A bout 66 0 0 0 people were ga ther ed at the st ad i um , which is the ma x im um c a p a c ity of the st ad i um .
What is good new s for me is that 7 of the start ing play er s play s over se as .
Ka g a w a who play s for B or us s i a D or tm un d in G er man y got the go al .
It was beautiful go al .
n at ive speak er s :
The con se c t ive ho l i day s , an even t which last ed for about 1 0 days , was over .
D ur ing that per i o d we sp ent l ot s of money f ri v o l ous ly , which we had not

C on se qu ent ly , we now have a hard time living e c on o m ic ally
.
I c l ic k on another ta b on my b r ow s er and g l ance at la ng - 8 .
C or re c ting or commen ting to some on e ' s di ar y make s me a w a ke .
L an g - 8 is kind of re st or at ive for me : )
I ' m a j un i or high school st ud ent .
B y the way , I l o ve J a p an e se dr a m . dr um m ing or dr um s
J a p an e se dr a m ( dr um m ing ) is called `` T A I K O `` in J a p an e se .
T h an k u for your polite and w ar m me s s age s and c or re ction s ! ! !
I want ed to re p ly to all of them .
So I will write me s s age s this week .
G in z a is J a p an ' s most ex p en s ive re al est ate .

Yes ter day , I went to see my da d in K o b e .
It is near O s a k a st ation .
I did n ' t have enough time to take p ic s , but I found some through the in ter ne t .
H a ha , I ' ve no idea , but I can gue s s the own er of that bu il d ing w o n ' t se ll his re al est ate , and the ro ad con st r u c t or s had no way out .
On S at ur day , I at ten d ed a le c ture about p re v ent ive me d ic in e .
So people now have more interest in what they eat in the U S A .
The go ver n ment im po s ed a tax on c ar b on at ed dr in k s ( like C o ke ) , and every f o o d has a la b el in d ic at ing n ut ri tion , es pe c i ally tra n s - f at .
T r an s - f at is very ha r m ful to your he al th , but many kind s of j un k f o o d , like ha m b ur g er s , f ri ed potatoes , and p i z z a con tain tra n s - f at .
S in ce J a p an e se f o o d , like s us h i and s ash im i , con tain s less tra n s - f at , it has re c ent ly become very p op ul ar in the U S A .
