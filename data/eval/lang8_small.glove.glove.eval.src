So I went to cellphone shop and I questioned why it restarted by itself every time .
The assistant said without feeling that he did n't know the reason and it needed to repair at head office .
Also he mentioned that it might cost a charge .
Then I totally get mad and I said , `` Huh !
What do you mean by you did n't know at all ? ?
You mean although I buy broken thing , I have to put in money ?
I ca n't understand .
Forget it !
you are good for nothing ! ``
In the end , this problem has n't solved yet . . .
and I need to be a gentleman .
I have found good study English web site
Because they take too much money .
I have heard some ariticle that some English classes does n't good at teach English or some student does n't make any sense or fit their English level .
I might lucky girl because I can understand English even thouh I do n't take any lesson .
But myEnglish level is middle .
I can conversation with native speaker .
I am glad I speak English and conversation with naitive people .
I ca n't good at speaking English but I can get along with native people .
I am happy that I could make a friends with native people
If you come to Japan and speak a few Japanese , you will be praised for speaking Japanese , even if the sentence you speak is very short .
That 's because Japanese people think Japanese language is one of the most difficult languages in the world .
They have prides in their own language .
However , in my opinion , Japanese is n't the difficult language compared to other languages .
There are two reasons .
Japanese have fewer vowels and consonants than English .
He wanted to say he was in the middle of the campain and said loudly , `` I have an erection now ! ``
The hardest one is to distinguish `` hurt `` from `` heart `` , `` fast `` from `` first `` .
It sounds absolutely same to Japanese .
Japanese pronunciation is easier than other asian languages as well .
It has much more complex sound than the one of Japanese .
It does n't have male verbs and female verbs such as French , Spanish and Russian .
No singular forms and plural forms .
No articles needed .
Fewer patterns of conjugation .
These are the two reasons for which I believe Japanese is not difficult .
I believe most difficult thing in learning Japanese is writing it because most people are n't used to its letters .
But you should n't hesitate to start to learn Japanese .
I brought my dog trimmed yesterday .
The first photo is the before , others are the after .
I think everybody has similiar mind and similar posibilities .
Here is my question .
Maybe there are some reserach why people fail when they try to learn language ?
Yesterday , my school was a hat day .
If we wanted to wear our hat , we had to pay $ 2 .
The money is contributed .
But I did n't wear my hat because I forgot this day ^ ^
Listening to English program , studying English magazine , etc .
We have to studed English now , or we wo n't pass an important test after three years .
There is going to have a Jananess school to viste our school .
And I going to receive one of the student .
We have eight Japaness students in each class .
We have a lesson with them .
And we will teach Taiwaness history about Japan aggress Taiwan .
We all laughed after our history teacher told us that .
Maybe we will say something about contribution after Japaness aggress us .
We will have a lot of activies when Japaness students come .
I went to Okinawa , which is southern part of Japan , as a school event this week .
We were there for four days , and the first three days were rainy and cloudy , so I did n't feel I was in southern island .
Also , the hotel we stayed at on the last day was at the center of Naha City , the capital city of Okinawa , so it made me feel like I was in Tokyo , too .
But It was the last big event in my highschool life , so I enjoyed spending time with my friends there and visiting many places .
We did water activities in the beautiful ocean , visited an aquareum and a museum , and other things .
Everything went well without any trouble , and the trip made me realize an important thing , so I think it was nice to have this experience .
I have been quite busy in last couple of days becouse of my exams at the University .
I 'm a student at the Silesian University of Technology , at the faculty of Environmental Engineering .
I enjoy my classes a lot and I know I will miss them when I will graduate .
I have one last exam left and when I passe it , I 'm going to have some holidays .
Me and my dad are going to visit France to go skiing there .
I ca n't wait : ) When we will back I will have to start working at my thesis which is about ventilation and heating in passive house .
My main task is to make a project of it and make a cost - effectiveness analysis .
I remember the day when I first watched Terminator 2 .
It was a really exciting film with two cyborg guys called terminator chasing and fighting each other .
But it made me wonder how soon we would see the society where such cyborgs or humanoid robots are living with us .
Although it still takes time before we can actually create such sophisticated cyborgs , we may soon be able to have a simpler humanoid robot which can help us in our daily lives .
So if you want one of the robots to move his right arm , for example , all you need to do is just think about it in your head .
This is awesome .
I 'm a little concerned that this kind of technology would be used for a military purpose ( as you can see in the movie ) .
I know , for better or worse , technological developments have always come hand in hand with military activities .
By the way , I think the movie has its sequel .
After I came back home , I put on same - color upper to match with it and I was satisfied with the looks .
I lost my hat on last saturday .
I got mail about it was found .
It 's really cool to meet a lot of foreigne friends here .
Many lovely people gives me courage and correction , even though my Eng .
is a big disaster , you guys still correct my mistake patiently .
I have been itchy eyes all day .
My friends said that you did n't scratch eyes .
That 'll make it worse .
I thought about the cause .
I registered to this site today .
That means weekend is just around corner .
This weekend , my family will be held party to celebrate my dad 's birthday .
I am not decided yet but must set up for it at least this afternoon .
I am thinking about sports wear to buy for him to encourage him to do work out .
She will stay 4days .
I ca n't wait for her .
Anyway I have a plan to go to Kyoto r Nara .
What do you think to go there ?
Does she like it ?
I do n't know what kind of food does she like .
You can park your car just next to the hotel .
You can not park your car here in front due to the no parking zone area .
As soon as I wrote dairly , some corrected comments recieved .
So I 'd like to continue to write my dairly .
My dog `` Fal `` who is Itarian gray hound , he does n't like
stay at home alone .
Only a few hours , he misses me .
But dogs life is n't so long , I ' am going to stay with him

I write diary in English for the first time ,
so my English is not good yet .
I hope you can correct it .
Today was my birthday : )

It was great birthday !
But When I leaved my home , I would be late .
The bus that I wanted to get on was was late to .
As a result I was able to get on the bus , and I was just in time for job .
About Kitties .
I 'm staying my friends house now .
I think being cute is stronger than any thing now .
If now is the ancient age , they would be killed or eaten immediately by snake or something , but now is modern era .
Snake or something is picked out from their position by much stronger animal , human being .
So , kitties got much more power with their cutie .
Kitty 's perfect cutie is much more powerful than incomplete power of snake or something now .
Many people gathered there to be a stronger tennis player .
After practicing , me and Asano matched with strong pair .
To tell the truth , they were n't that strong , but we lost .
Asano was in the bad condition today .
I realized when my pair was in the bad condition , all you need is a teamwork .
I think many people are all have their new year 's aim , so do I .
My new year 's aim is that passed Japanese 2level and improve my english .
Since I worked , my study intereting is less than before when I was in college .
But I found if you don not study your brain may be more and more not bright .
So I suppose that we must study if only have time .
I think you should n't be able to choose when they want to die .
Since it also murder .
Some people said it not only help for the end of theirs pain but also it help to slove their family 's economic problems .
They have a right which is their live a quiet life for the rest of their days .
This is a bless .
If they had a crime , they could atone .
I have n't been much of histric buff myself .
So , I do n't know the details of ancient civilizations .
I think they are still relevant today because histry has a way of repeating itself .
That way , they can feel familiar with the acient history .
I think when you study history , it 's good idea for us to try to seek what the history has in common with our society now .
God - bye , 2009 !
I live in NY since September , moving from Japan , and discover and wonder new things about US , writing about my questions or comment .
the other day I was shocked with the dispute on TV show .
she reported her kid seemingly behaves strangely so that she asked what is wrong with her then she confessed their father , I mean her husband abuse the daughter .
the TV show was end up that she lied because she wanted to get back the custody of her first daughter who now lives with her ex husband .
the reason that she was deprived of her custody of first child was she was overdoes of cocain ( I forgot why she had it at that time )
I thought Court TV show should deal with easy case , but I do n't know what is easy and what is serious in US .
about the rest of my UK life
Today is the second day of May .
Four monthes have passed since the new year 's day and this means that my visa expires within ten monthes .
Recently , I have been thinking how to spend the rest of my time in this country .
I left London at the beggining of March and I 've been working on the farm for two monthes .
I can say that my life on the farm has been better than what I imagined before beginning it .
But , honestly , I am feeling a little bit tired because of having been doing physical works for two monthes .
Fortunately , I have some things to do in London at the end of this month .
So it must be a good chance for me to take a rest and decide what I do after then .
I have n't decided yet , but , after taking a rest , I would start working on the farm again and keep doing it as long as possible .

The Calligraphy of Chinese and the traditonal Chinese painting !
Hi , foreign friends , especially who like Chinese culture , I want to show you two important parts of Chinese culture today !
The Calligraphy of Chinese , which has 3000 years at least , is a brilliant traditional art .
I have learned it by myself , the picture in my album is wrote by myself ( * _ * ) .
The Chinese painting , the another traditional art , is drew by writing brush which is also used to Calligraphy !
the picture in my album is also drew by myself .
The Calligraphy of Chinese and the traditonal Chinese painting both
So this article must be wrong in many place , thanks for your correcting and advice ! )
I come back to home .
I take a Monorail .
My house is convenience .
Becouse near station .
I have no religion , but the class is held for anyone who is interested in .
Although I 'm not that school student , they welcome me , so this is really good opportunity to learn English and Bible .
Since our regular teacher have to work for another temporary job for 6 weeks , my American friend who used to a student of the class substitutes for our teacher for the time being .
I have become to feel closer to her than before .
This year I 've started to study ballet , it 's known that you only can learn to dance ballet when you are a child , or at least that was I always tought , but I was lucky to have the chance .
I wo n't lie , I was really ashamed because I was the oldest of the girls there , but with time passing I learnt to enjoy it ^ ^
Our professor always says : `` I will never permit my students to be less than me , you have to be equal or better than me ``
This month he wants our debut as a ballet company , not only as a academy , so we are doing a show with another academies of Peru , Chile and Argentina .
We are doing `` Coppelia `` , even if we are not proffesionals dancers just adding a little of fun to the original play is doing it great .
Is It Good to be Persuasive
In my culture , people are not always aggrassive , and we are always thinking about others more or as much as ourselves .
Since I were not from the States , I am not sure about the culture here .
As far as I have heard and experieced , the culture here is that people care about themselves more than others and they are more self - centered , which I do n't mean in a good way or bad way .
Since the culture is very important in the everyday life .
\ what we should act depend on the culture or norm in the place we live .
For example , in my country , the distance between people is small , so everything can be flexible and depends on the relationship between people involed .
However , in the United States , regulations and laws are first .
Therefore , I always think before I act becuase I am not sure what is the right way to do .
For example , I have a question : if someone refused your proposal , is it ok to be persuasive and ask the person again ?
Today , I went to watch movie .
A title is `` eat play love `` Julia Roberts is playing in this show .
My friend said the satisfaction of this movie is not so good by a survey on the website , but I do n't think so .
It was good movie .
She who is the main character in this show traveled Ltaly , India and Bali .
She met many peple and found herself .
She took maditation in India .
It seems so hard but I think itYs a good way to see myself deeply .
If I have some problem , I want to try doing it .
Moreover , When I saw the scene in Italy , it made me want to go to Italy .
Actually , I have been there and ate pasta and pizza .
The pizza that I ate in Italy is the best in my life .
I want to eat that one again .
It has been 3months since I came here .
I was supposed to give lectures right after moving into this city , but fortunately ( ? ) at that time it was a vacation .
At the first time I enjoyed my free time .
I realized that doing nothing makes my body and soul tired the most .
The most difficult thing in someone 's life might is to find exact Clothes , I think .
Where my clothes is waiting for me ?
Is there any clothes that fit me . . ?
( But , , . .
Actually I bought 3 shirts and 1 pants . .
That 's it . . )
If I find a pretty good clothes , put it down first .
is this thing I really want ?
Next , If the clothes is really good on me , Please think again , Is this what I really necessary ? ?
I bought one pants a few months ago .
Whenever I put on that pants , It looks like hip hop style .
It do n't fit my body , It makes me look like dwarf .
It was impulse buying . .
So , I decide when I buy any clothes , I 'll follow that step ! !
If your friend say you to buy something , Say `` Let me sleep on it `` .
Studio Ghibli was established for Miyazaki in 1985 .
Studio Ghibli has to continue living as a company , so , it has to cultivate new talents of animation films .

Young creators were burst with pressures by Miyazaki .

It means literally `` go out of the hospital `` ?
or it means `` go out with thier boyfriends or girlfriends `` ?
These two sentences mean exactly the same thing ?
The famaous rapper that known by Japanese people .
Maybe it is only young people know about Eminem .
Maybe the other airtist are n't known by Japanese people .
Maybe the Japanese people likes rap or R & B who would know the other rapper .
Why is Eminem known by the Japanes people is he was acting the movies , 8mile .
From then I like him .
Before he was acting the movie I was like his songs .
He had sold fun rap music those day .
There was such a rap music but there was n't being such a Eminim .
Since I started working at the University , I remember often my high school days .
I had some good friends and laughed a lot everyday .
We talked about someone we were interested in , teachers , baseball games , music , motor cycle , part - time job and our dreams . . !
That was a pretty good days for us .
But we might have studied more . .
When we graduate from the high school , my friends gave me a great prize .
That was `` the funnest prize in a class `` !
But my friend got the prettiest girl prize , another friend got the smartest prize . . . .

It 's been a big problem to me for a long time .
today when I was studying English , I realized that I was n't eligible to become a teacher because I did n't know of good conversations .
I think I 'm not qualified to become a teacher unless I enjoy conversations .
If you do n't have communication skill , you should n't teach .
As I realized above conclusion this afternoon , I went to a church where I hung out a lot .
There I decided to talk what I have in mind more positively .

But Siberia is very very big .
On the most area summer is every year .
Once I heard that in Siberia bears walk on towns ' streets .
And in the New Year people catch all bears in their town , harness them and ride on sledges all night .
There are bears ofcourse .
They live in deep forests , not in cities .
I live in Siberia all my life and meet bears only in the zoo .
Today , the morning is cool , and the afternoon is warm .
For this reason , we have to be careful of catching a cold .
Today , because there were not lots of people , I spent my spare time .

Englsih speakers use high frequency .
When English speakers speak English , they are using very high tones compared to Japanese people .
Sometimes I am watching and listening English artists ' movie on You Tube , but even male artists ' tones are very high .
Especially some female English speakers are speaking English with very high tones .
It looks like very pretty for Japanese men .
As if their voices are Japanese voice actors who are acting child .
I like Linking Park .

I met some school security guys and they asked us , `` Are you guys coming here to apply the college ? `` , but we were just tourists so we said that we did n't have nothing to do , so we came here ~ haha . ``
I personally think nobody wants to visit or apply the college on Christmas day ~ Christmas is a special holiday for many people , right ?
I want to go to penn sate again because we visited some historical museum but they were closed so We just took some pictures in front of them .
Today , my roommate awaken me up early in the mornig though because she thought I was oversleep .

but I never see snow any where in Vietnam .
Snow is never falling down .
I study English by lang - 8 from now on !
Because I want to learn that writing and speaking skill in English .
However I have snow in my university town today .
Recently , we have strange weathers more and more .
When people are going to celebrate a special event such as graduation or a special party , some of them prefer a large party , while some of them prefer a small party a few close friends and family members . Which do you prefer ?
When it comes to whether we should ask people as more as possible to attend our celebrations with central importance , this issue is always very thought - provoking and worthy of serious deliberations .
Some people love to invite many friends and relatives to share their happiness , but others hold a worlds - apart opinion , believing that the best memory should only be shared with their close friends and family members .
Personally speaking , I prefer to celebrate my important date with a lot of people .
First of all , I can make friends with the people who will probably help me in the future .
As a proverb goes , the more social connections you have , the more likely you could have a smooth life .
I met my Japanese teacher , Richard , on my graduation party .
Supposing my best friend , Jack , had not invited him to our party , I could not have the chance to learn Japanese from Richard .
With the help of Richard , I work for a great renowned Japanese company , MoToSiBa , and get a decent salary .
Therefore , it is Richard that opens this window for me .
Second , a party is more than just food and wine since it is a good place to practice social skills .
Some people may cry out that they do not feel totally relax if they stay in a situation with few acquaintances .
However , social skills are really essential when they enter into a company .
If I had one more chance to practice my social skills , I would do my utmost to talk to the people who I did not familiar with in any circumstances .
This point is quite obvious to be understood when you compared the New Year 's Eve and your pet 's birthday .
Everybody will agree that thousands of people crowd on the street at that time to celebrate this wonderful event is far happier than celebrating their pet 's birthday at home .
The reason is - - It is the number matters .
On the one hand , numbers create a good atmosphere , and on the other hand , no sooner scream the first person than everyone in the same place get excited .
Thus , the sheer number of people create joyful atmosphere .
To conclude , I love to ask people come to my party as more as possible .
Not only can I meet the people who might help me in the future , but also , I am able to improve my social skills through this party .
Besides , the more people in my party , the better atmosphere it will be .
when I go to the foreign countries that I am scare two things , such as
I went to japan for stady , but I never stady Japanese before .
it is difficult to live there at the moment .
be cause I ca n't speak Japneses and hard to make friends in Japan that let me feel so lonely , and want to give up stady in Japan .
Even though you might thought that we do n't practice earnestly , in fact , we do .
Result of today ` s work
After long time , I did carpentar work today .
My physical was declining . . .
It ` s so frastrating , but It ` s reality .
In the future , as far as possible , I continued to do carpentry !
When I went to seattle , I used bus a few times .
And I realized there was no announce or indication that shows the next bus stop 's name .
In Japan , there always be digital screen and announce , which makes me relax till the destination even if it is the first time using that bus .
How do you think about it ?
Please tell me .
I watched interesting news program in this morning .
Jack ( Kiefer Sutherland ) came to Japan .

I have never spoken English .

Do you know the kitty - chan ?
I often hear famous people like Lady Gaga love it .
As for me , I did n't hate it , but I did n't especially like it .
I often hang out with one of my co - workers , K .
One day , she said , `` I 'll introduce my friend to you because you look like you 'll get along with my friend . ``
: Middle - aged guy whose hobby is to collect kitty - chan products .
I was surprised at first , but I gradually got used to him , and I like the way K can make friends with anybody .
The guy who loves kitty - chan looks really happy when he got his new collecting item .
So , every time I see kitty - chan , I care about it like `` Does he have this item ? `` , and the more I look at it , the more I feel it 's cute .
My goals in a long run
My some words did n't convey the meaning what I want to say .
Language is a tool to communicate with people , so bad pronunciation means a bad communication .
When I go back to Japan , I want to make my English better like native speakers .
There are so many words to pronounce for Japanese such as really , relatively , vocabulary and so on .
There are some similar sound , but this sound is like between R and L .
So Japanese people 's tongue do n't get used to pronounce them .
To achieve my goals , there seem like so many difficulties on the route .
On the 15th of this month , I sang two songs on the stage of my company ' s year - end party with my colleagues .
Although there was a acoustic trouble in the first minute , the stage was successful largely .

I hope I will be able to speak anything what I want to say in the near future .

That is thing what I feel happy today ! How about you ? Do you have some good news to me ?
Usually , I make a call once a week , but these couple of weeks I did n't .
On the phone , she said , `` Well , there 's nothing special , but I 'm wondering how are you doing . `` I said , `` I 'm OK , mom .
Sorry for not making a phone call and how have you been ?
`` Our conversation continue this way .
She is 80 now , and she repeats the same thing again , I mean , same one as which I had heard last time .
I listen to her nodding , `` hm . . , that 's good . . . . oh . . . `` and my last words arealways the same , `` Take good care of yourself , Mom . ``
This phone call reminded me of my blog family member 's entry journal `` Real Mothers `` .
`` Real Mothers know that a child 's growth is not measured by height or your grade . . .
She 's way out of date !
45 years of age - - Wonder what Mom would have thought about it .
65 years of age - - Wish I cloud talk it over with Mom .
I 'm lucky and happy because she is going well and I 'm in the situation which I can afford to listen to her .
Mother 's day is coming soon , and my mother always says , `` I do n't want anything , and I 'm glad that you care about me , and it 's enough . `` when I asked her what I can do for her .
This year I could somehow got to know what she wanted now , so I 'm going shopping for her , `` a nice blouse `` .
Thank you for corrected to my daily .
I 'm very happy , but I think to study English .
I 'm very cold to my house .
I 'm eating breakfast for hot noodle .
Virginia , how are you being on this Christmas ?
I was 12 years old when I first heard of your Christmas story written as an editorial of New York Sun .
I was a know - it - all boy and I got frown at that time .
I do n't remember what exactly I thought , but I just did n't like a beautiful story that everyone would love , and did n't think anything what it means .
Very sorry about that , but one little child has many things other than thinking around a story from a foreign country .
Now I am enough old .
For a grown - up , I have much time to do that kind of thing .
I said I got frown when I read this story , probably because I did not believe in Santa at that time even though I knew it would be comfortable for me to believe in Santa .
Logic has very strong power that persuades any human beings , but after all they ca n't live only with it .
Who in the world would think funny or interesting to see a boy saying , `` logically to say , Santa is my parents .
So , he does not exist with probability of 100 % . `` Even the most optimistic forecaster would never think he will be happy in his life .
She is far better than the logical boy at least for me because she knows how to enjoy her life without dropping into the logical whirl .
She knows this whirl is so powerful that drew everyone whereas she also knows this is not necessary to make her daily life happy .

But my motive at first is just for fun .
Now I wonder this reason is too weak to learn efficienyle , because there is few chance to work by English at my job .

How build up the organization system is one of the most important decision for companies .
These days , the flat organization has been considered one of the best ways to motivate employees .
However , in my view , I firmly believe that the somewhat fierce competition from classification of employees and grades is necessary for the efficiency of organizations .
Above all , as far as money is concerned in this capitalism society , ranks are necessary for the efficiency .
The reason that capitalism societies have been able to be developed is the belief that the wealth of riches was properly compensated and this has motivated people to strive to follow them by working hard and developing special something .
Given companies in capitalism society ; this case can also be applied for the matter of ranks in business world .
If there is no differentiation about the consequence of work , employees would think that there would be no needs for work .

look back the life in the US
As I looked back on my life in the US , there are so many things which gave me shocked . , in other words , the cultural shocks .
At the first days I got to the US , I met people having sex in the bathroom .
I 've also met three gay people kissing at the same time at a party .
Of course , the fact that most people habitually smoke weed is also surprising for me .
Other than them , crazy drinking of college students , and people who always keep the door open when someone is coming following them are also some of those .
Although those cultural differences are totally new for me and sometimes scared me , I 've always been trying to adapt to the culture of US .
After that , I could find that I like this culture , and I 'm more like an American .
So far , my life in the US is going well , but when it comes to mentioning about my English , I still never be satisfied with mine .
To know more about people or the culture , I 'll try more .

The crow appeared soon and gave them a large pot , then he explained : `` If you turn your ladle to the right side in the pot , it will give you Polo [ 1 ] and if you turn it to the left side , the pot will give you stew [ 2 ] .
The old couple happily took the pot home , they invited all their neighbors and relatives for dinner and they fed them all .
Some days after that the jealous neighbor requested for the pot saying that they had some guest that night , the simple - hearted old woman handed the pot to him , but he never gave it back .
Unfortunately the village 's Khan 's servants witnessed the happening and took the donkey by force as a khan belonging .
The couple were so unhappy for losing the crow 's gift , so they decided to try the crow once more .

But I 'm really grateful if I could heal his sadness .
There would be good things and also bad things in our business life .

I think that the important thing to break the difficulties is keeping your mind positive whatever the circumstance is .
I saw news about Slutwalk in USA and Canada .
The women who was told ' do not walk like a slut ' by police in Canada have been angry and launched campaign .
I think the police did it more carefully but they said the true .
Their behaviors are their choices , but there are n't only gentle men in the world .
Our choices deserve respect , but we shoulder the responsibility .
Basically I wish the sexual attacks would be gone out , However you know , I do not think it could be .
Judas `` lady gaga `` and taxic `` brtney spears ``
I like Lady gaga and britney speas .
Because I think Lady gaga is positive and unprejudiced person and britney is sexy !
The one is Judas and the other is Taxic .
Definitely I translated that words though , but I do n't understand the meanings what they want to say .
When I was a university student , I was a menber of ski team .

It is Canadian coffee shops .
They have a lot of shops than starbacks coffee in Canada !
It is so difficult for me because I had n't know how to buy and say in English . . .
Anyway , I should n't hesitate just to buy coffee ! !
so I decided to enter the coffee shop !
I said `` ah - . . .
double - double ! ! ``
by the way , `` double - double `` means two sugar and two milks ! !
I was told it by my host family !

I met some people in my American friend 's birthday dinner party last evening .
I met my friend 's friends , my friend 's cousin , and cousin 's friend .
Foods are okay , price is okay , and okay atmosphere .
That girls talked fast .
I could n't catch up native speaker 's speed .
My Japanese friend could catch up it .
I 've been staying here almost three month .
I spoke only greeting yesterday .
I 'm usually talkative person , but I was really quiet yesterday .
I can understand in English .
Actually , a speed is important for casual conversation .
I still do n't a new job . . .
So , I 'll go a interview tonight .
Tomorrow I 'll go a interview .
I 'm in a hurry . . .
I sure knew the difference of spelling between American English and British English .
But then , all people who I talked with there spoke fast , and my understanding for English was too poor , comparing to the present .
( yes , I still have a poor command of English . . . )
How do most of American people feel about British English ?
Which English do European people learn ?
Perhaps , in Japan we study American English .
And generally , the global standard might be put on American English .
Someone , please tell me , what is the most difference between them ?

All the train of Tokyo metropolitan area was completely stopped .

I have experienced Canadian New Year for the first time .
I prefer Canadian New Year to Japanese one .
Because the dinner is very gorgeous and yummy ! !
I do n't like Japanese traditional dishes at New Year .
I mean , salt in low , fat in low . . .
The only thing I like in all is Japanese rice cake .
On the other hand , today we had a lot of feasts full of the table .
A roast beef , a mush potato , pine nuts roll ( this is that stuffings which consists of pine nuts , flour , meats and so on is rolled into pie seat or something ) and dessert with eggknock ( this is a kind of drinks .
Milk , eggs , sugar are mixed together .
Many Canadian like this .
While that , I told about how we celebrate New Year in Japan .
The meanings of each dish , New year 's gift and so on .
They do n't have a custom like New Year 's gift .
That 's what I like about Japanese New Year .
There is a seventeen years old girl .
She is called Mio .
One day , the girl has a chance to visit the northern country .
She love the atmosphere , so she stroll through the forest every morning during staying .

We need to keep concentrating during its long testing time .

It 's rainy season at June in Japan .
There is a bad weather all day ,
But while running , the strong rain suddenly came falling ,
Although I did n't have a cold , I encountered in a bad situation .
I hope the rainy season will end early !
Yesterday my friends and I went to school , and got an English speaking class .
We 've graduated from high school ( Feb . 8 was graduation ceremony ) in fact .
But we asked a teacher to make an English speaking class even after the ceremony .
The class was very interesting to us .
Especially `` The Guessing Game `` was so ! !
The game is to answer what is wrote on the paper that is above answerer 's head .
Another people give a hint to the answerer .
It is difficult to give a hint and answer .
A Handy Crear Folder Within Textbook ( Brushed up )
the walking with my bag will be training for fullfill my ability to carry more weight .
I ca n't get the skill to carry heavyer bag , ,
I copy my text book into falf size and sort out these to each period .
When I come out from my house ,
I pick up the necessary part for one day study .
I put these parts into a hurf of typing size clear folder .
I can put this clear folder into all of my bags with a hurf of typing size notebook .
So I got the oppotunity to study on every situation .
I think it is effective to increase the frequency of study for getting necessary skills .
Why do n't you make ubiquious studying environment .
I have not gone out at all when my school has been done . .
I feel that I want to go out or want to see my friends though I do nothing in my home recently .
the first reason : I have a lot of H .
W which I have not even start working yet .
the seconds reason : Need to safe money until I graduate .
Let me tell you what happened during weekend .
On sunday , I was very busy for preparing to send my students to their country , Korea .
Other teachers and I went to the airport , and we did some works for procedures to enter the airport gate .
But we misssed !
we missed our areline .
We were late 10 minutes .
We begged for help but student 's seats
We came back home and waited for vacant seats .
Fortunately , the seats were enough to go all students going back to Korea although It took a quite long time .
The mango pudding which I often purchase consists of four layers , each of a little different color and flavor .
All the layers are in harmony with into one ! !
It 's the first time I visit this site
After two month , I have to be interviewed in English to enter a company
Many time , I only listen and read .
I think that the reason why I ca n't speak and write English
I searched to find a good website to help me study English and finally I found this site
I 'll help those who want to study Korean and I need you help
s the following sentence is grammatically right ?
We are the camera club members .
We will try to joint purchase a new camera , and performance a good one .
It 's all good but too expensive .
I think that it seems to like a good small and cheap .
How does a percentage discount it expensive ?
Do you a little bit more discount ?
So this let 's decision .
17 / 10 / 10 - BBQ at a Park
We were planing to go to the Zoo , but everyone was busy working .
So we cancelled .
Since it was sunny , I went to the nearest park with my roommate instead .
We did BBQ at the park , Cleland Park .
The park is equipped with a hear device , so unless we clean it after eating , we can use I suppose .
In addition , There is some tennis courts next to the park !
I always feel like playing it although I can not play well .
We talked about the job in each country and marriageable age .
I am not sure that we can drink in public place .
In japan , it is OK .
How about your country ?
Today , I learned washing a machine of gastrocamera in my clinic for the first time .
All this time I was very serious for do n't fall down it .
Because I heard that my doctor bought it about 3000000JPY .
So it is very expencive .
I was really surprised it .
It will be able to buy a car if I had such a big money .
And I ca n't help me if I fall down it .
So that I am very serious to wash it .
And I enjoyed washing the camera .
I always happy doing work .
Well ,
My friend girl will be marrige this year in the Montana .
She is one of my close friend but it looks like younger sister or family so I have been feeling happy for it .
I will be there when she has Wedding ceremony .
Yesterday , I started to write my journal , but nobody check that .
or the theme is only just boring .
Today , I went to shopping to buy chocolate .
Most Japanese like sweet taste chocolate with cookie something .
Only chocolate is not so attractive for most japanese .
Because Japanese like carbohydrates .
As you already know , they always eat rice and noodle as staple food .
So , I think that 's why Japanese like to eat something with carbohydrates .
Therefore , Most Japanese like sweet taste chocolate with cookie .
First , I study English for three hours everyday as posible as after work .
Although you know it is the inevitable natural process , it is hard not to think about it too much .
My father is 55 years old this year , instead of paying attention to keep healthy by exercise like peers , my father like spending lots of time browsing news on the internet .
I really wish all those aging process can be slowed down or at least not that noticeable , but the fact is that I can clearly and strongly sense them , which is really painful .
We took a bath early , and ate toshikoshi - soba , the buckwheat noodles eaten on Neew Year 's Eve .
Therefore now I can take my time .
My neighbors held a party and I am hearing Latin music since this afternoon .
It started raining a while ago , but the music does n't stop sound .
I participated in a match of the tennis today .
I belong to the company 's tennis team , and today was a opening match for this season .
We won the first set but we lost second set .
Finally , we lost final set .
It was so close match and we played about 2 hours and half .
And I felt the sting of defect because we lost such a close game .
I 'll prepare better for the next week match .
Playing tennis is so fun and relieve my stress .
hm , Just joke .

I think , she was very strong , nice , and handsome ( or pretty )
even though was girl .
My English name ' Oscar ' ,
It recalls remembrance to my mind .
The starring of it is Johnny Depp .
This movie starts when James Matthew Barrie , an English dramatist , meets the boy who is model of Peter Pan .
I did n't know about how `` Peter Pan `` was written , so this story was so intersting .
I 'll have lots of time to learn English next month .
Because the banquet rooms I work will be vacant on the month .
It 's a good thing , unless saved money will be diminishing without mercy .
It 's not that I 'm not satisfied with time and money I have ,
but it 's a bit short of feeling wealthiness .
I think the reason is what my current job is not the job I really love .
Although I do n't hate my job , rather I like my colleagues .
But I avoided the hardship , as a result , I stand this place .
I 'm no longer young to change my job .
That is English .
It 's my homework to English writting subject .

I 'm puzzled to think when I finish reading this book : x
I have used a couple of web browsers which are Internet explorer , Firefox , Safari and Google chrome .
I can save the time and feel comfortable .
Beside , user friendly interface is attractive .
But sometime I am annoyed by bizarre options .
Actually , I was n't able to see pdf files by chrome .
Finally , I solved the issue to enter some keyword into address bar and chose enable to see pdf by Chrome .
For now , there is no complain about Chrome .

The doctor looks careful and probably creditable but since I am for now translating one docdor 's book which criticize doctors who are easily `` putting their patients on chemicals `` I am a bit nervous .
But I have no choice for my clean feet in a short term .
I will faithfully follow his instruction first .
The public health care insurance took charge way more than half of the total medicine bill .
Anyways , I hope this summer I can wear fabulous sandals to boast cute toes and clean feet .

The enigmas clears up one by one , and by the end of the chapter , I found myself being able to understand the example code on the beginning .
This book does not begin with mundane stuff , ' if - else statement ' , ' using a list ' , ' for loop ' and the like .

I have ever tried to study Mandarin when I was in the jounior highschool .
Chinese - charactors are used in Mandarin and Japanese , so I thought learning Mandarin is a lot easier than learning any other languages .
Some of meaning of chinese - charactors in Mandarin and Japanese are same but some of things are not .
it made me complicated .
Although , Mandarin has four accents in one sound ( I ca n't explain about it crealy in English , try to understand ! ) .
These reason , I left from Mandarin in a week .
It 's should be great man ! `` .
I 'm sure that the time is for K things currently , but Taiwan has many appeals ; like cultures ( especially for young people ) , foods and traditions .
So , how can I start to learning Mandarin first ?

I 'm housewife , so it 's convinient for me to do such a short time job .
Actually , I have no purpose to study English hard , so if I got some job which required some English skill , I could improve my English , I thought .
At interview ,
What 's is your weak poing in your job
Is it available for me to adjust your working time depending on students ' convenience ?
I was so upset when I was asked that , because I had no preperation for the job interview .
So I could n't pretend to be smart at all , I mean , I answerd it just honestly .
but someone around me always tell me that they can feel at ease after talking with me .
Because probably I can listen to them very well , that 's why they can
feel relax with me .
I 'm eager to do something which I ' m interested in , but sometimes I lost my motivation rapidly .
I 'm not gon na go abroad , I have no plan to live abroad , because I 'm housewife , It 's difficult for me so far .

Essay : Do you agree with making the smoking area ?

Question : The university is considering making the smoking area in the university .
I agree that make the smoking area and restrict smokers to smoke only there .

Today 's my topic is about dance .
Does everyone know any about dance ? ?
Nowaday dancing has a lots of style so we can tell the difference between `` old school `` and `` new school `` about dancing .
Old school has many popular style that you may have ever heard before .
`` Breakin `` , `` Poppin `` , `` Lockin `` and `` Hip - Hop `` are old school dance which style became famous in 1970 's - 1980 's .
Poppin is my best dancing style whch movements are so freaky .
I recomended you to watch this dance if you interested in it or you have never watched it .
New school dance became popular in 1990 's .
I do n't know about these because these style 's history is not much as deep as old school , so I just know the concept that `` make own moves whatever you like `` .
If anybody wants to know more about dance , coment me please !

There is a host of factors lead to job satisfaction .
Provided that a person worked in a noisy and cramped room , it is less likely to satisfy his job ; therefore , good environment is required .
The employers could equip their office with sophisticated facilities as possible as they can , in order to afford workers comfort and convenient .
There is no need for the boss to look his staffs over their shoulders .
In addition , corporations can , every so often , organize some creational activities , which may let the worker feel a sense of belonging .
It is generally accepted that people want to be recognized on their work .
In this case , these employees would feel enthusiastic and motivated without feeling their work monotonous .
When an individual perform exceptionally on his work , the rewarding would inspire him to be more diligent , and this , in turn , will benefit the company .
Although job satisfaction is so significant , it is unrealistic to have all workers feel satisfactory on their work .
However , measures should be taken to achieve this goal , getting more people have job satisfaction as possible as we can .
The existing practicable and effectual actions should be carried out while new steps are being taken in to consideration seriously .

It is embarrassed to say , I 'd never recognized this fault .
One day a lady laughed after I said this phrase .
I could n't catch her but I wondered why she laughed , of course .
I asked my Canadian friends about the reason .
They said , `` Maybe she said , do you want my cell phone number ?
Your question is exactly weird . ``
Now , instead of that , I say `` Can you please enter ( or put ) your number ? `` I am very afraid that there are another wrong sentences I insist they are correct .
As if the sentence is correct for the grammar , to be wrong possibly occur when I use that sentence in the wrong situation .
But I could notice the wrong way .
That thinking makes me speak low .
I know it 's not good habit .
By the way , `` could I have your signature on it ? `` ( as pointing the receipt ) This is correct , is n't it ? ?

I rent a room at Indian 's house , and there is an Indonesian maid .
Now she is really stuck because the landlord has n't allowed her to contact her family in Indonesia since she came here .
I do n't understand the maid system ( I think honestly that hiring maid itself is against the human right even if both hope so ) .
It 's quite ridiculous to prohibit her to call , mail , have a mobile phone even though I have no idea about Indian way of thinking or their common sence ( or this is not about Indian people but just my landlord indivisual ) .
I can have her use my phone or PC , but is it no good ?
I do n't understand why it is a problem to her contact her family .
Besides my landlord ca n't speak English at all and I ca n't Tamil either .
I do n't like any trouble , but should I do something for her ? ?

The reason of study English
I have been studying English for 6 month .
I want to take a score 6 . 0 by IELTS .
My writing score is 4 . 5 , and I have to study more .
If I took the score 6 . 0 , I could go to OET preparation school in Sydney .
I want to know how I can write a English essay in fluency .
Moreover , the more one learns the easier he finds it to acquire good learning skills .
And the more he practises his learning style the quicker he learns .
Personally I have been learning English since early childhood .
In those days all I wanted was just to know a few words so that to say just a few sentences in class .
My first authentic resources were ' Three Men in a Boat ' , ' The Godfather ' , ' Great Gatsby ' , ' How to Steal a Million ' , ' ' Snow White and Seven Dwarfs ' .
Many years have passed since that time .
I 'm still learning English .
Now that I am a grownup and know what my learning style actually is , I can learn a great deal more at a time .
Having been motivated in high school I think I can hardly stop learning now as I believe there is no end mastering English .
Thanks for yout help to improve this passage .
The man , however , sued his ex - girlfriend and filed a claim for all the gifts he gave , which includes 5 packs of dumpling , bug zapper , birthday cakes , SPA fare , high - speed train tickets and vitamin .
Besides , he also asked for medical fee and mental compensation , which amounts to 10000USD .
The judge thinks that the man went overboard and gifts - claiming was without merit so he repealed his filing .
If I had claimed the whole gifts I sent to the girl I had a crush on , I would have an iphone4 plus PS3 now .
Not only did they cut the tie but also had retaliation against each other .
There 's nothing more ironic than it !
I had worked for an American company for 4 years before I left work due to maternity .

It 's great summer vacation for me .
After 2 - week vacation in Tokyo I came back to my apartment house in America .
A Japanese woman who lives in the room just under my room came up to greet me .
Woman ; Welcome back !
I have a good news and a bad news for you !
Momoko : Well , let me hear the good news first .
And what 's the bad news . . .
Woman : It 's a long , mysterious story . . .
Woman : While you were away , I realized peculiar sound in the kitchen during the night .
Momoko : Poltergeist !
One night I heard the sound in the cabinet under the sink .
I put my ear on the door of the cabinet and listened .
It sounded like something was scratching the bag containing rice .
Woman : No !
I banged on the cabinet door , hoping that the scratching sound would stop . . .
and it stopped .
Woman : Yes , and . . .
there were a few scratches and bites on the thick paper bag of rice .
I showed the bag to the apartment owner and . . .
Woman ; He handed me this . . .
What shoud I do if a rat , mistakingly eating the poison and suffering , jumps from the kitchen cabinet ?
What should I d if I find a dead rat in the cabinet ?

Today is the day that Japanese suffered from Nuclear weapon in Hiroshima 65 years ago .
The ceremony about mourning the pople who were died in this weapon has been held every year , but in this year it is so historical because the representatives from western countories participated in this ceremony , especialy United States .
This change is due to the speach by President Obama in Berlin .
And what I was most impressed is that the cecretary general Mr .
Ban Ki - moon made some speach storongly about a necessary of storong will to the achievement of world peace without Nuclear weapon .
I think he may have some mixed feelings because many Japanese made cruel actings and behavior to people in the Korean Peninsula , and he might be blamed by some Korean who do n't like Japanese .
But he visited and made some speaches in japan over these feelings and background .
Which way is better to tip waiter and waitress ?
I 'm not sure how to tip at restaulant because I 've just moved in America and my mother country Japan does n't have such a custom .
Do you think which way is better ?

I think they do n't notice the word they sad will hurt someone important sometime .
They do n't know how much it pain someone .

I have decided to post voice journals here , because there is only so many oppotunities to speak English in my usual life .
Sometimes , I talk to him on the internet , but he studies Japanese hard so I always end up speaking in Japanese as I talk to him .
I have posted some video blogs that I spoke in English on YouTube before .
But , I could not post a lot , because there was nothing to tell especially when I would try to post something every time .
But , Lang - 8 is different from YouTube , because people can correct my English I wrote .
I appreciate those corrections so far by you all , and thank you for listening to this journal .

I 'm now preparing for the entrance exam of the graduate school .
By the end of this June , I 've been working as a banker .
But I quit it and decided to enter the graduate course .
I do n't have any regret against what I decided to do .
But I 'm very anxious about whether I can get a new job after I 'll leave there .
It 's because new undergraduates have more chances to be hunted by Japanese companies .
A long time ago , when I learn the swimming in the swimming pool ,
Since I was a very young child , I used to swim at the shallow lane .
Unexpectly , I was falled into deep lane that it was used only adult .
I struggled to get out deep water and I ended up escaping the water .
After I was almost drowned ,
I have been scary about deep water , swimming , pool .
But recently , I have been learned a swimming in the swimming pool .
If everybody challenged against own fear , it could overcome the fear .

I did n't think it 'd force me to stay up late this time at first , because there is only 1hour time difference between China and Japan .
Our house is 950 square feet , so it is small cute white house .

Actually I had n't been able to sleep well lately ( I do n't know why . . .
maybe it 's because of word cup ? ? ) , anyway I was stayed up until after midnight .
It 's kind of annoying , and of course I counted sheep but did n't work .
Then I just turnd on fan , took a time and relaxed . . .
then next moment , I was woken up by sunshine .
I just realize it was 10am and I would be late .
In Japan , after having graduated from a college , most of japansese students work immediatly , then , stay in the company at least for 3 to 5 years .
Eventually most japanese fresh - graduated employees wind up staying there for couple of years even if they have lost the interest of working in that company .
In fact , I had worked there for several years , however I rarely saw people who worked for more than 2 years .
I had about 20 staff ( subordinates ? ) under my position .
but only 1 or 2 persons had remained for 2 years in the company , the rest just left there within 1 year .
I did work out with my friend today .
and then I watched super ball ! !
at that time , It stayed my friend , her boyfriend , boyfriend 's friends and I .
I could n't speak with everyone but I think It was really good experience for me .
I wanna do my best before go back to Japan !
Today , my classmates gave me the plums from his yard .
He is a trilingual .
He asked me that why I had n't attended class on last Wednesday .

My answer was `` YAP `` and then he drove me to a Vietnamese grocery .
While I took around in the Vietanmese mom - and - pop store , he petted my shoulder and said , `` Here you go , a Vietnamese sandwhich . ``
In the recess today , he still pulled me to the corner again and asked me if I wanted the pulms and vegetables .
He knows that I uaually cooked on my own to save money .
At the monent , I almost bursted into tears .
It is sure that my TOEIC score is very row .
However I like to watch some English movie and talk to Englishman ,
What should I do to grow my English skills ?
And I read some books in English evey - day .
I know I need make an effort .
Recently , a Japanese company declare official language is English .
They should use English evey sityation .
If I am in the employ of this company , should I hand in my resigna - tion ?
This sentence explains my medical work .
The reason why we selected prostate cancer samples from radical prostatectomy is that between 1997 and 2004 at our hospital the 48 . 5 % ( 99 / 205 ) of surgery were performed following neo - ajuvant hormonal therapy .
Recently , Most surgery are performed without neo - ajuvant hormonal therapy at our hospital .
Therefore , the analyses of sample in radical prostatectomy without neo - ajuvant hormonal therapy are currently ongoing .
It took for 90 minutes .
It was hard a bit but I enjoyed it .
I think I have a good balance because I tryed surfing sometimes .
We sweated all over ! !
I love to sweat by sports .
Tonight I saw the film version of `` The Phantom of Opera `` at home , which is played on TV for almost three hours ! ! !
But its music is really fantastic , the leading actress ' voice deeply appealed to me .
Their beautiful voice have impressed me a lot , surely like a haunting melody in my mind .
I was truly touched by the sentimental movie , especially when the phantom let Christine and Raoul go , I can not help but shed my tears .
I sympathize with the phantom a lot though he is sometimes too cruel , but I think it 's the society that made him crazy .
How solitude he was ! ! !
It 's a pity that he can not bring his talent into full play .
He is a genius !
Well , since I will go to NY this summer vacation , I expect to go to Broadway for watching this show on the scene .
I got the new one .
Tonight , I am painting .
I 've already do my job .
I was really excited , because I was no idea how should I get the new one .
But now , I am painting my new art work .
I am thinking around the space .
This space is full of power , because everyone can see but others not just we can see .

The Phillies Wins !
At first , I did n't want to watch the game because of my study .
The Phillies led most of the game , so I was n't worried very much and strongly believed they won .
However , in the eighth inning , the situation changed .
I found the Rockies led .
In the ninth inning , Ryan Howard hit and the score 4 - 4 .
The score eventually turned 5 - 4 in the top of ninth .
I ca n't take my eyes off the Postseason .
Halloweem party
yesterday , I went to Halloween party of school .
And I thought one thing , it is that how different bitween japanese and others .
When I went to party , everyone made up and wore costume that is Dracula , Zombi and Vampire .
it was so funny and amazing because I 've never seen like this party when I stayed Japan .
Then , we were dancing in a room .
but most Japanese could n't do .
I know why , normaly we could n't have opportunity that we do dancing in Japan .
And one more reason is our personality , generally Japanese is shy , quiet and unconfident , it 's only my opinipn .
Espesialy , we are quite unconfident , pessimistic and negative .
I think these are one of personaity problem and it cause that we are afraid failure .
Actually it dipends on person .
I mean Japanese need to have confident and courage .
I believe that this is interesting for someone who are leaning Japanese because I will compare the life in US with that in Japan .
Every professors has a big priority to their courses and they try to improve the quality of their classes .
On the other hand , Japanese university provides more opportunities for research .
This difference causes by the way to evaluate university .
And , these rankings are considered as very important issues .
In turn , there is less ranking about universities in Japan .
I finally noticed working as a day laborer does n't suit me .
If I work little by little after school weekdays , I can cope with studying and part time job .
Even though I 've worked as a day laborer for two years , I 'm through doing !

And I try to grow up my hair by long .
When my hair will cure , I dye them again .
I are familiar with its hair color .
Because black hair was ago entering University .
But I do n't like black hair because I think the black hair is so dark and the face does n't look like healthy .
I changed the topic .
It was so nice time .
Recently my work is busy so I could n't study hard because I do n't have a free time . . .
but I want to keep writing journal ! !
I think this work is good result one day .
Teacher : OK , would you please see these two sheets ?
One is your son 's , and the other is the one of the student sitting next .
Father : So what ?
Do you judge that my son cheated because both of them wrote the right answer ?
Question 2 , `` Where was the port that the Blanck Ships ( called the ' Kurofune ' in Japanese .
They were the first mission from US and shocked Japanese people at the time politically and culturally . ) called at ? `` .
There are many , many ports in Japan .
And my son and the student might happen to write the same wrong answer .
My son wrote the right answer , and the student cheated .
I live in west - japan where not affected aftermath of earthquake disaster .
What will happen to my life and where japan will go ?
Normal life is priceless , I found after things happened .
But , I think , now , It is time to make a effect to spend life as usual as possible .
To the contrary , what I can do is carrying out my responsibility for around me , family , community , to be able to spend their life each other .
For japan , for me , for my children 's generation .
Today is a beautiful day is n't it .
Now I feel comfortable season of new green leaves in Japan .
Some day , I want to talk with my friend in Spanish and I hope to be going good at them sooner .
- Since the surgery can cause respiratory complications , sleep apnea , snoring , mouth breathing , the student nurse should focus on assessing respiratory system .
- The patient has a risk of infection , the student nurse should check there is elevation of WBC , assess the incision site , and assess the patient has a fever .
- Assess there is any bleeding .
Since the patient had a surgery on October 4th , the pain may increase , so it is really import to assess pain .
( respiratory rate , deep , and lung sound )
- Encourage to drink .
The surgery may make the patient feel difficult to swallow , so it is important to prevent dehydration .
- Inform patient and family member about the potential complications
- Teach patient and family member post care of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy
I spend so much time to do this things .
I am almost stressed out with English and some stuff .
People enjoy a kind of party on that boat .

I did n't know what Genpets are until yesterday , when one of my friends in the English course had an extra presentation - - a punishment for letting her mobile ring during the course - - and this presentation was about Genpets .
Color coding is what determines the type of the personality , such that ;
Genpet Red : Athletic and energetic
There life span is 2 to 3 years .
So the question is : What do you think of the idea of these Genpets ?
and would you like to purchase one of them ?
I am taking a profound interest in workers in Asia .
Asia has a experience to be colonized by European Imperialists for a long time .
Korea was a colony of Japan for 35 years , too .
During colonization , not only invaders destroyed national traits and the culture but also over exploited people 's labor .
Besides that , Asia countries were deprived from opportunities of modernization by invaders .
Furthermore people are still suffering from political corruption , polarization of wealth , widespread poverty .
I 'd like to work for workers and women who have a hard time in Asia .
I am sure that experiences of South Korea will help them since Korea went through colonization , military dictatorship , polarization of wealth , political corruption etc .
Anyway , let me finish my word saying my real dream .
I am sorry that I replied your comments late and I did not write my diary everyday .
I will go back to Ohio 10th April .
Lately , a problem appeared .
Materials of daily entries are out of stock !
I have always looked around something interesting for this site , and collected incidents that often happen to us .
I wanted to find differences of feelings among countries .
I ca n't realize such materials for entries any longer .
I have n't came across this slump for that long time .
But it is only on the surface and some people have bad habits in their job and their relationships in interiorly .
They always pretend fine persons but some people know their dirty mind .
I also hate them because they are always doing injustice .
We are always gotten angry from them .
I want to that they will leave as soon as possible .
It is national holiday in Japan .
I think that spend watch the movies or play tennis on me .
I 'm getting used to the weather here , but the thing I ca n't still get used to is the time while the sun rises in summer .
It could rise from 5am to 9pm .
It 's a little strange for me , it 's not dark during the supper time , and also we can eat dinner outside ! !
I 'm crazy about for it .
It 's been long time to visit here .
Hi , all of my friends who meet here .
I have troubles with me and my roommate .
Recently , I 've felt something wrong to be with my life day by day .
In the truth , I feel confused with my dream what to do .
I 've got burdens on my shoulders .
For me , I dreamed to become a social welfare not that long ago ,
I think and think and think , what to do in the future .
But on the sadely , still I ca n't stride throughout what I gon na do for my happines .
He loves and addict to exercise at the health club and therefore , he 's been the front of his laptop at his desk .
He want to have a cake and eat it too all the times .
That 's way he 's always have a meal beyound midnight and talk me eat together .
His gobble 's sound makes me not to sleep early and get crazily .
How should I tell him about my difficulty .
I 'm on the third grade in middle school .
So , I and my classmates had to clean our classroom and dress our uniforms neatly .
Korean schools have quite strict rules about costume and hair .
Fortunately , I was n't pointed out my costume . ( If so , we would get bad point . )
I hope that Korean schools are more free like foeign schools .
It is Day off today
I studayed English from 7 to 9 in this mornning .
I start to study since last January .
I am trying to write using recently learned expressions .
It is helpful to remember expressions .
For the most part , all of them seem as if they are not correct owing to lacking in practices .
If you have enough trying , your command of a foreign language you learn will be guaranteed high level .
At least I expect so .
For aforementioned approach I recommend you make index cards as a vocabulary list .
When you learn something new , write down on a card .
And then , writing a diary with your second language , pick up some card from the deck to apply new one to your trying .
How about my method of learning a new sentence ?
Do n't hesitate about starting .
And , Be patient with the time needed to brush your skill up .
Ah , One more thing .
I almost forget to say this , by far the most important tip .
With all mentioned ways , the most significant hint is remained .
The hint is you need Lang - 8 friends helping with their native tongue but also your foreign language .
Have a nice day , my friends .
I get muscular pain .
Yesterday , I started new activty , Capoeira !
I like sport and I regularly go to sportgym and train .
Good friend
My good friend yesterday was came back Taiwan from Japan ,
and she goes to Japan playing for two months , so good > <
so she made an appointment with me ,
I do n't know where we could go ,
and the weather was very very hot ! ! ! > <
so ~ ~ I decided went to eat afternoon tea again ! !
but because her school is far from me ,
so we very rarely to see each other > <
but when we meat each other ,
it was just like not seen in two days .
I feel so miraculous , but I like that feeling = )
I hope we can be very long long time 's good friend .
It is little difficult for me to go to bed .
I have had dream for four days .
For example , someone who has knife chased me in the dream ,
Last weekend , I went to the movie theater to see the film of the Harry Potter 's last story .
It was the Lady 's day , so I could watch the film only for 1000 yen .
In Japan , it costs a lot to see the movie in the theater compared to the foreign theaters .
When I tried to buy the ticket for the film , I wss recommended by a clerk to watch the 3D version , but I heard from my friends that some people tend to feel sick while watching 3D films .
Especially , the last scene of the film , the battle between the Harry and Voldemote was impressive !
I think that I am kinda rare person on this Lang - 8 'cause I do n't think there are so many Japanese people here .
I could n't be bothered to work nowadays , so I skipped my job .
I am a sales person , so it is okay since I got kinda many contract nowadays . ( I am the secoud peoson who sales stuff a lot . )
I like : you tube , facebook , mixi , skype , call of duty , PES , drinking , football , listening songs . .
as you can see , I am kinda Japanese geek
I do n't keen on studying English language .
I dolike to hear English sounds but this is like my hobby not to study .
I 'm doing an internship but think about quitting it .
I 'm working for an print operate office .
I mainly do a simple , repeative work like anyone can does .
But it can often be responsibility .
While my coworker , who entered the office after about 2 weeks than me , does better works .
Sorry this entry is negative much ; ;
We 're going to move another building next week so today we all cowokers were packing a lot of stuff .
I took some pictures with my coworkers as a memory .
Anyway I made my wish and some good pictures .
I 'm a kind of fun - loving person , I love to think happy thoughts all the time .
Because I have no good memories in my childhood .
After I hang out with my boyfriend since last August , I took a lot of pictures with him .
We went to a lot of places and every time I looked back at my pictures , I feel so warm in my heart .
Radio gymnastic
Do you know the radio gymnastic ?

That 's OK , but I always annoyed with little things like this . . .

It was so sad things to think about the `` death `` , but we want Pome if we had a chance to keep .
Nowadays , dogs and cats are sold by the internet .

( You may ask what is my wishing for .

My birthday 16 day April
My birthday 16 day April ! Have who can bless
Do n't know how to spend my time ! !
Today , I took paid vacation .
Because , typhoon came to Japan on today .
But , typhoon passed Japan early morning .
So , I was leisure .
And I go to a library .
I borrow the novel `` Green mile `` witten by Stephen Edwin King .
I do n't know I will finish reading this novel .
But , I try to reading !
There was something happened in my house , I just feel not comfortable .
Whatever my roomates and I will solve that .
This time I know the person that who can be friend or just have diatance .
I held a wedding ceremony about 1month ago .
Many friends and relatives came our wedding ceremony .
I told my parent and my wife to thanks .
so I thought the wedding ceremony became special .
And I never forget that special day .
Our couple is happy !
I 'm sorry about it .
The Japanese is basically modest .
Because Japanese signify respect other party .
And Japanese were agricultural people ancient times ,
Japanese had been grown by nature .
It growed japanese spirit that respected nature .
This is the first diary for me .
By the way , what are you gon na do at the spring vacation ?
Well , I 'm gon na go to Taiwan at the spring vacation .
My brother staying to make a business trip in Taiwan for three months .
So I 'm gon na go to Taiwan by using the period .
Of course , I 'm gon na stay at the my brother 's house .
I 'm studying Chinese a little now 'cause it 's a spring vacation soon .
My emotion
I think I am a calm person but when I engaged in hard talk with my friend , I lost my ability to control my feelings and could n't say anything and felt my mind and thinking were stopped from working .
I know I can express about my feeling with a good manner if I was calm but what I can do with my emotions .
I try to compose the songs with English lyrics and if my mistakes are corrected I 'll greatly appreciate .
= The child 's no more =
Whose justification will help you not to feel lone ,
Without fear of future
I 'll step in opened door
so , today I 'll introduce myself .
My home town is very small and surrounded mountains which is located in center of Japan .
I grown up seeing the Japanese Alps in the distance from my house .
I lived with my parents , elder sister who is married and growing up her son and daughter with her hasband .
we have one very cute white cat .
On weekend , I enjoy cooking , swimming in the pool , practicing Yoga in my room , reading books .
and I 'm learning japanese tea celemony once in a week .
I 'm interested in japanese traditional culture , such as tea celemony , kimono , japanese flower arrangement .
Nowadays these are something we pay money to learn for many japanese .
Some people wear kimono often or everyday ( example , who are obsessed in japanese culture , who learn / teach tea celemoney , japanese manner and japanese flower arrangements . . .
Though , many japanese do n't own their Kimono , rent and take service to be wore Kimono when we need .
We do n't do tea celemony in daily life except when our families or ourselves are famillier with it .
The reason why I 'm interested in japanese culture is that we need to have skills well balanced in many janles .
And , we become eager to learn every janle equally .
when I learn tea celemoney , we became eager to learn good handwriting , languages , behaviour , flower arrangement .
whe I learn martial arts , I became eager to learn behaviour .
It 's not necessary to these leveles are excellent .
the important is that we have skills equally in many janle .
as a begineer , you need to have every skilles at beginner 's level .
if you go intermidiate in one janle , you need to have skills which is better than beginners also in other janle .
I think Japanese traditional culture has enomous things more than we can learn and understand through whole our life .
I will try writing about these things I learnd .
As an Engineer , I 'm interested in medical and technology .
I hope I can make friends who have interested in these topics , and practice talking and discussing in English .
Thank you for reading long introduction written in poor English .
Dec 10th : Sherk 3
I had seen ' Sherk 3 ' on TV tonight .
It was the first time to see the movie .
I was little tired because it was so busy .
I ate an pears and drink something hot .
Hmm , I 'm falling sleep .
Recently , I bought a iPod Touch . because , that way English study 's more interesting .
In fact , This is very usefull and cool design .
But , One problem is the battery has decreased in an instant .
by the way , I like watching japanese animation movies .
this entry is about what I talked about with my friend today :
what should I do while I am a collage student ( in other words , before I graduate and work ) . . . ?
I did an internship in Japan for 6 months and it was killing me .
I was like this : I worked from 8am to 10pm 6days a week , and I slept a whole day on Sun because I usually didnt sleep enough and felt so sleepy everyday .
then Mon came and I worked so hard for such a long time on Mon to Sat . . .
I seriously didnt have any time and energy for investing in myself in the future .
im crazy about books and usually read everyday basically FOR FUN .
BUT I even couldnt do that during the period .
how the hell could I study something that will be needed for myself in the future ?
we , students , dont have money .
but we have plenty of time .
of course I have to say students are also busy with study , part time job or whatever .
but compared to people working , we are absolutely so free .
so what I wanna do in a college is something which I have to spend so much time to acquire it .
so far I came up with 3 things .
seriously I think that if I study these things before I graduate and prepare myself for the future , my life will change in a good way .
id like to explain more details about those 3 things but now I have to study for the exam which will be the most difficult ever ( in fact , its killing me ! ! !
I have so many things to do ) .
My U . K . 's memory
My stomachache just came from why the food were not suitable for me after all , I could n't enjoy the travel .
I 'll never forget that travel .
But she has lied down on the sofa .
And she had tears on her eyes .
Now she is sleeping on the sofa too .
I went to Yakiniku with 10 people who are from U .
We firstly try to talk as awkward in English .
And then , We start drinking and eating as much as we likes .
We drink a lot of grass of the beer , because they hold their liquor well .
There often be two beer mug on the table each person .
The sweadish man said ' ' Kampai ' ' each fifteen munits .
The most surprised one in that day was drinking Japanese Sake .
They have drunk cold Sake before , they said the taste was not good .
So , I checked them to who wants to drink with me , but nobody wants .
This time I ordered a warm sake bottle with two sake cups , and I will drink slowly un till we leave .
I poured my cup and another one for they can try to taste warm one .
We drink it , then , Nick said ' ' its taste good ' ' .
Then , he started to poured Sake for evry international students he gave one by one .
Just taked 5 munits , the Sake bottle was empty .
I was in dump surprised , because they drinked Sake at once poured by poured .
And then I realized that was last order .
So , Japanese should tell do not drink like drinking the tequila to foreigners before stats to drink the Sake .
If you forget this , you will see the only empty bottle in a short time .
I 've got a reason why she stoped a chat suddenly .
She gave me a message .
I attempted to write diary until today but I did n't make it because I was very busy .

I read a news which said that there are many Americans who like to use this social network , and that someone even took days off just to play it at home .
I also found that twitter is getting popular in Europe and America , and here in Taiwan many tech - geeks use plurk more .
Due to the Facebook has Chinese version , I spend some time registering it .
It is not what I though it would be , I originally though it was supposed to be a Blog interface or something like that .
To keep up with the technology is very important , something new to this era may be out - of - date in the upcoming future .

The shape of the Tengu was like a human beings but he had wings and could fly so we adopt it as a charactor and our good angel of filght squadron .
Actually , each squadron 's flight time of a year is assigned by our headquater .
After finishing year 's flight , we usually climb Mt hiko because we report the safely completion of year 's flight to the Tengu and pray for next year 's safety flight .

about smoking .
Before I wrote diary , I say some other things .
Last night , I suddently my eye is very red .
It is not good to my eyes .
I know this , but I ca n't control myself to use computer .
If I ca n't use computer a day , I will feel uncomfortable .
I probably addicted to the computer just like smoking .
I come to this training schools about 2 months .
I think now I can speak some English to someone else .
But last night 's topic I do n't know how to express .
Probably I am not interested in that topic or my vacubulary is not enough or my English is still very poor .
Last night , the teacher come from America .
he is a very handsome guy .
But I don 's think he teach students well .
we dicussed smoking .
the topic is very simple .
Indian parents teach their child smoking , but the children 's least age is 2 years old and smoke several cigarets a day .
It is usual in India .
A 2 years old child was smoking .
He was sophisticated like an adult and smoking 2 cigareets at the same time .
people were laughing around the children .
Parents should be responsible for their childen , pretect them and guide them to a right direction .
I do n't admit . . .
But I do n't want to admit I am a bottle - man .
I found out this website a few days ago , and I found it very helpful to me .
I want to improve my English and Thai language .
Thank u ! !
It has drizzled since last night .
However , a recent rainy season has a heavy rain , the thunder and the lightning .
In rain that falls quietly , it calms down my mind .
Today I talked on MSN with indean guy who I met through italki , which is international social networking service website .
It was said by him that my English pronounciation is really good , however , I could n't speak much .
I 'd like to get able to speak more .
3 ) about my future plan
A hay fever
It seems that I get a hay fever recently .
I go back from outside , I ca n't stop sneezing and a runny nose .
In Japan we eat OSECHI .
it is the special New Year 's food .
Recently there are a lot of people who buy OSECHI .
Many of Japanese foods is delicately and takes many time .
In husband 's parents family I must make one or two menu .
I think about it I become very nervous .
It is possible to increase the Japanese food in this year .
My daughter goes an international school ,
I have to communicate with her teachers and friends , parents in English .
I hope my English will get better if I could continue writting diary in English .
I 'm sorry I 'm slow in English .
If you can , I 'm really glad that you could check my dialy .
I think that this is a terrible high - pace ! !
S is a car - society , I do n't have to walk a lot whennever I go to somewhere .
hello ! !
I like read hero stories . . .
well I hope to improve my english so in that way I can success my goals ! ! . . .
Sometimes I get a cold after I am exposed to a crowed .
I take a medicine just in case .
Need a Refreshing
It is weekend , I have a plan to hang out with my friend .
I do n't want use my weekend to study or do the homework anymore .
Because I know that study too much makes me become sick and stressed .
After that we will go to the park to get fresh air .
I have part - time job every day except Monday .
I am a hall stuff in a restaurant .
Last night , it was a pretty busy day and hall stuffs could n't work properly .
So , I want to consider what was the cause and haw to prevent it .
There are three things I thought about .
Firstly , I think the main problems which can cause this trouble are an insufficiency of communication and state of mind .
I mean , we were too busy in both mentally and phisically to take time for others .
Secondly , the system to check what they ordered and what we serve is not efficient .
To solve these problems , I shoud relax a bit .
I mean , I should n't be tense at all time .
And then , try to let others be ease . *
The solution can be the stronger bond among the hall stuffs !
* I want to write , I wanna let them relax rather than be tense .
Like they work seriously but have space in their mind to take time to see others .
While I was there only for a week , I was astounded by the fact that American people are getting bigger and bigger every time I visit there .
It 's no wonder that President Obama is having a trouble on the health insurance policy .
I 've heard that Japanese genetically can not become so heavy because we become sick before putting too much fat .
I sat still on a plane for 12 hours on my way home , wondering whether the economy class seats are big enough for the chubby Americans and I was thankful that I had to leave the States after one year back in high school days because I put 10 pounds during my stay !
There are too much good food in America and they are very inexpensive !
`` It could be bad , If G20 meeting be scheduled three or four day not two day ``

We drove to Kyushu which takes 8hours with my husband 's sister ' whom I have to be nice ' and her Three kids , we saw them off , met my sister with her Three kids ( one of them is newly born , I had to take care ) at a small breathless apartment in Kumamoto , moved to Hakata to see my husband 's cousin with his Three kids ( which one of them crying in turns ) and took my sister with her Three kids to my parent 's house in Hiroshima .
I used to hate this rural area but after watching people living in big cities no matter how it is convenient , what a gorgeous house you live in , Shimane where I live in is the best place to live with children .
Fresh air , beautiful scenery , people are friendly . ( I took it for granted sometimes . )
The first date in my life
I did not expect that was the one I watched for the first date in my life .
After a graduation ceremony of junior high school , I called at her house by using yearbook which told me the adress .
My voice did not come out though I tried to say hard .
Now I watched it again , it was sure this movie has quite high quality , and it was not fault of this movie but of me that we did not have another date .
I like joke and Im funny , I think .
By the way , Im going to go NY next Feb to April , so , where is your recommended place ? ?
Please give me your idea ! ! !
Then , I was in Canada ( Vancouver ) during last August .

I played kendo in the class yesterday .
It is very tired and painful , but it is very interesting .
I began Lang - 8 yesterday . This is the draft of `` About me `` .
Since I began language exchange at `` Japan - guide .
com `` this February , I had very nice experience through the communication for teaching Japanese .
I have exchanged emails , corrected letters written in Japanese , helped assignments for the degree , given guidance how to learn hiragana for the first time , etc .
I am sure I can correct Japanese sentences you wrote , with explaining in english , if you are better at English than in Japanese .
Today , I also introduce Japanese culture .
Today 's topic is `` konbini ``
But Japanese convenience store has difference from any other country 's convenience stores .
In Japanese convenience store , you can buy anything you want like a variety of foods , grocery goods , tickets , stationeries , beverages and confectionery .
In addition to this , you can withdraw your savings , send your baggages by delivery service .
To be honest , I 've not been doing well these days .
My heart and mind are not well - balanced .
So I ca n't catch up myself and am taking such miserable feelings on my friends and family sometimes . . .
Do n't look back it wo n't do any good , Do n't look ahead you 'll be just misunderstood .
Does anybody know which hashtag is useful for everybody who wants to ask native Japanese or English - speakers about what you do n't know how to express in your second language .

When I 'm studying in there , I feel very comfortable .
Today 's class was kind of boring , but I could learn many grammars .

I do n't wanna overwork and I need have much more time to use my private time .
I think that we ca n't decide anything if there were too many choice .

As soon as we arrived in HaTay , my friends decided that it was too late to climbing mountain so they wanted to swim but I did n't .
Unluckily , we forgot the way to go home ( because the way to go different the way came back ) .
On the way came home , Lien ( my close friend ) realized that she lost her bag and she guessed she lost it when standing near a strange man .
There were many things in her bag ( her phone , money , watch . . ) .
I said with her I had never had a bad day before .
In the end , we came back home .

My friend got the ticket from his company and kindly invited me to go watch the game .
I have wanted to go watch the NBA since I came to the US . , so I was really excited before arriving the stadium .
The game was so exciting and also the seat was amazingly at a good position .
In fact , we sit just 2 rows behind cameramen .
That was very close from the game and players !
Later on , I noticed our tickets was worth $ 350 .
Although I have n't followed the NBA for long time , I liked watching the NBA when I was in junior high or high school .
I think the NBA was more popular than today .
I 'm wondering most of my Lang - 8 friends do n't remember that .
Anyway , last night I realized the NBA is still popular and might start watching the 76rs games .

He was talking about new features of it to his partner .
I could n't staring the beauthiful phone ,
that girl is staring it like crazy ``
I could n't play innocent so I asked him where did he get the beautiful phone .
`` I just lined up sweetie .
I just lined up since yesterday 's afternoon .

And also other customers were crush into it .
The man who has the iPhone4 is about 55 years old .
Though I am still not confident of my emglish speaking , I realized stronger and stornger that I should n't be afraid of making mistakes , and yes , as the words say . . `` Practice makes perfect `` , right ?
after the small group discussion , its surprising when someone came to me and told me `` your english is quite good ! `` . .
It 's so great to having this evening with those new friends and Ps .
Yeah , I think I am in a tough period on finding a job . . . . .
but there are still lots of things waiting me to experience .
I 'm a Chinese .
I have been learning English since sixth grade of elementary school , but still not very good .
At night of the day before yesterday I carelessly caught my foot on code , so my PC monitor fell down from the table .
As a result its screen broke down .

Last time I saw a one conversation between him and host family .
At that time I was stay living room with host .
We thought the `` sounds `` from his room and it 's looks like shaving sounds .
A couple of minutes later he appeared in living room and then we tried to teach for him .
Host told to him when you use a razor , you have to go wash room .
But he said `` I went to there !
`` As soon as he would be angry .
Of course host also angry because we knew that he told a lie .
In fact he never apologized to host .
We are not real family but host treat me as a brother .
I always be honestly because I living his house .
Why he had to told a lie ?
He usually does n't care about everything .
So we ca n't trust to him .
After this happening host said to me `` when you cook something , please cook for him . ``
Because if he use the stove he make a fire .
This meaning I can use the stove but he ca n't .
In this morning also happened something .
He always spread the water when he took a shower .
After that I had to clean it because I do n't like messy .
So I told him when you spread the water that you have to clean it .
I told to him how to clean .
But he usually use a paper .
This time I ask him .
I know he use paper everyday .
Why he ca n't tell a honestly .
Nowadays we have to think about natural asset .
Because he from Saudi Arabia .
I do n't want to discrimination .

What I can mantion to this topic is that I believe that this whole swine flu panic is steered by the media to improve the econimic situation .
In my opinion everything what happened was very artifitial .
It was created to improve the sale of medicine and to get a `` kick `` for the pharmacy development of vaccine .
A well as to show people the importance of vaccination and indirect to persuade people to buy the vaccine .
All over the world much more people die because of standard flu but no one makes from this fact such a panic as the media did in the case of swine flu .
It is located in about 3km from Mino Station .
Many people came there though I had thought there would be few because of chill .
And , a Japanese monkey appeared in front of us .
I saw for the first time a wild one .
Despite we forbidden to feed them , someone gave it a rice ball .
It isnt good .
For dinner , I ate Kaisendon , a ball of rice with some sea foods .
Today , let me tell you about my residencial town in Japan .
I have been in Hayama .
that is a famous seaside town in Kanagawa prefecture next to Tokyo .
Because Japanese royal family has a summer house in the town .
So the town try to keep the traditional landscape and try to keep crean .
It 's very small but beautiful nature town and a lot of retired persons .
Some Japanese office worker has dream to live in the town because the town does n't has a train station so it 's difficult to comute to business zone for example to Tokyo .
But I chose to live there with long comute time , I work in Shimbashi central of Tokyo .
The time to comute is 1h 40m .
I useally get on a train from Zushi station it 's in next town .
I spend the time reading news paper , listening English podcast , and sometimes sleeping .
A letter to brendan
Firstly , I saw some classmates make some mistakes in their diaries .
As known to us , the chinese hard to understand from some foreigner .
According to my family , he was 't suffered from pain so much .
One of them is to eat favourite japanese foods .
and I also eat ramen ( or Chinese noodle ) .
Ramen is originally from China but Japanese changed its taste so that japanese like it more .
Japanese local city has their own tastes .
Most of local ramen can be also eaten in Tokyo .
And we have lots of famous ramen restaurants in Japan .
Some of them are run as chains and some of them are local .
It may not so popular but I like it .
I went some of Yokohama ramen restaulants this time .
I will write down the list of good or famous ramen restaulants here .
Though I do n't know ramen is popular among foreign people , I think you should really try it when you come to japan .
I do n't know these restaurants have web sites written in English .
Finally , I atache the picture of ramen .
It was rain mixed with snow this morning in Tokyo .
It seems to become cold tomorrow .
However , the snow scene is loved .
today is my first join this ciub my english verybad so l hope to rise hope everyboy help me thanks

3 years ago , we had met at the cloth shop as a co - worker .

I used one piece of salmon , a potato , a carrot and half onion .
I fried onion with some ginger and dry red pepper at first .
Then I put potato and carrot and two spoons of curry sauce in the pot and fried all the ingredients a little bit .
After that , I added the fish and some milk in pot and stewed them for half an hour .
Finally , I placed some salt in it before the dish was ready .

It may be because of new year 's holidays , no , I kicked back too much during the holidays .

There was the phrase `` This better be good `` in a dialogue in my textbook .

Stuffing stomach by foods is important to suppress the sensation of hunger .
You might think that you gain body weight if you eat a lot .
Yes , you are right .
But if you eat the high volume of low calorie foods , you will be satisfied with them without long term weight gain .
For example cabbage and lettuce has only 23 and 15 kcal per 100 g , respectively .
Even if 2 kg ( ! ) of lettuce is consumed , you take only 300 kcal which is corresponding to 33 g of fat or the energy spent in just sitting for five fours .
Konjac and agar are primarily calorie - free and can be utilized to volume up diets as well as low calorie vegetables such as cabbage and lettuce .
Of course , if 2 kg foods or drinks are consumed , transient weight gain is also 2 kg .
This is emphasized in the episode of eating disorder ( ED ) patients , because they strongly feel fear to gain weight even if the weight gain is transient .
I think this one tastes good but my Europian freinds seem to do n't like it that much .

No matter anyone tells us , we started drinking from 5PM .
After 2 hours , We 've finished about 5 bottles of Soju which is a kind of Korean traditional alcohol .
Soju contains around 20 % of alcohol , which means it 's pretty strong .
That 's why all of us were badly drunk .
Afterwards , we went to China town in which we drank more alcohol .
I was totally blanked out so I could n't remember what was going on .
I must have dozed off for a while and then when I 've opened my eyes , I felt something strange .
Then I realized that I 'd passed 6 stations from where I was supposed to leave .
After all , I had to call my cousin for him to give me a ride .

As soon as I felt the quake , we went under the table to protect our heads and opened the front door and window to get escape route .
A lot of things felt down out of some shelves .
But I stopped them , because being outside was more dangerous than being at home in Tokyo in which there were so many buildings .
And my apartment is relatively new and earthquake - proof .
This is because safeguard of gas was working .
Fortunately , we can use water and electric power .
We ate instant needles boiling water by electric power .
Now we can use gas .

At last , I bought toilet paper and dry batteries this morning .
I hope to get back as we are .

World economy going down ? ?
Because Chinese government is rising a rate of interest , many small companies find it hard to borrow money .

the government did n't accept dissent of people because of their benefits .
I want to many people in the world know about this and have interest more and more is this .

Movies as Learning Medium
A debut movie from director Quentin Tarantino .
A group of men in tux is ordered to rob a diamond store .
Before doing the heist these men gathered at a round table playing card inside a small restaurant .
The characters started their chat discussing about madonna 's song `` Like A Virgin `` .
They tried to interpret the song .
in the end of discussion one by one they throw money in an upside down hat which is used to collected the money .
He criticizes about tipping .
He disagree to give tip to a waitress because society tells him to .
I agree with him because some rules in the society is made to please a group of people and this group is expecting other groups to agree with them .
Unless someone is part of the group the rule does n't apply .
Tarantino brilliantly criticize it on his movie through Mr .
Pink 's lines .
Beside Tarantino I love watching historical dramas or period movies .
Ironicly these kind of movies are n't always historically accurate .
For the sake of dramatic and artistic license the film makers make up the history of their own version .
After watching a historical movie I always check the Wikipedia to crosscheck the history information .
This is my first diary .
I start this service five minutes ago .
My wife and I watched Biohazard .
In the movie , the main character acted by Milla Jovovich try to help people who can not go out from a building because there are many undead out of the building .
We were really excited about the story but sometimes were not able to see the screen because there were some grotesque scenes .
After watching movie , we went to a book store and bought a book , which is about English alphabet training book for children .
Actually , my wife is now pregnant and we prepare for my children .
We came back to hometown and went to an Indian restaurant that we had never been to .
We were also astonished because , in Japan , there are not so many foreign restaurants which run over five years .
After eating , we promised that we come here again .
Please correct my diary .
Actually , I studied English in another way but I think it 's the most important thing that transmitting your thought in your aimed language .
And it 's better to get it corrected by native speakers and to study on it .
I realized again how comforting to be with them is .
It is also nice to be with my one - way - loved one but its relationship now strain my heart now a little .
Last Sunday I went on a date with her , but while I was with her I could n't be
what I am normally xD .
I want to come to feel relax when I am next to her ! !
I am a not lazy mother I think , but sometimes I do selfish .
so I have plenty of time to do anything I want .
The one is Seven Pounds
I still could n't describe these movies in English , but I had a good time , and I also got some new words and some phrases from the movies .
I might have been stuck in the house because of the snow if I woke up just a bit more later .
I came to my office before snowing heavily .
I think it 's lucky because it 'll be hard to come here because of snow tomorrow .
Snow couses many traffic delays here because it does n't often snow .
When I was a child , I got happy to see it snowed .
But it is a bit good for me that it snows because I can enjoy fantastic scenery .
`` Coming of spring ``
This morning , I was walking to a supermarket nearby my house .
While walking , I noticed leaves of trees were budding , and were preparing for the coming spring even though the weather was cold and tough .
That made me feel refreshed and happy , and I realized that I could n't afford to pay attention to these kind of little , but nice things these days .
I went to trip with teachers yesterday .
At Showa no machi was embodied showa period so I felt a good old memory rushed into my mind .
That 's way sometimes I want to give up but my conscience do n't let me do this even because I will need it while living here .
Today one question in English came to my mind :

I live with my housemate called Ena .
She imigrated from Korea to America 15 years ago .
When I came here in the USA , I was looking for housing .
So , I found Ena 's apartment on the internet .
After talking with her , I moved in this place .
When I arrived this apartment , I had forgotten she has 3 daughter called Mina , Tali and Mira .
I think Mina looks like her father , but I 'm not sure because she does n't look like Ena .
She is a bit stubborn , but very sweet , outgoing and smart .
Mira is 4 years old , but she is a very hard girl .
I have never met like this girl before .
Sometime she is very lovely when I give her some chocolates .
Sometime I 'm thinking like that .
If I refused to live her daughters , how change my life in San Francisco .

But now , I can feel comfortable and I knew how put myself into another 's place .

I went to see a lot of cherry trees to Osaka about seven years ago .
There is a pretty famous place to see them in Osaka and its name is ZOUHEIKYOKU .

That was really beautiful !
I 'd never known that there were so many kinds of cherry blossoms and I 'd never seen green ones in my life .
That was a very surprising to me .

It is generally believed that Japanese language does n't have articles .
Today I will review about usage of articles .
* I visited a town which is famous as a hot spring resort .
The town of this sentence is a one of famous towns .
In this case , a famous town exists only this one .

Whenever I see this word , I interpret as newspaper article .
Unfortunately I have n't finish all of my workload this week .
So I 'll be force to be on duty tomorrow .
I apologize to you for short notice
Today is the day of Japan 's lose of the battle against America .
On 15 , August , 1945 , Japan has lost the war against America .
I know it was fool of Japan to battle against America .
We could not win America because our technology was poor .
We must acknowledge our failure ; we lost the war .
But I believe we have another failure , too .
After the war , we have succeeded in growing the economy and we got better living standard .
We longed western life and our culture was westernized .
But then we have lost the IDENTITY and CULTURE of JAPAN .
You can imagine what is Japanese culture .
Of cource , Kabuki , Waka , Samurai , Yamato , Wabi Sabi and so on .
But Japanese , living today do n't watch Kabuki , sing Waka and Haiku , do n't watch Samurai .
Nowadays our lifestyle is all westenized , but we lost Japanese culture at the same time .
We are not Japanese ; more exactly , we are not what we used to be .
In ' LAst Samurai ' , which Tom Cruis featured , this idea was the subject .
Aftrer the war , we succeeden in economy , but we lost our culture .
We are not strong in economy anymore today .
I believe this is the biggest chance for Japanese to regain our identiyi and culture and to work together with each other .
it 's gorgeus .
Even though I bought it only 500 yen ( about $ 5 ) .
I ca n't believe its price is only small mounts .
in my opinion , famous French wine or something are not equal to their costs .
I think these are not value as much as selling price .
I love Australian & American too , there are many number of good wine capable of buying it from like me , having not too much money because so young .
Hey , please anyone tell me how good French wine is !
I usually listen to the English conversation program or watching English TV drama with PSP ( PSP stands for Play Station Portable ) on the train .

Acturally , I sat on the floor all night to write the blog , write the diary and ask friend how to transfer to English . ~ * * ~ It makes me scattered ~ like `` bustling street `` or `` press the bus bell `` .
@ @ I also change my job .
I forgot I wrote on last essay or not ? ?
My job is not lucky .
There is too much stores nearby .
There is an gold accessories next to my store and oppisited to Boost .
It 's a good way Boost is next to my store , so that some customers go to see my products when they are waiting for drinks or friends .
Or some customers might say somethings that means they want to have a discount .
And that kind of situation just like the business in market in my country .
I never think that will happen in other countries , especially in white people 's world .
In my opinion , they often buy products in stores directly and they do n't do bargain .
Bargain is too tired for me ~ XD
The end , I will work hard to my job .
My friend told me there is another job having more money to earn ! ! ! ~ ^ ^ ~ YA ~
In a dialogue I studied the other day , there was a sentence `` why , thank you . `` Someone praised a dress one woman was wearing .
I heard it for the first time and felt it strange .

Actually , I want to work and earn many .
Because I have a lot of things that I want to do and want to buy .
So today I go to interview .
Probably , you know .
I want to get a single - lens reflex camera for a long time .
Dreaming future is interesting .
Please cheer me !
Although noone corrected my diary , I did someone 's Japanese one .
It 's my first entry on lang - 8 .
And , I do n't even know what to write .
I 'm a 24 - year - old girl , born and raised in tiny suburb town in Japan .
lived with my family till 19 and left to the states to study whatever .
I was looking down on all typical college kids in Japan when I was 18 I guess .
souvenire . .
Next month , I 'll go to school in Boston for two weeks to study English , and visit to New York for 4 days for sightseeing .
I want to bring souvenir foe my host families .
I happened to know the song `` do n't know why `` that was sung by norah jones was also sung by an england singer whose name is `` joni keen ``
I felt there is a distinct difference between norah jones and joni keen while I was listen to it .
Especially the melody of piano is enough to get my baby erect .
I tried to look for the URL that contains this song for you all reading my article could be able to listen to .
but It 's hard to look for .
if you wanna listen to this song , send me a request to send by email .
Yes , title of my note is banal , but I can not invent nothing better
At first I want to tell about me some general facts .
I ` m a russian girl who live in the south of Russia , in Krasnodar area , in small town named Kropotkin .
I play guitar , watch anime ( yes , I ` m one of _ thete _ > _ > ) and learn English .
And I want to become an orientalist .
So I must pass English exam , but my standart of English knowledge not very hight .
And what can I tell you more ?
I can not think up anything now .
Did I make some mistakes in this text ?
It tasted good except stew
The viewpoint of speaker is all faculty should work outside relevant to the courses they teach .
One hand , professors who work outside will know which technology is more useful in factual projects .
There are so many theories in one academic field , for example , in sofrware engineering , java and c + + are both very useful programming languages .
Professors should pick one language to give the students more impression and conprehesion .
In China , c + + is used more frequently than java ; consequently , theachers should pay more attention to c + + .
Students who learn more useful technology will have a big adventage to find a job .
In addition , working outside will give professors another understanding of their own studying field .
In some circumstances , theories in textbooks are no ues in true life .
However , a professor who has working experience may not agree , because the faster one may cost much more than the normal one .
Instructions of the two kinds of teachers will not be the same ; and the later is more useful to students .
Nevertheless , not all courses are studied for using ; such as algebra , we may not find a job , which is just using it to work .
Moreover , it is better studied on campass , in lab , not in company .
There may not have a project to use it directly .
As a result , professors should not waste time in finding jobs .
As Bertuard Russell said , `` Experice without learning is better than learing without experience `` .
Every professor of academic courses that has opportunity to work outside ; the others may stay on campass .
For students ' future , universities should find more oppprtunities to give their professors .
In that way , both professors and students capacity will improve .
Finally , I 've finished my all work of the week today .
Although I 'm exhausted and sleepy , I 'm looking forward to go to my niece 's birthday party tomorrow .
Before the party , I 'll get enough sleep first .

This picture is of `` Chamusume `` who assist to serve cold green tea last year .
Yesterday there was a TV program on Al - Jazeerah - Children channel , in each episode of this program they host a child or teenager and let him lives his dream job , and meet someone works in the same job .
In yesterday episode they hosted a girl , she can speak Arabic and French , and she dreams to work as `` Interpreter `` , she met someone who work as `` Interpreter `` , a person who translates a speech from language to other instantly , this person works in United Nations and translates speeches in the sessions .
They show how this job is the most difficult job in translation , because the interpreter should listen , think of the meaning , speak and listen to the next sentence in the same time without any mistake .
They also show how this interpreter ca n't work more than 30 minutes , because his job need a lot of concentration , and he should take a rest every half hour .
The girl did a great job in translation , and I think she would be a good interpreter in future .
Today is December 11 , Saturday .
I make breakfast from now .
I 'm going to make a toast , a fried egg and a potato salad .
My two children like to crack an eggshell , but they sometimes fail and become sloppy .
It 's just 10days this year .
Recently , I 'm makeing a new year card design .
But , I could n't think nice design .
Because , next year is the tiger in chinese astrology .
By the way , I heard diffelent a new year some country .
JAPAN 's new year is on January .
China 's new year is on February .
India and Bangladesh new year are on April .
When are you comeing a new year at your country ?
Through writing it , I found that one of the name 's origin is related with the name of the job .
Today , I worked on graduation report .

I think `` The Name `` have some effect to people 's life .
So I 'm going to name my son in the future that . . .
I watched the rest of the `` 24 season 6 `` .
I 'll be able to catch up the latest season within this year .
In that drama , many short response are repeatedly used in conversation .
However , some phrases are very common in daily conversation , such as the phrases the civilians ' conversations before being involved in a crime , the phrases used in the meetings in the White House , and so on .
I found the phrase , `` What are you talking about ? `` in many scenes .
so I have been stuck at home .
It will be cold next three days .
I will stay at home these days with reading a book .
Our department hold a drinking party today .
I 'm a light dranker and I do n't like alcohol .
So , I do n't like a drinking party very well .
I learned some words and expressions yesterday and I 'll try to write a short sentence .
( 1 ) I went out with an umbrella in this morning because the weather forecast said that there would be the chance of showers in the evening .
( 3 ) To prove that the machine did n't have any defects , the engineer brought it to a halt for a three days and check it up thoroughly .
( 5 ) Who could anticipate such an increase in emission of pollutants .
( 6 ) You are eligible for getting a special discount provided you bring the card we sent last week until further notice .
Well , I 'll try to write a diary with more words than the twitter 's upper limit .
My twitter ID is `` akari131 `` for English followers .
It 's kunipen .
If you find me on twitter , please follow me .
Today I woke up with smile .
Today I had breakfast with spoon .
Today I took a bath with sop .
Today I went out with my parents , then diner with them .
Today I am very happy so much .
Recently I saw it .
Actully South Korea 's people usaully do n't interesting about North Korea .
Of corse , some people whoes NGO , human rights & church they are concerned about North Korea .
actully I did n't know about my blood relatives before I saw it .
I do n't think that the movie tells us to everything .
that 's going to far , to say the least . . .
Story is about a north korea 's man .
He had a family ; a wife , a kid .
Someday he 's wife had been sicking , but the man can find a medicine .
They just had just few corn flour and wife was dying .
So , he deciede that go to China and go back to North Korea after find some medicins .
The next story is . .
contents are good .
very sad story .
global news said to us ,
And the movie story is just one of a lot of people 's life .
I cried a few times when I was wacthing the movie .
Thinking about that if I was the man who has a sicking wife but ca n't find the medicine and food is dcreasing . . .
North Korea and China is very friendly
But , if north korean person is detected by public police of China or North Korea during a man pass border , 8 of 10 is died .
by goverment .
Even though people try to that escape north korea . . .
They bet whole thing because just live .
Big sale
I want summer jacket , so that I went to big sale with my wife .
I have been choosing many jackets , finally I bought two jackets .
One is a navy blue , and other one is a checkered .
I like these , so much .
My wife got many clothes which she likes .
We have had been having fun shopping today .
Last week , I went to a business trip in London .
It was snow .
In my business trip , I visited to Modern Tate , and I bought a T - shirts .
Some person saids that Britain food is not tasty .
But I do n't think so .
I in Tokyo have found a lot of matters by the Tohoku Kanto serious disaster .
1 , we can save electricity , therefore we had spend much power . ( For example , people of a family work in a same room so that they can save energy . )
2 , I have got chances to help my family , and communicating my family has grown up more than ever before .
3 , I found that my personal security have to protect by myself , but I should cooperate people
4 , A lot of information is confused us , thus I always have to think what I need an important information .
5 , I ` m more active , because the God helped us .
So I think I will face many big problems in the future , but I believe I can overcome .
Now , I ` m concerned about water problem : water in the Kanto region has gradually become contaminated by Fukushima Daiichi NPP .
Tokyo and some region is safe yet .
The climb
The song make me remember my life , my failth is shaking feels lost with no deriction .
But I got ta keep trying .
Have I told that I keep a cat ?
It 's really cute , show it to you my friend .
It 's very humid today no winds and want to do nothing
My skin is sticky all over
Can ' t wait !
Tonight is going to be a big night for Japan
Ca n't wait to watch , eithter ! !
I 'm looking forword that .
I worried about making friends .
I 'll always smile toorrow : )

My professor asked us to go to a few writing workshops and she would give us extra 5 points for every workshop we go .

Recently too busy , I havent a diary . . . . . .
A few days , I have a test .
And now I want everyone who can teach me english .
I 'll be cantonese , I can teach others speak cantonese .
Watching Movie Titled RED
Today I watched a movie , RED acted by Bruce Willis .
I understood RED as red at first , but RED stands for Retired Even Dangerous .
In other word , RED represents x - CIA agents who are still dangerous .
The movies acted by Bruce Willis never give disappointment to me .
RED was also very exciting ,
When I was young , high teenages , I liked horror movies .
As time goes by , I think personality has changed .
I wanna tell the charactor crucial thing .
There are many characters like I showed as above : Karaage Kun and characters for steamed meat buns , although all of them are not aware of their critical circumstances .
I often sit in front of the computer all day long , so there is a big problem for my eyes .
There is a new product Kindle which will probably solve my problem .
You can hold it just like a real book and the screen looks like the page of a book too .
But it cost over $ 200 .
That is way too high .
As a routine operation , I spent several hours as a receptionist , and at midnight , I looked around to see if something wrong had hapend .
On the Second Floor , it suddenly got darker than before !
When I approched the operating room , I heard
scared to hear and I quickly ran away from the place .
But the voice came after me as if it would tell something important to me .
The next day , I heard from someone that the voice was that of a deceased old lady who died from a terminal ill .
After she had a operation , she quikly died .
I correct myself : probably I dream everynight but I think I have dreamed only when I remember the dream .
I must say that many times what I live in the dream is connected with my real life , with my worries .
Maybe I 'm not a person with a lot of fantasy !
I do n't believe so much in the interpretation of dreams because nothing extremely strange happens . . . .
but , in the last one , firstly I dreamed I was inflating a bunch of balloons . .
then I remember I dreamed mice in my room .
When I got up next day I was in a daze .
Mice ? ? ? ?
In my room ? ? ?
It was the first time I dreamed about animals .
I made a search on google and the meaning was n't so positive .
So , regardless of religions , everyone is happy to say `` Merry Christmas ! ``
When you use water at a bathroom , do you turn a lever from a faucet to a shower ?
In Japan , we usually switch how to run water by turning a lever .
And I may not usually use a shower but a faucet .
To wash hands , face and so on .
Only when taking in a shower , I use the appliance .
Because of this , you will have a terrible accident if you forget returning the lever after using a shower .
You must suddenly take in a cold shower at the nape of your neck unintentionally .
It 's enough to wither you over a day .
Have you ever had the accident ?
Ten extra hands were very welcome . .
I 'm going to London about 10 hours during the school trips , yeah !
And still , I have this eery idea I forgot about something . . .
My friends go along with me .
Our youth hostel is situated two hours riding from London , so I 'll eat a lot away in my boredom .
And my best friend is quite sensitive of sugar , in the sense she gets really , really hyper and giggly .
Then she giggles of very silly things . . .
Emile Ratelband is nothing compared to her fit of laughters !
note : Emile Ratelband is a very hyper motivation trainer , who always yells ' ' Tsjaka ! ' ' .
XD I think he 'd drive me crazy when he talks to me for five minutes .
So six crazy girls polishing off a lot of sugar and chocolate is the perfect recipe to get in stitches , a couple of girls who are fooling around and a lot chatter , chatter and chatter !
This means I probably wo n't get a chance to thank you all for you comments , corrections or support .
The last day in 2009
Today is the last day in 2009 but I still need to take the class while some of my friends skip classes yesterday to go home and prepare count down activities .
In Taiwan , when `` count down `` coming almost every counties and cities will have big activities people will gather to watch singers ' performance .
Most fun part of count down must be firework performance .
Among all firework performance in Taiwan TAIPEI 101 is the most famous one because TAIPEI 101 is highest building in the world .
After count down firework performance will last 188 seconds .
When investing the stock market , we assmue that the crowds would be attracted by the outstanding company as time goes by .
American Idal , a TV program , is an good example .
The good news is the wisdom of crowds exactly exists .
For example , when estimating the number of the pinball in a jar or the murder rate in New York city , the errors between the crowds always be cancelled out by each other so that the average answer is often correct surprisly .
On the another side , the bad news is the wisdom of crowds is the phenomenon which is too week to be believed .
The difference between the smart and the blind crowds maybe just one pace .
The worse thing is the connection of modern life may makes us become more difficult to get the benifit from the wisdom of the crowds according to the new research showed by some Swiss scientists .
I watched hich school musicla at first , it 's very interested and powerful .
Nowaday , I feel sleepy feel in daytime friquentry .
Today , I nearly sleep inmidst of work .
Lack of sleep is bad affect on body , especially on brain .
My parents already died , so I live in my aunt 's home now .
But I 'll have to be back to my own home until I go to the USA .
There is no one . . .
It will be short time , but I may feel lonely .
I had lived alone for several years .
But I feel different when I live alone in the house I was born .
It is stylish form and good design .
I 'm having difficulty when I use it , however I take pleasure in use it .
A successful in lawsuit against nation and Pharmaceutical Company .
The plaintiff ( patients ) is a success in this lawsuit against nation and phrmaceutical company .
People who work at pharmaceutical industry , must be active in disclosing information for medical staff and patients .
My friend , whose pet name is Sunnyboy , invited me to stroll around the streets with him yesterday 4 PM .
He wanted to send a girl who has been having crush on her a purse , which has a exquisite figure illustrated in world map .
I ordered the butter and bacon pasta , asking the waitress if the chef could get rid of bacon for me for I am a vegetarian .
Finally , we came to a sports playground that has many indoor sport amenities , including baseball , basketball and soccer .
Here in Taiwan , it 's prevalent to play this indoor baseball , it took only $ 1US .
The pitching machine will pitches 30 balls in turn , whose speed can be chosen , and the players just take the bat to swing .
fm `` , but I have could n't write recent days .
One of the reason is that I do n't know my English is correct or not .
If your diary written in Japanese , I can check your Japanese ! !
My town has a local free magazine `` Explorer `` .
It 's very useful because it has an event schedule of my town and has some vouchers of restaurants .
It 's published every month , and I find it in the shopping mall , in restaurants and so on .
If you 'll find the local free magazine , you should get it .
I 'm not sure whether I would work at the current company , but the certain thing is that I would have the company life until 45 years old .
The best would be moving to other company offers better condition however I have few choices as a parent who are taking care of an young child .
The worst thing makes me hard is that my parents lives so far so that they ca n't care my child instead of me .
Currently I 'm hiring a babysitter to care of my child at work , sometimes I feel sorry not to care of her directly .
It would n't be possible to be happy in front of her who cries asking me not to go work .
Though , the reason I decided to continue to work is for better future .
Hope to have better house , earn more money , equip my chid with good educations , buy what I want and go for a trip . . .
I thought I did n't want big things however , it was n't true .
At first , I started to learn English for making a better career , but nowadays I just like saying what happens around me in English because there are someone who have warm concerns with kind corrections .
Either in Korean and in English , I always write things complexly .
It would be hard time this week because I attended a relative 's wedding so that I did n't take a rest last weekend .
I really want to have deep rest for a day . .
I do n't . .
I went to a school and met my friends .
After school I worked at part time job .
learn English from Movie ?
it 's been a long time I watch western movies .
but is n't it too exaggerated when speaking ?
I mean the words , vocabulary , way of speaking in the movies ,
they 're making movie , sometimes they pretend to be more emotional when acting , including speaking .
if I learn English speaking from movies , is it appropriate ?
I 'm first year student on master 's degree in SIT university .
I research in the Lab from morning to evening on a weekday .
but , I have a part - time job on Saturday and Sunday .
It is wedding assistant .
I wanna marry one day .
Today , I just spent my time for rest .

Celebrations to my friend !
And next my schedule will be change .
I just look for my goal .
Cheers for my life and I believe that = )
The older we become , the shorter we feel passing a year .
I think that the number of a year divided our years is diminishing .
For example , since I 'm 26 years old , a year divided my age is 1 / 26 .
On the other hand , one elderly person who is 80 years old , a year divided his age is 1 / 80 .
I think that the elderly person feels shorter a year than I in the above case .
Today I was very tired because I worked long time .
I will exercise a near by park when I go back home .
I must many things .
I am hard today .
It have been raining today .
I went to book store to buy some books .

The one is on my tongue , the another is near the corner of my lower lip .
When I begin to speak or eating something , I have a terrible pain there .
But I love Speaking and eating !
According to wikipedia , picky eater , person under stress or with a food allergy predisposed to have a oral ulcer .
I 'm not so picky eater , and many people say that it seems I hardly feel stress .
Is this course of the oral ulcers ?
Anyway , I hope to get cured sooner !
Long long ago there is a boy love you so long .
But with the steps of wind all things have gone .
How long I have to wait for seeing you again .
But in the end of fairy tale you eventually said `` bye - bye `` .
My English ability is going to worse and worse .
When I want to talk in English , I will think of Japanese into unconsciousness .
It 's so strange !
I have learned English since junior high school , but have learned Japanese just for two years .
To Chinese people , words of Japanese are easier than English .
In addition , in the college , my major is Japanese .
I use it every day , and in most class .
Our teachers are strict .
I want to promote my English ability .
Maybe reading an English article every day ?
More exactly I say , I made my set of snowbording buy by my father as my birthday ` s present .
I went to Kanda , Tokyo with my farther some days ago .
There was a town of sports goods and used books .
Many sports company buildings and a lot of small shops .
It is Novenver and winter will soon come !
So many shops sell snowbord and snowbord wear .
We went in the shops and watch many bords .
I asked to a shop man about which board is good function for me and good on me .
My tall is 165cm , so I should use a bord among 145 - 155cm .
I went back one of shops .
I found my faborite design .
I looked oposite side of bord .
I of couse looked vlue tag .
At last I found a good boad .
I took it .
When I said paper books in US were too expensive , my American friend said to me `` tell me about it ``
I did n't think that means exactly .
But it means `` I agree with you `` `` I already know that , I think so ``
I came back to Japan yesterday and I 'm in my parents ' house in Osaka .
I 've not written my entries since the past few days because I was n't able to use Internet in the hotel .
First of all , we went to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary .
We was able to see many famous kinds of animals in Australia such as koalas , kangaroos , wombats , and so on .
In particular , my daughter rejoiced to feed kangaroos .
On the second day , we went to the Moreton Island .
Morton Island is the biggest island made of sands in the worls so it has many deserts .
Besides , we enjoyed swimming in the sea , eating many kinds of dishes which were popular in Australia .
What we will never forget in the future is that we was able to feed the wild dolphins directly .
Why these people root for CG ?

I was planning to take teaching Japanese intensive class during summer .
So , if I could take the class , I would be going to get a certification as a Japanese teacher .
When I hear about that , I was so so so so shocked !
But , there 's nothing I can do for that .
I have to wait the next chance or just forget about it or what else ?
I always think about my future but never find nice idea .
On each stalls that called `` Goten - Yatai `` , the girls have on colorful costumes are playing music called `` Ohayashi `` .
They all are singing `` Kabuki - Bayashi `` same with the music which sang in `` Kabuki `` .
Women are sitting at the back of the girls and are playing `` Shamisen `` and `` Hu - e `` flutes .
All of them on the stalls are the women and the girls because `` Geisha `` was playing `` Ohayashi `` on the stall originally since ancient times .
Some of women are real `` Geisha `` still now .
What a beautiful music they play !
Why nobody would help me to correct my composition ? ? Maybe nobody can understand what I wrote ? Maybe my composition too boring ? What happened ? Who can tell me ? When the first time to write it , I 'm so exercting to looking forward someone would help me .
But it 's pity that no one correct my composition .
The company succeeded in making a special ink that disappears when its temperature gets over a certain degree and appears again when it is frozen .
So when you write with this pen , your handwritings look as if they are written with a ball point pen , but if you make a friction , you can erase as if it is written with a pencil .
You can not use it on the legal documents but for daily use it is very useful .
This pen was chosen as the top ten goods of the year when it first appeared on the market .
I put the link below .

My husband 's high school friend Hori - kun , my husband , and I went to Manly beach , which was near from Circular Quay and it took about 30 minutes by ferry .
Then I saw something blue like a thread in the water , and I thought it must be a fisher man 's fishing line .
So I was afraid that there might be a hook at the end of that something like a fishing line , and I thought that might hurt us .
So I avoided them .
When I noted that jellyfishes an elder lady spoke to me and she kindly told me that there was a alert of jellyfishes on that day .
I found I was stung by jellyfishes not only one but many parts of my body .
It 's already two weeks after jellyfishes stung me , but I still have scars on my legs .
Still I am translating my father 's book in English .
Lately , a species become extinct because of activity of human being .
Especially the habit of animals , plants and insects are destroyed .
These factor hit a life diversity .
Language exchange partner
I met my laguage exchange partner today .
She is same age as me and really good at Japanese .
It was impressing and inspired me a lot .
I used to speak Japnaese well but I ca n't now .
I realize that how easy laguages are forgetable .
Keep study is hard but really issential
But my thought was changed after seeing them that this series of the movie is a story about Anakin Skywalker , who is also Darth Vader .
The person who influenced me the most is my Japanese teacher .
In addition , he recommends me to read many books , not only Japanese literature but also foreigun one .
I can broden outlook on my life .
Now I would like to be a teacher like him and also I am taking a teaching corse .

Hard work start
So I went to the cafe .
I kike the ice coffee .
Brondon did n't go back home this weekend , I took 4 students .
He could n't stay with his group until before dinner .
And Kome changed the staff assignment .
So My schedule changed too .
Because She 'll take George 3days .
First , I do n't have patience to sit still peacefully and not to think the people who have made my life difficult .
I ate a salad as lunch .
And I ate a cold noodle as dinner .
I could n't wait the sun to rise .
Then by 2 am , my hands were shivering .
I could n't even draw a line straightly .
I almost passed off .
I eventually got some meet to eat , my body stopped feeling cold and stopped shaking .
Maybe I was born as a carnivora .
I eat grilled noodle for lunch .
It 's a very good taste .
But today work is very busy .
To be honest , when I came back home from Texas in the end of this May ,
my university was in the middle of semester , which means my school did n't let me register classes for this semester .
As long as my credits for graduation concerned , it 's okay : - ) I 've already taken classes enough to graduate , plus I 'm gon na go on to the 5th year for job hunting .
Thinking about job hunting makes me feel angsty . ) Now I 'm working for summer internship , I 'm not sure whether I can be an intern for some company though ( Because it 's seriously competitive and the chances of me getting into a company are really low .
As for the company I applied for , it was like there were more than 1000 applicants while only 4 or 5 people were hired . ) Many of my friends talk reluctantly and cryptically about what 's going on with their summer internships .
I try not to get my wish high but I 'll do my best : - ) I 'm gon na take an interview with a company I really wanna work for this summer .
I heard the information about this web site from my co - woker today .
I 'm very exciting to know this system , and looking foward to trying !
just like the time
As you know , recently , all over the world , there seems to be an economic crisis going on .
In Japan , prices of merchandise have been steadily increasing and employment seems to be gradually getting worse .
Many Japanese companies , especially exporters , their business results for last term were extremely bad .
That of my company was the same as that and I am not certain whether it can survive the next generation .
But it will have reached the limits in next year .
Manchester United is the big football club in England .
That 's my favoite team .
Since he joined Man U , he dedicated the team .
He left the team because he conflicted with Sir Alex who is the coach of Man U .
I hope Rooney would not go same way .
[ 2011 - 1 - 6 ] It 's funny day - 2
And I was requested to study English and Japanese at English village on the december 23 .
So I have been studying japanese and English step by step , and Finally I 'll have improved language ability about English and japanese .
keeping a dairy everyday is so exhausting
I want to improve my English , so I decided to write a journal everyday .
But I have few topics and my english is poor , therefore it is so difficult for me to keeping a dairy here .
But , of course I ca n't give up it already .
I 'm always surprised by people here with keeping thier journal in a foreign language .
I elnvy them .
Yeah , I know it 's meaningless .
SO I WILL KEEP A JOURNAL EVERYDAY AND I ' LL SURELY MASTER ENGLISH SOMEDAY LIKE THEM
Today , I went to International market , the library and the supermarket .
The sun light is getting more strong and more strong so I was wearing a hat with big brim .
Oh I want to go to Hawaii again .
The wind turned over the brim and I got a lot of sunlight . . .
I have a book I had to return so I went to the library .
The library would be clsed at 6 : 00 .
I hang out with my friends yesterday .
When we met , we didnt know where the `` budaezzigae `` restaurent was .
So we walked to look for the restaurent for an hour .
We found the restaurent in the end .
But I sufferd my friends by walking for an hour .
It 'll help us save our time .
I love to see many foreigner friends .
Hope to Communicate with them and have a happy time with them !
Someday , I stay in Australia in the future .
Its my dream .
On a couch
I 'm listening to my favorite music now .
Now playing is `` Come back home : by Two door cinema club ``
Time for relaxation . . . . .
What do you usually do for relaxing ?
I usually read a fashion magazine over listen to music .
That 's my favorite time .
Tomorrow will be Friday !
I want to the sea , to relax from work . . . .
I see it in front of my eyes all day . . .
There is the my son 's school festival yesterday .
My wife took part of a mini - car racing game .
While she was doing that , the other of my family had a lunch .
My American friend started his music blog !
Actually he is a Japanese learner , and we have been doing language exchanges for one and a half years every day over Skype .
I really think that keeping a blog in our learning language is a great idea because we can use the language daily .
In my case , I love receiving a comment from someone because it always encourages me and motivates me up for keeping blogs in English .
So , to announcing his blog , I have linked his music blog to two of my blogs today .
I also introduced his blog to some Japanese social network service sites that I have been using like mixi .
I posted his blog 's URL in my Japanese blog and on the wall of my Facebook .
I hope his blog will become world famous , and he will be able to get many International followers .
After we graduated our school , we had a long break and we finally started keeping in touch last year .
I think she almost changed my life because I do n't think I would have been the same me without the period .
she was living at her boyfriend 's mom 's house with him and his parents .
In my opinion , Her boyfriend seemed like a person who discourages her by ignoring her .
I am pretty sure having that kind of boyfriend for over seven years affected her personality little by little .
I do n't know when my dream comes true .
