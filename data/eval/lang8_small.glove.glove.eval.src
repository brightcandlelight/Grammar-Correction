So I went to ce ll p h on e sh op and I question ed why it re st ar ted by it s el f every time .
The as s is t ant said without feel ing that he did n ' t know the reason and it need ed to re p a ir at head office .
A l s o he me n tion ed that it might co st a charge .
Then I to t ally get ma d and I said , `` H u h !
What do you mean by you did n ' t know at all ? ?
You mean al th ough I bu y b ro k en thing , I have to put in money ?
I c a n ' t understand .
F or g e t it !
you are good for nothing ! ``
In the end , this pro ble m has n ' t so l v ed yet . . .
and I need to be a gentle man .
I have found good study English we b sit e
B e c a us e they take too much money .
I have heard some a ri t ic le that some English class es does n ' t good at tea ch English or some st ud ent does n ' t make any sen se or f it their English le ve l .
I might l u c k y girl because I can understand English even th o u h I do n ' t take any less on .
But my E ng l ish le ve l is middle .
I can con ver s ation with n at ive speak er .
I am glad I speak English and con ver s ation with n a it ive people .
I c a n ' t good at speak ing English but I can get along with n at ive people .
I am ha p p y that I could make a friend s with n at ive people
If you come to J a p an and speak a f e w J a p an e se , you will be prais ed for speak ing J a p an e se , even if the sen t ence you speak is very short .
That ' s because J a p an e se people think J a p an e se language is one of the most difficult language s in the world .
They have p ri d es in their own language .
However , in my opinion , J a p an e se is n ' t the difficult language comp ar ed to other language s .
There are two reason s .
J a p an e se have f e w er v ow el s and con s on ant s than English .
He want ed to say he was in the middle of the c amp a in and said loud ly , `` I have an e re ction now ! ``
The hard est one is to dis ting u ish `` hu r t `` from `` heart `` , `` f a st `` from `` first `` .
It sound s a b s o l ut e ly same to J a p an e se .
J a p an e se pro n un c i ation is e as i er than other as i an language s as well .
It has much more comp le x sound than the one of J a p an e se .
It does n ' t have ma le ver b s and f e m al e ver b s such as F re n ch , S p an ish and Russian .
No s ing ul ar for m s and p l ur al for m s .
No ar t ic le s need ed .
F e w er p at ter n s of con j u g ation .
The se are the two reason s for which I believe J a p an e se is not difficult .
I believe most difficult thing in le ar n ing J a p an e se is writing it because most people are n ' t us ed to it s letter s .
But you should n ' t he s it ate to start to le ar n J a p an e se .
I brought my do g tri m m ed yesterday .
The first p h ot o is the before , other s are the after .
I think every body has s im il i ar mind and similar po s i b il it ies .
He re is my question .
M a y b e there are some re s er a ch why people f a il when they try to le ar n language ?
Yes ter day , my school was a ha t day .
If we want ed to we ar our ha t , we had to pay $ 2 .
The money is con t ri b ut ed .
But I did n ' t we ar my ha t because I for g ot this day ^ ^
L is ten ing to English pro g r a m , study ing English ma g a z in e , e t c .
We have to st ud ed English now , or we w o n ' t pass an im p or t ant t est after three year s .
There is going to have a J an a ness school to v is te our school .
And I going to receiv e one of the st ud ent .
We have e i g h t J a p a ness students in each class .
We have a less on with them .
And we will tea ch T a i w a ness history about J a p an a g g re s s T a i w an .
We all laugh ed after our history teacher told us that .
M a y b e we will say something about con t ri b u tion after J a p a ness a g g re s s us .
We will have a l ot of act i v ies when J a p a ness students come .
I went to O k in a w a , which is so u ther n part of J a p an , as a school even t this week .
We were there for four days , and the first three days were ra in y and c l o ud y , so I did n ' t feel I was in so u ther n is l and .
A l s o , the hotel we stay ed at on the last day was at the c ent er of N a ha C ity , the c a p it al c ity of O k in a w a , so it made me feel like I was in Tokyo , too .
But It was the last big even t in my high s ch o o l life , so I enjoy ed sp en d ing time with my friend s there and visit ing many place s .
We did water act i v it ies in the beautiful o ce an , visit ed an a qu ar e um and a m us e um , and other things .
E ver y th ing went well without any trouble , and the tri p made me re al i z e an im p or t ant thing , so I think it was n ic e to have this ex pe ri ence .
I have been quite bu s y in last co up le of days be c ous e of my ex a m s at the U n ive r s ity .
I ' m a st ud ent at the S il es i an U n ive r s ity of T e ch no l o g y , at the f a c ul ty of E n v ir on ment al E ng in e er ing .
I enjoy my class es a l ot and I know I will mi s s them when I will gradua te .
I have one last ex a m left and when I pass e it , I ' m going to have some ho l i day s .
M e and my da d are going to visit F r ance to go s k i ing there .
I c a n ' t wait : ) When we will back I will have to start work ing at my the s is which is about v ent il ation and he at ing in pass ive house .
My ma in ta s k is to make a pro j e c t of it and make a co st - effect ive ness an a ly s is .
I re m e m b er the day when I first watch ed T er m in at or 2 .
It was a re ally ex c it ing f il m with two c y b or g guy s called ter m in at or cha s ing and fight ing each other .
But it made me wonder how soon we would see the so c i e ty where such c y b or g s or hu man o id ro b ot s are living with us .
A l th ough it still take s time before we can act u ally c re ate such so p h is t ic at ed c y b or g s , we may soon be able to have a simple r hu man o id ro b ot which can help us in our da i ly live s .
So if you want one of the ro b ot s to mo ve his right ar m , for ex amp le , all you need to do is just think about it in your head .
This is a w es ome .
I ' m a little conc er n ed that this kind of te ch no l o g y would be us ed for a mi l it ar y purpose ( as you can see in the mo v i e ) .
I know , for better or w or se , te ch no l o g ical de ve l op ment s have always come hand in hand with mi l it ar y act i v it ies .
B y the way , I think the mo v i e has it s se qu el .
A fter I came back home , I put on same - co l or up p er to ma t ch with it and I was sat is f i ed with the look s .
I los t my ha t on last sat ur day .
I got ma il about it was found .
It ' s re ally co o l to me e t a l ot of for e i g ne friend s here .
M an y l o ve ly people give s me co ur age and c or re ction , even though my E ng .
is a big dis aster , you guy s still c or re c t my mistake p at i ent ly .
I have been it ch y eyes all day .
My friend s said that you did n ' t s c r at ch eyes .
That ' ll make it w or se .
I thought about the cause .
I re g is ter ed to this sit e to day .
That mean s week en d is just around corner .
This week en d , my family will be he l d part y to ce le b r ate my da d ' s b ir th day .
I am not de c id ed yet but must set up for it at least this after no on .
I am think ing about sp or t s we ar to bu y for him to en c o ur age him to do work out .
She will stay 4 day s .
I c a n ' t wait for her .
A n y way I have a p l an to go to K y ot o r N ar a .
What do you think to go there ?
D o es she like it ?
I do n ' t know what kind of f o o d does she like .
You can p ar k your c ar just next to the hotel .
You can not p ar k your c ar here in front d u e to the no p ar k ing z on e are a .
As soon as I w ro te da ir ly , some c or re c ted commen t s re c i e v ed .
So I ' d like to con t in u e to write my da ir ly .
My do g `` F al `` who is I ta ri an gra y h ound , he does n ' t like
stay at home alone .
On ly a f e w hour s , he mi s se s me .
But do g s life is n ' t so long , I ' am going to stay with him
as possible I can .
I write di ar y in English for the first time ,
so my English is not good yet .
I ho pe you can c or re c t it .
To day was my b ir th day : )
I had my ha ir c ut and my black ha ir d y ed dark b r ow n .
It was great b ir th day !
But When I leave d my home , I would be l ate .
The bu s that I want ed to get on was was l ate to .
As a re s ul t I was able to get on the bu s , and I was just in time for job .
A bout K it t ies .
I ' m stay ing my friend s house now .
I think being c ut e is strong er than any thing now .
If now is the an c i ent age , they would be k il led or eat en im m ed i ate ly by s n a ke or something , but now is mo d er n er a .
S n a ke or something is p ic k ed out from their position by much strong er an im al , hu man being .
So , k it t ies got much more p ow er with their c ut i e .
K it ty ' s per f e c t c ut i e is much more p ow er ful than in c o m p le te p ow er of s n a ke or something now .
M an y people ga ther ed there to be a strong er ten n is play er .
A fter p r a c t ic ing , me and As an o ma t ch ed with strong pai r .
To tell the tru th , they were n ' t that strong , but we los t .
As an o was in the bad condition to day .
I re al i z ed when my pai r was in the bad condition , all you need is a tea m w or k .
I think many people are all have their new year ' s a im , so do I .
My new year ' s a im is that pass ed J a p an e se 2 le ve l and im p ro ve my e ng l ish .
S in ce I work ed , my study in ter e ting is less than before when I was in co ll e g e .
But I found if you don not study your bra in may be more and more not b ri g h t .
So I suppose that we must study if only have time .
I think you should n ' t be able to ch o o se when they want to di e .
S in ce it also m ur d er .
Some people said it not only help for the end of their s pai n but also it help to s l o ve their family ' s e c on o m ic pro ble m s .
They have a right which is their live a quiet life for the re st of their days .
This is a b less .
If they had a c ri m e , they could at on e .
I have n ' t been much of his t ri c bu f f myself .
So , I do n ' t know the de ta il s of an c i ent c i v il i z ation s .
I think they are still re le v ant to day because his t ry has a way of re pe at ing it s el f .
That way , they can feel f a m il i ar with the a c i ent history .
I think when you study history , it ' s good idea for us to try to see k what the history has in co m m on with our so c i e ty now .
G o d - by e , 2 0 0 9 !
I live in N Y since S ept e m b er , mo v ing from J a p an , and dis c o ver and wonder new things about U S , writing about my question s or commen t .
the other day I was sh ock ed with the dis p ut e on T V show .
she re p or ted her kid see m ing ly be ha ve s strange ly so that she asked what is wrong with her then she con f es s ed their father , I mean her hu s b and a b us e the d aught er .
the T V show was end up that she lie d because she want ed to get back the c ust o d y of her first d aught er who now live s with her ex hu s b and .
the reason that she was de p ri v ed of her c ust o d y of first ch il d was she was over d o es of co c a in ( I for g ot why she had it at that time )
I thought C o ur t T V show should de al with easy case , but I do n ' t know what is easy and what is serious in U S .
about the re st of my U K life
To day is the second day of M a y .
F o ur month es have pass ed since the new year ' s day and this mean s that my v is a ex p ir es with in ten month es .
R e c ent ly , I have been think ing how to sp en d the re st of my time in this country .
I left L on d on at the be g g in ing of M ar ch and I ' ve been work ing on the far m for two month es .
I can say that my life on the far m has been better than what I im a g in ed before begin n ing it .
But , honest ly , I am feel ing a little b it tired because of having been do ing physical works for two month es .
F or t un ate ly , I have some things to do in L on d on at the end of this month .
So it must be a good ch ance for me to take a re st and de c id e what I do after then .
I have n ' t de c id ed yet , but , after tak ing a re st , I would start work ing on the far m again and keep do ing it as long as possible .
This morning while I am sleep some one sen d the me s s age to me and said w a ke up w a ke No y something like that who is my s is ter that so for from my now but just about the dis t ance but we are close d about heart .
after that about 5 second she called me again to day good m on g ing I did not an w er s because we know if she called me it that mean would like to say something even morning or good night .
She leave d on s k y pe while me and ty l er talk ing because it is a bad con e ction from her country .
before she go ne she did not say some thing before as give me something as us a u ll ly she did it because she s un d ent ly to go ne .
I will as k her for H u g me another day .
and I want to say something with her I am sorry I have no money to sen t her back me s s age . poor no y .
also that day I have a listen a very good mi s ic from T y l er .
He c a n ' t s ing but he can hu m and dance and and play the quite r .
F ro m to day , I try to write a di ar y in English .
This n ic k n ame come from G H I B L I ' s character .
I like this G H I B L I ' s mo v i e like `` To n ar in o to t or o `` , `` M a z y on o T a k k y u b in ``
N e x t , I live in Ka n a g a w a J a p an .
But , I live d in F u ku o k a unti l this mar ch .
So now , I sea r ch good place like c a f e , p ar k , re st a ur ant and so on .
R e c ent ly , I had found good c a f e ! !
My re c o m m en d mo v i e is `` The ti g er and The s n ow `` .
I will do !
If I ' m a P i ture . . .
F or a long time , I went to So ng ga ng D on g f i el d in or d er to play b a se b a ll game at e ar ly mo r ing .
Then , I tired to go there and also It was di f f u c l t to dr ive my c ar because I me t a friend who live in S e o ul yesterday .
To day was very hot day .
We ma t ch ed in st it ut e of n ation al se c ur ity s c i ence at 1 1 p m .
I ' m a p i ture and 5 hi it er .
I ' m a bad b a se b a ll play er but I hard ex er c is ed d ur ing the la ter w in ter .
O ur game started at 1 2 : 0 0 and I was so n er ve ous .
My be se b a ll care er is short er than any on e but I have good physical a b il it ies that f a st f o ot s , strong sh o l d er s , end ur ance for any pai n .
I also ent h us i a st ic ally do everything not to los e . .
The C a ll i g r a p h y of C h in e se and the tra d it on al C h in e se pai n ting !
H i , for e i g n friend s , es pe c i ally who like C h in e se c ul ture , I want to show you two im p or t ant part s of C h in e se c ul ture to day !
The C a ll i g r a p h y of C h in e se , which has 3 0 0 0 year s at least , is a b ri ll i ant tra d i tion al ar t .
I have le ar n ed it by myself , the picture in my al b um is w ro te by myself ( * _ * ) .
The C h in e se pai n ting , the another tra d i tion al ar t , is dr e w by writing b r us h which is also us ed to C a ll i g r a p h y !
the picture in my al b um is also dr e w by myself .
The C a ll i g r a p h y of C h in e se and the tra d it on al C h in e se pai n ting both
So this ar t ic le must be wrong in many place , than k s for your c or re c ting and a d v ic e ! )
I come back to home .
I take a M on or a il .
My house is con ve n i ence .
B e c ous e near st ation .
I have no re l i g ion , but the class is he l d for any on e who is interest ed in .
A l th ough I ' m not that school st ud ent , they we l c ome me , so this is re ally good op p or t un ity to le ar n English and B i ble .
S in ce our re g ul ar teacher have to work for another te m p or ar y job for 6 week s , my A m er ic an friend who us ed to a st ud ent of the class sub st it ut es for our teacher for the time being .
I have become to feel close r to her than before .
This year I ' ve started to study b al le t , it ' s know n that you only can le ar n to dance b al le t when you are a ch il d , or at least that was I always t ough t , but I was l u c k y to have the ch ance .
I w o n ' t lie , I was re ally as ha m ed because I was the old est of the girl s there , but with time pass ing I le ar n t to enjoy it ^ ^
O ur p rofessor always say s : `` I will never per m it my students to be less than me , you have to be e qu al or better than me ``
This month he want s our de b ut as a b al le t comp an y , not only as a a c ad e m y , so we are do ing a show with another a c ad e m ies of P er u , C h i le and A r g ent in a .
We are do ing `` C op pe l i a `` , even if we are not pro f f es ion al s dance r s just a d d ing a little of f un to the original play is do ing it great .
I s It G o o d to be P er s u as ive
In my c ul ture , people are not always a g g r as s ive , and we are always think ing about other s more or as much as our s el ve s .
S in ce I were not from the States , I am not sure about the c ul ture here .
As far as I have heard and ex pe ri e c ed , the c ul ture here is that people care about themselves more than other s and they are more s el f - c ent er ed , which I do n ' t mean in a good way or bad way .
S in ce the c ul ture is very im p or t ant in the every day life .
what we should act depend on the c ul ture or no r m in the place we live .
F or ex amp le , in my country , the dis t ance between people is small , so everything can be f le x i ble and depend s on the re l ation s h i p between people in v o led .
However , in the United States , re g ul ation s and law s are first .
There f or e , I always think before I act be c u a se I am not sure what is the right way to do .
F or ex amp le , I have a question : if some on e re f us ed your propos al , is it o k to be per s u as ive and as k the person again ?
To day , I went to watch mo v i e .
A ti t le is `` eat play l o ve `` J ul i a R o b er t s is play ing in this show .
My friend said the sat is f a ction of this mo v i e is not so good by a s ur ve y on the we b s ite , but I do n ' t think so .
It was good mo v i e .
She who is the ma in character in this show tra ve led L ta ly , In d i a and B al i .
She me t many pe p le and found her s el f .
She took ma d it ation in In d i a .
It see m s so hard but I think it Y s a good way to see myself de e p ly .
If I have some pro ble m , I want to try do ing it .
M or e o ver , When I saw the scene in I ta ly , it made me want to go to I ta ly .
A c t u ally , I have been there and at e past a and p i z z a .
The p i z z a that I at e in I ta ly is the be st in my life .
I want to eat that one again .
It has been 3 m on th s since I came here .
I was suppose d to give le c ture s right after mo v ing into this c ity , but for t un ate ly ( ? ) at that time it was a va c ation .
A t the first time I enjoy ed my free time .
I re al i z ed that do ing nothing make s my body and so ul tired the most .
The most difficult thing in some on e ' s life might is to find ex a c t C l o th es , I think .
Where my c l o th es is wait ing for me ?
I s there any c l o th es that f it me . . ?
( But , , . .
A c t u ally I b ough t 3 shirt s and 1 p ant s . .
That ' s it . . )
If I find a pretty good c l o th es , put it down first .
is this thing I re ally want ?
N e x t , If the c l o th es is re ally good on me , P le a se think again , I s this what I re ally ne ce s s ar y ? ?
I b ough t one p ant s a f e w month s a g o .
When ever I put on that p ant s , It look s like hi p ho p style .
It do n ' t f it my body , It make s me look like d w ar f .
It was im p ul se bu y ing . .
So , I de c id e when I bu y any c l o th es , I ' ll follow that s te p ! !
If your friend say you to bu y something , Say `` Let me sleep on it `` .
S t ud i o G h i b l i was est a b l ish ed for M i y a z a k i in 1 9 8 5 .
S t ud i o G h i b l i has to con t in u e living as a comp an y , so , it has to c ul t i v ate new t al ent s of an im ation f il m s .

I like to live here but a little in c on ve n i ent .
B e c a us e I have to go to se o ul every day It ' s too far from I l s an .
It ' s very bu s y life .
I a little mi s s my old house .
H i guy s , it ' s a long time since I w ro te a di ar y last time .
I like d draw picture when I was e le ment ar y school er , and now , I like us ing P h ot o s h op .
It took 3 0 mi n from my f l at s by b i ke , so I do n ' t go there over time . .
H a ha , now I ' m bra g ing about it .
But still I c a n ' t draw p ic us ing P h ot o s h op and still do n ' t have any con f id ent about it .
A c t u ally I us ed so f t w ar e on the we b to pro ce s s the picture .
the big bo y ( ? ) on this p ic is original ly picture .
This is so r t of f est i v al po s ter .
One of my friend man age this f est i v al through his c l u b .
He dr a g g ed in va ri ous kind of people .
In addition , he asked to comp an y to be sp on s or , and got some money .
My go al is to make good po s ter s and works without some so f t w ar e but P h ot o s h op .
what ' s your ho b b y ?
S or ry I do n ' t us e di ction ar y a l ot this time , so there is probab ly a l ot of mistake s . . . > <
It was so la z y day . . .
I have n ' t been to s w im m ing po o l and my s w im m ing s k i ll s are in a bad condition : ( I must do s th with it .
To day is very w ar m and fine day .
But this fine days w o n ' t last much long er .
I ' m watch ing T V pro g r a m `` P U - S S U M A `` now , it ' s very p op ul ar pro g r a m .
In J A P A N , we have many c as u al ( family ) re st a ur ant s of va ri ous co un t ri es f o o d .
It ' s very funny pro j e c t .
L a st S un day , I b ough t a co f f e e make r Y O D O B A S H I came r a in A k i b a .
I ' m from V i e t n a m I want to le ar n K or e an and English with you guy s !
No t to eat good f o o d made me feel bad while I was work ing .
I re ally re al i z ed that proper me al was im p or t ant for my he al th .
I watch ed H ar ry P ot ter and the half b l o o d p r in ce .
D is a p po in t !
I come this sit e every day , to find who have ent ri ed my sit e and sen t me me s s age .
I said to myself if you do n ' t write no body will come your H ome to help you c or re c t your mistake s .
F ri en d s , no m at ter what c c o un t ri es you come from and what language s you want to le ar n , I think we can make friend s , not only for the reason `` le ar n language `` .
It mean s litera l ly `` go out of the ho s p it al `` ?
or it mean s `` go out with th i er bo y f ri en d s or girl f ri en d s `` ?
The se two sen t ence s mean ex a c t ly the same thing ?
The f a m a ous ra p p er that know n by J a p an e se people .
M a y b e it is only you ng people know about E m in e m .
M a y b e the other a ir t is t are n ' t know n by J a p an e se people .
M a y b e the J a p an e se people like s ra p or R & B who would know the other ra p p er .
Why is E m in e m know n by the J a p an es people is he was act ing the mo v ies , 8 m i le .
F ro m then I like him .
B e f or e he was act ing the mo v i e I was like his so ng s .
He had so l d f un ra p m us ic those day .
There was such a ra p m us ic but there was n ' t being such a E m in im .
S in ce I started work ing at the U n ive r s ity , I re m e m b er of ten my high school days .
I had some good friend s and laugh ed a l ot every day .
We talk ed about some on e we were interest ed in , teachers , b a se b a ll game s , m us ic , mo t or c y c le , part - time job and our dr e a m s . . !
That was a pretty good days for us .
But we might have st ud i ed more . .
When we gradua te from the high school , my friend s ga ve me a great p ri z e .
That was `` the f un n est p ri z e in a class `` !
But my friend got the p re t t ies t girl p ri z e , another friend got the s m ar t est p ri z e . . . .
it ' s O k a y .
any way , I was the to p in a class . . . !
A c t u ally , still I like ma k ing people laugh .
One of my friend s is a p h y s ic i an , one live s in F r ance , one is a stay - at - home mother right now .
We have n ' t me e t each other for a long time , so some time s I ' d like to me e t them .
to day I have only r us s i an and l at in language s at the un ive r s ity .
tomorrow we ' ll have a t est on our English less on .
also we need to make a pro j e c t about f a m ous people or f a m ous law y er s of our c ity .
I c a n ' t even know what to write !
A l s o we should le ar n by heart about 2 0 0 new w or d s in English .
and more o ver our l i b r ar y does n ' t want to give us our b ook s .
B ur I ho pe it will get w ar m er .
I like r ock m us ic but I some time s listen j a z z , electronic and p op ( ? ) m us ic .
I want to listen English so ng s for p r a c t ic e of English .
No w all students in R us s i a have ex a m s now .
It ' s hard time . . .
No w I write a course about fashion of 7 0 ' s .
I like 7 0 ' s hi p p i e , p un k , dis c o , st ud i o 5 4 .
I saw a f il m `` st ud i o 5 4 `` , it was a c r a z y c l u b .
There is a c l u b `` st ud i o 74 `` in the c ity where I live , but it is n ' t like in N e w Y or k ha ha
I do n ' t know what to write , I think my letter become s b or ing
It ' s been a big pro ble m to me for a long time .
to day when I was study ing English , I re al i z ed that I was n ' t el i g i ble to become a teacher because I did n ' t know of good con ver s ation s .
I think I ' m not qu al if i ed to become a teacher unless I enjoy con ver s ation s .
If you do n ' t have co m m un ic ation s k i ll , you should n ' t tea ch .
As I re al i z ed a b o ve conc l us ion this after no on , I went to a ch ur ch where I hung out a l ot .
There I de c id ed to talk what I have in mind more po s it ive ly .
N e x t time , I ' m going to talk to a person who has been at t r a c t ive for me . .
In t ro d e u ce myself
He ll ow ! !
I gradua ted from a co ll e g e , and started to work for a comp an y from this sp r ing .
I dr e a m to study a b ro ad but I have just only poor poor English s k i ll ! !
No w , I study e c on o m ic s more than it s in se my job is de e p ly re la ted with e c on o m ic s .
My favor it f o ot b a ll tea m
I had written some writing on my b l o g 9 days in a r ow .
I start ma k ing a new re c or d from to day on ! !
That is J a p an e se pro f es s ion al f o ot b a ll tea m .
I ' m a v id f an of them .
That make s me de light ed tru ly .
In fact , J e f is not strong tea m , and they are in second di v is ion of J a p an e se f o ot b a ll le a gue .
O ri g in ally , They were first di v is ion .
L a st year , they could n ' t be pro m ot ed to first di v is ion .
This year , the le a gue is just started .
A c t u ally the ma t ch w o n ' t be a ir ed by any T V pro g r a m .
so A ll I can do is to c he c k the pro g re s s on in ter ne t .
To day , I was sleep y in all class es .
I was ex cited so much yesterday , so It must have made me tired .
B e ing good condition is very im p or t ant when we take a t est de f in ite ly .
C o un t ry s that I want to visit are T ha il and , U .
That is too much but , I ' d like to visit that country s T .
I want to ex pe ri ence c ul ture or f est i v al of other country s ( H a ll ow e en , S a m b a , O p er a , e t c . . . )
But , There are K or e an f est i v al that I not ex pe ri ence .
There f or e , I want to ex pe ri ence our c ul ture s before .
I ' d like to ex pe ri ence M ud F est i v al that one of our f est i v al s .
M ud F est i v al is play ing f est i v al , a p p ly ing all body to m ud .
I ' m d y ing to go that .
To day , I write my di ar y in my free time .
I am see ing e ng l ish mo v i e .
I want to get us ed to n at ive speak .
I am f a c k ed with a many difficult pro ble m .
I c ar ry on study and life s ty le .
I know that many people think that in S i b er i a there is w in ter all year round .
But S i b er i a is very very big .
On the most are a s um m er is every year .
On ce I heard that in S i b er i a be ar s walk on town s ' street s .
And in the N e w Y e ar people catch all be ar s in their town , ha r ness them and ri d e on s led g es all night .
There are be ar s of c o ur se .
They live in de e p for est s , not in c it ies .
I live in S i b er i a all my life and me e t be ar s only in the z o o .
To day , the morning is co o l , and the after no on is w ar m .
F or this reason , we have to be care ful of catch ing a co l d .
To day , because there were not l ot s of people , I sp ent my sp ar e time .
I have st ud i ed in English like di c t ation , as well as read ing .
What is more , next week I w ll go to a language school to im p ro ve my speech .
This C M was for the di g it al i z ation of T V .
This C M said that just two month s leave ti ll the start ing of the di g it al i z ation .
I felt it ' s just around the corner .
A n y way , how about your country ?
the T V di g it al i z ation is co m m on ?
E ng l s i h speak er s us e high f re qu en c y .
When English speak er s speak English , they are us ing very high to ne s comp ar ed to J a p an e se people .
Some time s I am watch ing and listen ing English ar t is t s ' mo v i e on You T u b e , but even ma le ar t is t s ' to ne s are very high .
E s pe c i ally some f e m al e English speak er s are speak ing English with very high to ne s .
It look s like very pretty for J a p an e se me n .
As if their voice s are J a p an e se voice act or s who are act ing ch il d .
I like L in k ing P ar k .
I want to speak English f l u ent ly as my mother to n gue . . .

With o ut con st r a in t , please speak to me .
In the future , I have to speak English f l u ent ly for my o c c up ation .

T h re e days a g o , I and my un ive r s ity friend s at e k im u ch i p an in my un ive r s ity friend s .
We put a va ri ous kind of f o o d .
F or ex amp le , C h in e se c a b b age s , ha c k b er ry s , to f us , J a p an e se n i k ud an g o s , g y o u z as and so on .
We put c he e se on .
It was de l ic ion s more .
I have ever eat en it .
This was very very good !
K y ot o is J a p an e se tra d i tion al c ity .
In J a p an , it is a ut um .
So leave s turn ed re d .
We walk ed as look ing at co l or ed leave s .
I could n ' t see k i y o m i z ud er a at night because of not having time .
If you have a ch ance to go to K y o ut o , I re c o m m en d to go to `` k i y o m i z ud er a `` .
I was ha p p y to have live a full life in this week .
Yes ter day , I were play ing with my friend s .
While eat ing de s s er t , we p on d er what we should do after w ar d s .
f il m ti t le is ' ro b in h o o d ' .
The mo v i e is very ex c it ing and good .
We pro m is ed to me e t after f in al ex a m .
What a interest ing b ook ! !
The a se days I am read ing the no ve l `` M aster of the game `` written by S id ne y She l d on .
My friend re c ome n d ed me that it ' s so interest ing that I c a n ' t stop read ing .
A c t u ally , once I started to read , I could n ' t stop even if the even ing went on !
so , I never start to read ing from night .
I am read ing it in J a p an e se now , but after finish read ing , I would like to try
to read in English .
In the no ve l , `` The so n of Ka te ( who was one of the read ing ro le ) , To n n y `` was
ho s p it al i z ed for p s y ch i at ri c reason s .
B e c ous e his w if e M ar i an ne was de ad .
It ' s tra g ed y .
I ' m wonder ing how the end , and look ing for w ar d to read .
I have called to a comp an y , G T N to day for some reason .
G T N see m s to help for e i g n people who would want to mo ve to J a p an to find a a p ar t ment .
T w o month s have just go ne and I have not made any im p ro ve ment of my or al e ng l ish . . .
U p to now , I still have n ' t got any success ful ex pe ri ence of talk ing to a for e i g n er , re ally sh ame on myself . . .
My school has been started on this M on day , so I had a little b it bu s y days in this week .
I re ally feel I already need more b re a k , I know the w in ter b re a k have just finish ed though ~ ha ha .
My friend and me had nothing to do because we were c r a z y about sh op p ing .
But we went to P en n state un ive r s ity which was a very hu g e un ive r s ity .
I me t some school se c ur ity guy s and they asked us , `` A re you guy s coming here to a p p ly the co ll e g e ? `` , but we were just to ur is t s so we said that we did n ' t have nothing to do , so we came here ~ ha ha . ``
I person ally think no body want s to visit or a p p ly the co ll e g e on C h ri st m as day ~ C h ri st m as is a sp e c i al ho l i day for many people , right ?
I want to go to p en n sat e again because we visit ed some his t or ical m us e um but they were close d so We just took some picture s in front of them .
To day , my room m ate a w a k en me up e ar ly in the mo r n i g though because she thought I was over s le e p .
A l re ad y , I have been living in H an o i for 5 month .
When I ar ri v ed at V i e t n a m 5 month a g o , it was s um m er .
But now , It has already became w in ter in V i e t n a m .
there were many things in here .
B la c k o ut , F l o o d , a S t ro ng s un s h in e and a very ver y hot day .
The time is get ting f aster .
V i e t n a m has also w in ter .
Some time s I was draw ing about my dr e a m ' s beautiful life on the w h ite s n ow while I was look ing at s n ow .
but I never see s n ow any where in V i e t n a m .
S n ow is never f al ling down .
I study English by la ng - 8 from now on !
B e c a us e I want to le ar n that writing and speak ing s k i ll in English .
However I have s n ow in my un ive r s ity town to day .
R e c ent ly , we have strange we a ther s more and more .
When people are going to ce le b r ate a sp e c i al even t such as gradua tion or a sp e c i al part y , some of them prefer a large part y , while some of them prefer a small part y a f e w close friend s and family me m b er s . W h i ch do you prefer ?
When it come s to whether we should as k people as more as possible to at ten d our ce le b r ation s with c ent r al im p or t ance , this is s u e is always very thought - pro v o k ing and w or th y of serious de l i b er ation s .
Some people l o ve to invite many friend s and re l at ive s to sha re their ha p p i ness , but other s hold a world s - a p ar t opinion , be l i e v ing that the be st me m or y should only be sh ar ed with their close friend s and family me m b er s .
P er s on ally speak ing , I prefer to ce le b r ate my im p or t ant d ate with a l ot of people .
F ir st of all , I can make friend s with the people who will probab ly help me in the future .
As a pro ver b go es , the more so c i al con ne ction s you have , the more like ly you could have a s m o o th life .
I me t my J a p an e se teacher , R i ch ar d , on my gradua tion part y .
S up po s ing my be st friend , J a c k , had not invite d him to our part y , I could not have the ch ance to le ar n J a p an e se from R i ch ar d .
With the help of R i ch ar d , I work for a great re n ow n ed J a p an e se comp an y , M o T o S i B a , and get a de c ent salary .
There f or e , it is R i ch ar d that open s this w in d ow for me .
S e c on d , a part y is more than just f o o d and w in e since it is a good place to p r a c t ic e so c i al s k i ll s .
Some people may c ry out that they do not feel to t ally re la x if they stay in a sit u ation with f e w a c qu a in t ance s .
However , so c i al s k i ll s are re ally es s ent i al when they ent er into a comp an y .
If I had one more ch ance to p r a c t ic e my so c i al s k i ll s , I would do my ut m o st to talk to the people who I did not f a m il i ar with in any circumstance s .
This point is quite o b v i ous to be understood when you comp ar ed the N e w Y e ar ' s E ve and your pe t ' s b ir th day .
E ver y body will agree that th ous and s of people c r ow d on the street at that time to ce le b r ate this wonder ful even t is far ha p p i er than ce le b r at ing their pe t ' s b ir th day at home .
The reason is - - It is the number matter s .
On the one hand , number s c re ate a good at m o s p he re , and on the other hand , no soon er s c re a m the first person than every on e in the same place get ex cited .
T h us , the she er number of people c re ate j o y ful at m o s p he re .
To conc l ud e , I l o ve to as k people come to my part y as more as possible .
No t only can I me e t the people who might help me in the future , but also , I am able to im p ro ve my so c i al s k i ll s through this part y .
Besides , the more people in my part y , the better at m o s p he re it will be .
when I go to the for e i g n co un t ri es that I am s c ar e two things , such as
I went to j a p an for st ad y , but I never st ad y J a p an e se before .
it is difficult to live there at the moment .
be cause I c a n ' t speak J a p ne se s and hard to make friend s in J a p an that let me feel so l on e ly , and want to give up st ad y in J a p an .
Even though you might thought that we do n ' t p r a c t ic e e ar n est ly , in fact , we do .
R es ul t of to day ` s work
A fter long time , I did c ar p ent ar work to day .
My physical was de c l in ing . . .
It ` s so f r a st r at ing , but It ` s re al ity .
In the future , as far as possible , I con t in u ed to do c ar p ent ry !
When I went to sea t t le , I us ed bu s a f e w time s .
And I re al i z ed there was no an no un ce or in d ic ation that show s the next bu s stop ' s name .
In J a p an , there always be di g it al s c re en and an no un ce , which make s me re la x ti ll the de st in ation even if it is the first time us ing that bu s .
How do you think about it ?
P le a se tell me .
I watch ed interest ing new s pro g r a m in this morning .
J a c k ( K i e f er S u ther l and ) came to J a p an .
A t that time , a J a p an e se help ed him .
The man did n ' t know him who is a act or .
I think the man can speak English .
I ho pe that I can speak English , too .
I have never spoke n English .
only a ma il and a cha t sit e .
D o you know the k it ty - cha n ?
I of ten he ar f a m ous people like L ad y G a g a l o ve it .
As for me , I did n ' t ha te it , but I did n ' t es pe c i ally like it .
I of ten ha ng out with one of my co - work er s , K .
One day , she said , `` I ' ll in t ro d u ce my friend to you because you look like you ' ll get along with my friend . ``
: M id d le - a g ed guy who se ho b b y is to co ll e c t k it ty - cha n pro d u c t s .
I was surprise d at first , but I gradua l ly got us ed to him , and I like the way K can make friend s with any body .
The guy who l o ve s k it ty - cha n look s re ally ha p p y when he got his new co ll e c ting it e m .
So , every time I see k it ty - cha n , I care about it like `` D o es he have this it e m ? `` , and the more I look at it , the more I feel it ' s c ut e .
My go al s in a long run
My some w or d s did n ' t con ve y the mean ing what I want to say .
L an g u age is a too l to co m m un ic ate with people , so bad pro n un c i ation mean s a bad co m m un ic ation .
When I go back to J a p an , I want to make my English better like n at ive speak er s .
There are so many w or d s to pro no un ce for J a p an e se such as re ally , re l at ive ly , v o c a b ul ar y and so on .
There are some similar sound , but this sound is like between R and L .
So J a p an e se people ' s to n gue do n ' t get us ed to pro no un ce them .
To a ch i e ve my go al s , there see m like so many difficult ies on the ro ut e .
On the 1 5 th of this month , I s an g two so ng s on the st age of my comp an y ' s year - end part y with my co ll e a gue s .
A l th ough there was a a c ous t ic trouble in the first minute , the st age was success ful large ly .
E ver y on e seemed to enjoy our st age and the C E O a d m ir ed my s ing ing : )
F ir st T h an k s g i v ing in my life
To day is the first than k s g i v ing day in my life .
But , I was surprise d that this ho l i day is so im p or t ant for am er ic an .
This is like H a p p y new year ' s day in J a p an .
A n y way , I will have a p ot l u c k in this even ing , and will go D .
for sight se e ing from tomorrow morning ! !
a or the ? always an no y ing pro ble m . . .

A fter all , I at e all of c ur ry , but I have st o m a ch a ch e now .

T h ough my mother la ng u ar g e is C h in e se ,

also have no idea what I can write .
However , I ' ll try to keep do ing this as I want to im p ro ve my English .
And ho pe there ' s always some on e will c or re c t my E ng .
To day is middle day of a year
In V i e t n a m we call ' T e t D o an N g o ' .
They just had a qu ar re l while a g o .
I felt very an no y ing .
That was the thing ! !
I tri ed to stop her s c o l d ing on my da d .
`` Why not take a new to w el for your s el f `` Some th ing see m s very easy to me but hard for my m um .
Why m um can not as gentle as me ? ~ ~ ~ ha ha
I sen d an e m a il and receiv ed the re p ly .

And I receiv ed the re p ly for it yesterday .
It said we can visit the Tokyo O f f ic e and talk about the visit some in st it ut es in S ing a po re .
It is get ting clear to visit S ing a po re .
I feel ha p p y for it .
We have a re la y ra ce in our fact or y c ite after work tomorrow .
It is the 6 1 th an n u al one .
M an y people see m to have been look ing for w ar d to the ra ce as every year .
A n y way , I think that I l o ve run n ing and other s also do .
F in ally , I have ar ri v ed in A ust r al i a last F ri day .
No w I feel like more than 1 month has pass ed since I came here .
That may be because my life s ty le has change d a l ot so quick ly I c a n ' t believe I was work ing at the b an k unti l quite re c ent ly .
I do n ' t mi s s J a p an e se f o o d yet since my ho st m um is a very good c ook .
I may mi s s S um m er in J a p an .
It ' s quite co l d here , co l d er than I expect ed .
E n j o y dr in k ing in a Y u k at a with go r g e ous f i re w or k s for me , my friend s .
When I was in J a p an , I had no difficult y as k ing things to people and I like d talk ing to people on a street but now , it can be difficult .
No t to able to explain what I want to say an no y s me at time s but I will keep try ing not to us e J a p an e se , al th ough there are many J a p an e se here and some of them are us ing J a p an e se almost all the time .
I ho pe I will be able to speak anything what I want to say in the near future .
I have f e w friend s around listen ing to the same m us ic .
The next train always come s in a f e w mi n .
And they are very ex p en s ive .
E a ch train con ne c t s a different sub way st ation .
I some time s ch o o se the se line s because I do not need to walk to get the st ation from my house .
Yes , it is very easy to go to the office .
Well , when I take easy line s , I have to a d j ust my bu d g e t at l un ch time . . . .
a one week will be start f e w hour s la ter but I will do the my be st too .
I qu ar re l w ed with my friend yesterday .
I ho pe ha p p y every day , so I told me I should find some ha p p y thing in or d er to change my feel ing .
To day , I help my part n er get a good idea .
And a new part n er who get P H D de g re e from A m er ic a will j o in us .
That is thing what I feel ha p p y to day ! How about you ? D o you have some good new s to me ?
U s u ally , I make a call once a week , but the se co up le of week s I did n ' t .
On the p h on e , she said , `` Well , there ' s nothing sp e c i al , but I ' m wonder ing how are you do ing . `` I said , `` I ' m O K , mo m .
S or ry for not ma k ing a p h on e call and how have you been ?
`` O ur con ver s ation con t in u e this way .
She is 8 0 now , and she re pe at s the same thing again , I mean , same one as which I had heard last time .
I listen to her no d d ing , `` h m . . , that ' s good . . . . o h . . . `` and my last w or d s are al way s the same , `` T a ke good care of your s el f , M o m . ``
This p h on e call re m in d ed me of my b l o g family me m b er ' s ent ry j o ur n al `` R e al M o ther s `` .
`` R e al M o ther s know that a ch il d ' s gr ow th is not me as ur ed by he i g h t or your gra d e . . .
She ' s way out of d ate !
4 5 year s of age - - W on d er what M o m would have thought about it .
6 5 year s of age - - W ish I c l o ud talk it over with M o m .
I ' m l u c k y and ha p p y because she is going well and I ' m in the sit u ation which I can a f f or d to listen to her .
M o ther ' s day is coming soon , and my mother always say s , `` I do n ' t want anything , and I ' m glad that you care about me , and it ' s enough . `` when I asked her what I can do for her .
This year I could some h ow got to know what she want ed now , so I ' m going sh op p ing for her , `` a n ic e b l ous e `` .
T h an k you for c or re c ted to my da i ly .
I ' m very ha p p y , but I think to study English .
I ' m very co l d to my house .
I ' m eat ing b re a k f a st for hot noodle .
V ir g in i a , how are you being on this C h ri st m as ?
I was 1 2 year s old when I first heard of your C h ri st m as story written as an ed it or i al of N e w Y or k S un .
I was a know - it - all bo y and I got f r ow n at that time .
I do n ' t re m e m b er what ex a c t ly I thought , but I just did n ' t like a beautiful story that every on e would l o ve , and did n ' t think anything what it mean s .
V er y sorry about that , but one little ch il d has many things other than think ing around a story from a for e i g n country .
No w I am enough old .
F or a gr ow n - up , I have much time to do that kind of thing .
I said I got f r ow n when I read this story , probab ly because I did not believe in S ant a at that time even though I knew it would be co m f or t able for me to believe in S ant a .
L o g ic has very strong p ow er that per s u ad es any hu man being s , but after all they c a n ' t live only with it .

Some time s I will consider what is the be st way to le ar n a language ex c ept study a b ro ad since I do n ' t have much money .

Some of them le ar n English for pro m o tion ; Some of them le ar n it for co m m un ic at ing with c ust ome r at work .
But my mo t ive at first is just for f un .
No w I wonder this reason is too we a k to le ar n e f f ic i en y le , because there is f e w ch ance to work by English at my job .
When I was in my un ive r s ity , I be l on g ed to the c y c ling c l u b and tra ve led about J a p an by b ic y c le .
It is because a large part of H o k k a id o has so wide ro ad s that c y c l is t s like me run very s m o o th ly .
In addition , people in H o k k a id o are g en er ous to c y c l is t s because an um b er of c y c l is t s visit there every year .

A l th ough we all start le ar n ing English at middle school in J a p an , there are not so many J a p an e se people who are f l u ent in it .
And we even have a re p ut ation for not speak ing English .

There are many f a c il it ies for tra n s p or t ation like B T S in B an g k o k .
To day at 4 o ' clock a . m . , I and my father w o ke up because we heard the ga te s qu a k ing .

I ' ve read some po e m s ever , but I had n ' t been interest ed in po e t ry so much all my life .
So If you have your favor ite po e t s and their works , I ' d like you to tell me about them .
P le a se ^ ^
They did b as ke t b a ll game .
I have no con f id ence at my appear ance .
I ' m afraid of other eyes every day .
When I found a n ic e c l o th es at the ma ll , I could n ' t ch o o se be st one .
I ' m at los e it good on me or not .
As a re s ul t , I ch o o se b as ic and simple style .
I wish I could show myself with a n ic e dress kind of fashion able read er !
I like to study every thing around me so so much .
But in the other hand I ha te to have ex a m s ,

So he ll o strange r .
H o pe we will get along well and than k s for your c or re c ting my gra m m ar here , too .
I found that it is difficult to write my da i ly life ,
so I tra n s l ate my favor ite no ve l s !
I think it is very hard to tra n s l ate all of the no ve l ,
I am going to di v id e no ve l into some part s .
The woman who are 2 1 year s old c ri ed with gr i e f and walk ed
so it was natural that some people looked me s us p ic i ous ly .
But I , still , could not stop c ry ing .
He was she p h er d and had gra y eyes
When he came to my home , he was still b a b y .
When he run the c or ri d or , he s l i p p ed with his be l ly on the c or ri d or .
I felt it was very c ut e , so I called his name and made him run again
and again . ( E ver y body laugh ed because it was like a mo p . )
He l o v ed e g g f o o d , ic e c re a m and pe ar s .
he some time s s qu in ted when w in d ble w .
And he , D u ke k is s ed me very well .
A c t u ally almost of our J a p an e se is not good at speak ing in English ,
S O , In J a p an ' s b ook st or es , you can look for the English te x t easily .
F or J a p an e se , it ' s co o l to speak L an g u age without J a p an e se !
In addition , S pe a k ing in English mean s we can have many friend s in the world and will have as t w ic e friend s as we have now .
I am writing to express my po s it ive impress ion s on the s er v ic es provide d by the R e ad al ot B ook C l u b and to give some suggest ion s for it s im p ro ve ment .

I was also very please d with the c ust ome r re v i e w f e a ture , which I found to be very us e ful indeed .
S t at ing such a draw b a c k would a d d to the in te g r ity of the c l u b .
In addition , I would like to see a quick er de l ive ry s y s te m being im p le ment ed , since the per i o d of wait ing is some time s as long as a who le week .
O ur first class us ed to at e i g h t but at ten on T us e day .
To day is T u es day , I for g ot it , so I get up e ar ly .
A fter my b re a k f a st , I came back and sat on the be d , sleep i ness came to me .
h ence , I had to get into the be d c l o th es again .
The im age s show ed a w il d po l ar be ar that is going near to te ther ed s led do g s in the w il d s of `` H ud s on B `` in C an ad a !
But , It ' s hard to believe that this po l ar be ar only need ed to hu g some on e ! _ _ _ _ !
How to get to my c ar p ar k k ing sp a ce from my a p ar t ment .
U p the s ta ir and just walk straight , so you ' ll find my re d c ar .
Yes ter day , the re s c u e started , and I watch ed the new s unti l the first person has be e s a v ed .
I could n ' t watch such that moment on T V re al time , but I can now .
H is t or ical even t happen ed in the past , I thought those should be de s c ri b ed us ing past ten se .
The new s pro g r a m made in the U S A , so I ' m sure that present ten se must be us ed to de s c ri b e his t or ical even t s .
I just found out the light !
I just found out L an g - 8 .
How could I did n ' t know `` L an g - 8 `` ? !
I think I need some time to look around this sit e .
No w , I ' m so ha p p y and ex cited .
It feel s like my English is get ting better .
P le a se be ha p p y day !
P s y ch o l o g is t S ter n b er g , propos e that l o ve can be de v id ed into three e le ment s .
T h o se are In t im a c y , P as s ion and C o m m it ment .
In ter es ing thing or could be un f or t un ate , is man and woman va l u e those things different ly .
U s u ally man think P as s ion is the ke y of l o ve , but woman consider In t im a c y or C o m m it ment is the ke y .
It ' s because woman sub conc i ous ly care about her ( not their ) C h il d .
And I found very ex c it ing s ta st ical da ta to day .
`` 2 0 % of ch il d is not father ' s re al ch il d ``
I could n ' t find the so ur ce so it c a n ' t be dis t or tion fact .
you should con f id ent i ally consider D N A t est before you mar ry .
But I do like the s m e ll of S n ow ing day .
I was ha p p y a little .
There is an o il he at er in the a ch er ' s room .
So one of teacher brought sweet po te t o s and b ur n t it .
I change my opinion .
I like the s m e ll and such a co l d day .
C on d i tion al sen t ence s are one of un it s
which I have not understand well yet .
B : If I had no other s ch ed ul es , I could go with you .
A : Yes ter day we enjoy ed dr in k ing at be er ga r d en .
B : If I had had no other s ch ed ul e , I could have go ne with you .
A t time s the c at s will c l im b up the con d o s and then ga ther on the ro o f t op .
I like to a p p re c i ate them la z i ly sp r a w ling on the ro o f , enjoy ing the b re e z e at s um m er night and the s un s h in e in w in ter from my b al c on y .
S e e ing their face full ing with sat is f a ction make s me feel so r t of glad e all day .
It ' s a interest ing sight .
Yes ter day , first time to at ten d a English c ir c le .
We had talk ed about in t ro d u ce our s el f .
But we could n ' t talk so m us h .
B e c a us e O ur English s k i ll are ent ry le ve l .
So How should we start to le ar n ing English in my c ir c le .
The ty p h o on had come and the w in d is blow ing strong .
We l ock ed all the do or s but still could the strong w in d blow ing .
T y p h o on always mean s a good thing to me .
I was going to see her to ce le b r ate her b ir th day but my p ar ent s were on the way .
They were very a ng ry which made it hard for me to make a right de c is ion .
Then s b called me and told me not to go to her home in case of that bad we a ther .
When I w a k ed up the w in d was still blow ing , just as my thought s .
This ta s te is like H E A V E N !
It ' s so o o o de l ic i ous !
: P
I c he c k ed my answer after the ex a m .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to see t ul i p s ga r d en s and w in d mi ll s .
I ' m here for the first time and I do n ' t know why but I de f in ite ly do n ' t know what I can write O o
So I tell you about my interest s ) ) )
F ir st ly , it ' s an im e ) ) ) I ' m interest ed in it about 4 or 5 year s .
It ' s do r a m as ) ) No t only J a p an e se but also K or e an , C h in e se and T a i w an e se ) No w I / m f a ll in l o ve with K or e an D or a m a `` You ' re beautiful `` with L e e H on g K i f e o m F T I s l and and J an g K e un S u k ( `` B a b y and me `` , `` B e e th o ve n v ir us `` ) .
And the th ir d addition is m us ic , es pe c i ally as i an ) I re ally l o ve K or e an m us ic , for ex amp le , D B S K / T VXQ / T O H O S H I N K I , S H I N e e , S up er J un i or and all their sub g ro up s , F ly to the S k y , F T I s l and e t c .
I usual ly go to b ook st or e d ur ing my da i ly walk .
T it le is `` G O A L `` .
I los t way to my ho u ce .
So , I called a tax y .
It co st s 1 0 0 0 0 yen .
T a x y is very ex p en s ive .
F or this reason , I ha te it .
How bu il d up the or g an i z ation s y s te m is one of the most im p or t ant de c is ion for comp an ies .
The se days , the f l at or g an i z ation has been consider ed one of the be st way s to mo t i v ate e m p l o y e es .
However , in my view , I f ir m ly believe that the somewhat f i er ce comp e t i tion from class if ic ation of e m p l o y e es and gra d es is ne ce s s ar y for the e f f ic i en c y of or g an i z ation s .
A b o ve all , as far as money is conc er n ed in this c a p it al is m so c i e ty , ra n k s are ne ce s s ar y for the e f f ic i en c y .
The reason that c a p it al is m so c i e t ies have been able to be de ve l op ed is the be l i e f that the we al th of ri ch es was proper ly comp en s at ed and this has mo t i v at ed people to str ive to follow them by work ing hard and de ve l op ing sp e c i al something .
G ive n comp an ies in c a p it al is m so c i e ty ; this case can also be a p p l i ed for the matter of ra n k s in business world .
If there is no different i ation about the con se qu ence of work , e m p l o y e es would think that there would be no need s for work .
I went home yesterday because of Q ing M ing .
To day I got up at 7 : 0 0 , then I asked m um to visit gr and p a .
Yes ter day , I ver if i ed so ur ce co d ing that us ing D ow J on es In d ust ri al In d e x .
I found that if D J I over 1 0 0 0 0 point then T S show s down to one de c im al place s , else if it show s down to two .
It should show 2 de c im al place s .
I ' m look ing for the reason why , and I have to set it show s c or re c t ly .
Why I live .
It ' s wonder .
I p re p ar ed the b re a k f a st for my d aught er and my hu s b and .
When they leave d , I began to c le an the room , do the was h ing , water the f l ow er and so on .
It is almost no on when I finish ed all of the house w or k .
No w is myself time .
I can watch favor ite dr a m a , or read b ook , or listen to the m us ic .
However , this time only last s three or four hour s .
Why there is not a ho l i day in house w or k ?
I could n ' t go English less on .
B e c a us e , I have made a mistake !
I was wrong in time .
( S t ar t at 1 0 : 4 0 but I went at 1 1 : 4 0 )

So I ' d like to b r us h up my English and G er man s k i ll .

look back the life in the U S
As I looked back on my life in the U S , there are so many things which ga ve me sh ock ed . , in other w or d s , the c ul t ur al sh ock s .
A t the first days I got to the U S , I me t people having se x in the bath ro o m .
I ' ve also me t three ga y people k is s ing at the same time at a part y .
O f course , the fact that most people ha b it u ally s m o ke we ed is also s ur p ri s ing for me .
O ther than them , c r a z y dr in k ing of co ll e g e students , and people who always keep the do or open when some on e is coming follow ing them are also some of those .
A l th ough those c ul t ur al di f f er ence s are to t ally new for me and some time s s c ar ed me , I ' ve always been try ing to a d a p t to the c ul ture of U S .
A fter that , I could find that I like this c ul ture , and I ' m more like an A m er ic an .
So far , my life in the U S is going well , but when it come s to me n tion ing about my English , I still never be sat is f i ed with mi ne .
To know more about people or the c ul ture , I ' ll try more .
But we almost got de la y ed the time t able because we had a tra f f ic con t ro l and there were many one way ro ad s .
F or t un ate ly we were there on time because of good dr ive .
I do a do u ble ma j or in business and ch in e se .
The reason I study a d u ble ma j or was because I could see the world was a head ing g l o b al e c on o m y and so c i e ty .
I w an n a get l ot s of va ri ous ex pe ri ence from people of different c ul ture .
As his p im p le s are get ting c le an , I expect ed the do c t or would give his the gr e en light to go to kind er g ar ten .
It is l o c at ed in the so u th of the J a p an and it is made up of a l ot of ti n y is l and s .
A l s o , O k in a w a is f a m ous in that it has many b a se ment s .
B e c a us e yesterday is my you ng er brother b ir th day .

A ll we can do is turn a b l in d e y e and have op t im is t ic view , may b e .
I w a k ed up at 7 A M this morning .
It ' s a beautiful morning g l ow .
But I feel a w ar m th , a p ow er and an en er g y from the s un .
When I saw a this morning scene , I thought all of things go to s m o o th ly to day .
A fter school , I went to the c ent re l i b r ar y in il a c with my s is ter .
And I st ud i ed for about 2 hour s and then I went to home .
When I and My s is ter c ook ed a s te a k , M ic ha el who is l and l or d to my house asked us , `` D id you bu y a desk ? `` we have n ' t b ough t a desk yet unti l that time .
So , We went to the I K E A to bu y a desk with M ic ha el after we had a dinner .
It took for 1 0 minute s by the c ar .
The I K E A was very big and there were many things such as desk , p i ll ow , d u ve t .
we b ough t two la p t op t able , re d and black .
It ' s about 4 0 E ur o that is reason able p ri ce .
A n y way , I b ough t a desk to day .
It ' s a little small , but It ' s enough t for me .
I ' m go n n a sha ng ha i world in ter n ation al ex po s i tion next month !
I ' m work ing at mo b i le p h on e c ar ri er in J a p an , like T - mo b i le in U S A .
They are sp on s or for S ha ng ha i world in ter n ation al ex po s i tion , and provide high t sp e ed mo b i le ne t w or k there .
This is my first time to visit in C h in a , I look ing for w ar d to do .
In fact , I would look for a friend who like s us ing S k y pe and M S N , and usual ly cha t s on S k y pe , I ho pe to cha t with him / her on S k y pe to im p ro ve my or al e ng l ish , and I will tea ch him / her P ut on g h u a , I can speak stand ar d P ut on g h u a , if I can find a friend like this , we can make a conc re t p l an to help each other , if he / she want s , ex c ept teaching ch in e se I also can tell her / him what he / she want s to know about C h in a .
why I am so e age r to im p ro ve my or al e ng l ish ?
because I will be on a bu s s i ness tri p to C h ic a g o .
I ho pe I will co m m un ic ate with the n at ive s effect ive ly .
so any body who want s to le ar n P ut on h u a and would help me , con ta c t me , than k s , I am on the line all the time .
O h h h h ~ ~ So great to know here : )
H o pe I can keep up le ar n ing no matter English or F re n ch . . .
I ' m now a s al es re p re s ent at ive who just gradua ted from un ive r s ity and p l an to study a b ro ad 2 year s la ter .
A n y way ~ enjoy and than k you !
The c r ow appeared soon and ga ve them a large p ot , then he explain ed : `` If you turn your l ad le to the right side in the p ot , it will give you P o l o [ 1 ] and if you turn it to the left side , the p ot will give you s te w [ 2 ] .
The old co up le ha p p i ly took the p ot home , they invite d all their ne i g h b or s and re l at ive s for dinner and they f ed them all .
Some days after that the j e al ous ne i g h b or request ed for the p ot saying that they had some gue st that night , the simple - heart ed old woman hand ed the p ot to him , but he never ga ve it back .
U n f or t un ate ly the v i ll age ' s K h an ' s s er v ant s w it ness ed the happen ing and took the don ke y by for ce as a k h an be l on g ing .
The co up le were so un ha p p y for los ing the c r ow ' s g if t , so they de c id ed to try the c r ow once more .
To day , I read one ar t ic le about many U .
ch il d re n are s u f f er ing from e ar in f e ction re c ent ly in U S A T O D A Y .
I was so s ad that they are s u f f er ing from the de ce a se .
And also , there are no effect ive treat ment against the de ce a se .
I ho pe this sit u ation will change better for the ch il d re n .
He was so dis a p po in ted to his c ur r ent circumstance that had been both er ing him .
I could n ' t do anything but only he ar his comp la in t .
But I ' m re ally gr ate ful if I could he al his s ad ness .
There would be good things and also bad things in our business life .
We c a n ' t be always in n ic e sit u ation .
I think that the im p or t ant thing to b re a k the difficult ies is keep ing your mind po s it ive what ever the circumstance is .
I saw new s about S l ut w al k in U S A and C an ad a .
The w ome n who was told ' do not walk like a s l ut ' by police in C an ad a have been a ng ry and la un ch ed c amp a i g n .
I think the police did it more care ful ly but they said the tru e .
The ir be ha v i or s are their ch o ic es , but there are n ' t only gentle me n in the world .
O ur ch o ic es de s er ve respect , but we should er the respon s i b il ity .
B as ic ally I wish the se x u al at ta c k s would be go ne out , However you know , I do not think it could be .
J ud as `` lady ga g a `` and tax ic `` b r t ne y sp e ar s ``
I like L ad y ga g a and b ri t ne y sp e as .
B e c a us e I think L ad y ga g a is po s it ive and un p re j ud ic ed person and b ri t ne y is se x y !
The one is J ud as and the other is T a x ic .
D e f in ite ly I tra n s la ted that w or d s though , but I do n ' t understand the mean ing s what they want to say .
When I was a un ive r s ity st ud ent , I was a me n b er of s k i tea m .
The end of over d r ive
I have finish ed my last ex a m , da m n , it so wonder ful !
It was very hard to do it with least co st .
Well , it look s like that it too tired me and I sit ting with b l o o d s h ot eyes at the comp ut er and I sleep y because went be d over 5 hour s than usual .
H a p p i ly I come d in my sen se s in time .
No w , this is time to re la x and f in ally have f un !
I just know it yesterday .
It is C an ad i an co f f e e sh op s .
They have a l ot of sh op s than star b a c k s co f f e e in C an ad a !
It is so difficult for me because I had n ' t know how to bu y and say in English . . .
A n y way , I should n ' t he s it ate just to bu y co f f e e ! !
so I de c id ed to ent er the co f f e e sh op !
I said `` a h - . . .
do u ble - do u ble ! ! ``
by the way , `` do u ble - do u ble `` mean s two s u g ar and two mi l k s ! !
I was told it by my ho st family !
I am ha p p y as if I am C an ad i an ! !
E ver y th ing will be my great pleasure s !
I me t some people in my A m er ic an friend ' s b ir th day dinner part y last even ing .
I me t my friend ' s friend s , my friend ' s c ous in , and c ous in ' s friend .

That girl s talk ed f a st .
I could n ' t catch up n at ive speak er ' s sp e ed .
My J a p an e se friend could catch up it .
I ' ve been stay ing here almost three month .
I spoke only gr e e ting yesterday .
I ' m usual ly talk at ive person , but I was re ally quiet yesterday .
I can understand in English .
A c t u ally , a sp e ed is im p or t ant for c as u al con ver s ation .
I still do n ' t a new job . . .
So , I ' ll go a in ter v i e w to night .
To m or r ow I ' ll go a in ter v i e w .
I ' m in a hu r ry . . .
I sure knew the di f f er ence of sp el ling between A m er ic an English and B ri t ish English .
But then , all people who I talk ed with there spoke f a st , and my understand ing for English was too poor , comp ar ing to the present .
( y es , I still have a poor command of English . . . )
How do most of A m er ic an people feel about B ri t ish English ?
W h i ch English do E ur o pe an people le ar n ?
P er ha p s , in J a p an we study A m er ic an English .
And g en er ally , the g l o b al stand ar d might be put on A m er ic an English .
Some on e , please tell me , what is the most di f f er ence between them ?
H i ~ ever on e
I have p r a c t ic e play ing ha r m on ic for two month s .

G o l d en week come s end of A p ri l .
My you ng s is ter is very very bu s y than I .
She is work ing a l ot of every day .
She always has a l ot of over work .
The over work is unti ll P M 1 0 : 0 0 .
Besides nothing day off .
I am very big g in er .
I think my di r ly need to c or re c t a l ot of .
However , this se m est er we have to mi x class es in a class ro o m .
S u ch as to day , we will have our class at 8 : 1 5 a m , I got there at 8 : 1 3 a m .
O h , my go d ! There are full of people in our class ro o m .
F or t un ate ly , my friend had left a sea t for me .
So I think I should be e ar ly er than before in my re st se m est er .
B e c a us e I ' m s c ar ed of mo s qu it o and ha te them .
My friend said because of my b l o o d ty pe .
We will have our class es from 8 : 1 5 to 1 2 : o o , and 1 4 : 4 0 to 1 6 : 1 0 .
I just have 1 1 class es every week .
The most class I like is P E , because I can play v o ll e y b a ll .
Y e a h , this is my f a v o ur ate sp or t .
If we have class , we must go , because the teacher will c he a k .
This is un like some other country .
One of my friend is a It al i an , and he can ch o o se if he want to go to school .
This punishment will make you could n ' t a p p ly the s ch o l ar s h i p .
But it ' s ex cited to c ook in you dormitory .
O k , this are some of my school .
I ' m re ally ha p p y to j o in in .
That was so e ar ly like a ch il d .
E ver y body say ' so many !
They are all girl and small do g .
The ir re l ation s are very good .
I think them re al my ch il d re n .
I should go to be d now ,
c u z I have class tomorrow 9 a m .
but I c a n ' t stop myself from T V s er ies ,
I found a new T V s er ies name d G h o st W h is p er ,
I start from S e as on four ,
but I think I can f i g ur e out the story .
it ' s about a woman who can see g h o st s and talk to them !
it ' s re ally co o l thought ,
but I rather be a normal person who C A N ' T see those g h o st .
if I can see g h o st ,
I wish I could me e t my go d m o ther ,
she pass ed away two year s a g o c u z some strange pro ble m about heart
it happen ed in a s ud d en ,
I have so many things want to say to her ,
I w an n a tell how much I l o ve her ,
and how much I a p p re c i ate to her ,
also I wish I could me e t my do g ,
it ' s the most c ut e and kind do g I ever me t ,
I mi s s it , I mi s s them both .
but no matter how ,
I think I should go to sleep !
A ll the train of Tokyo me t ro po l it an are a was comp le te ly stop p ed .
I was di cited to walk to home , about 2 0 k m , and did it .
D ur ing work ing , ce ll - p h on e did n ' t work d u e to the te le c o m c able was c ut by qu a ke .
What is w or se is that the bu s se s were too c r ow d ed to ri d e , and tax ies were also .
A fter I was home , I knew it was more serious at no r th e a st of J a p an a .
That ' s why I ' m here , to im p ro ve my English s k i ll and to s ur v ive a un ive r s ity life .
You can le ar n T ha i language in every day life in my t w it ter account , and you have a question .
I c a n ' t pass the entrance ex a m ( the un ive r s ity I want to ent er the be st ) .
In my sp ar e time , I ' d like to try to re la x myself .
S u ch as read ing some wonder ful no ve l s or watch ing a l ot of mo v ies with dr in k a tea .
bu ng e e j um p ing is a great past im e , because I like the feel ing it b r ing s to me ! I feel thoroughly re la x ed from the da i ly str es s .
In my world , there are good way to sp en d m y sp ar e time ^ 0 ^
I look for w ar d to do s k y pe .
This was my first j o in ing in a sight se e ing to ur a b ro ad .
I see m to have less en er g y than they .
However , you c a n ' t de n y how c r u el the re al world is .
A ll I can do is keep ing me on the right way and try ing to be ha p p y all the time .
The other day I tri ed T O E I C T est .
It ' s so far . . .

The town already has the number of the
old , the p op ul ation of the s up p or ting the old will be de c re as ed
w ow , this is my first po st and I still do n ' t have any idea what to write about .
I am le ar n ing in English and J a p an e se now and I ho pe every on e in this we b s ite can help me to im p ro ve .
It was difficult to up ro ot we ed s .
I have ex pe ri ence d C an ad i an N e w Y e ar for the first time .
I prefer C an ad i an N e w Y e ar to J a p an e se one .
B e c a us e the dinner is very go r g e ous and y um m y ! !
I do n ' t like J a p an e se tra d i tion al dis he s at N e w Y e ar .
I mean , s al t in l ow , f at in l ow . . .
The only thing I like in all is J a p an e se ri ce c a ke .
On the other hand , to day we had a l ot of f e a st s full of the t able .

M il k , eggs , s u g ar are mi x ed to g e ther .
M an y C an ad i an like this .
While that , I told about how we ce le b r ate N e w Y e ar in J a p an .
The mean ing s of each dis h , N e w year ' s g if t and so on .
They do n ' t have a c ust o m like N e w Y e ar ' s g if t .
That ' s what I like about J a p an e se N e w Y e ar .
There is a se v ent e en year s old girl .
She is called M i o .
One day , the girl has a ch ance to visit the no r ther n country .
She l o ve the at m o s p he re , so she str o ll through the for est every morning d ur ing stay ing .
She is usual str o ll ing the c amp us in the morning .

To p re v ent such a tra g ed y , to night we im p le ment ed A ut o S a ve D r a f t f e a ture .
This works like G M a il dr a f t s a ve f e a ture .
It ' s been a ut o s a v ed in every 3 0 second s after you start ty p ing .
If you want to s a ve man u ally just c l ic k `` S a ve as D r a f t `` but t on .
The comp ut er go es down ?
L o g back into `` W ri te a new ent ry `` p age and ch o o se the ent ry you were writing from `` D r a f t s `` corner in the left co l um n ( which I point ed out in the im age at ta ch ed this ent ry ) .

T O E I C t est
It take s 1 5 0 minute s con s is ting of the listen ing t est and the read ing t est .
We need to keep conc ent r at ing d ur ing it s long t est ing time .
I have been study ing a b it hard for it .
This is my four th t est .
I will do my be st in or d er to get a high s c or e on the ex a m .
The first three days of the new year
When I saw his picture , I felt like the time stop .
My friend said `` his works are wonder ful .
I like his picture . ``
I could R e la x and re fresh for this N e w Y e ar .
I ' m ma k ing to write the w or d s of a so ng .
How can I say to you ?
I ' ll never know the reason for our ex is ting .
It ' s ra in y sea s on at J un e in J a p an .
There is a bad we a ther all day ,
But while run n ing , the strong ra in s ud d en ly came f al ling ,
A l th ough I did n ' t have a co l d , I en c o un ter ed in a bad sit u ation .
I ho pe the ra in y sea s on will end e ar ly !
Yes ter day my friend s and I went to school , and got an English speak ing class .
We ' ve gradua ted from high school ( F e b . 8 was gradua tion ce re m on y ) in fact .
But we asked a teacher to make an English speak ing class even after the ce re m on y .
The class was very interest ing to us .
E s pe c i ally `` The G u es s ing G ame `` was so ! !
The game is to answer what is w ro te on the paper that is a b o ve answer er ' s head .
A no ther people give a hi n t to the answer er .
It is difficult to give a hi n t and answer .
A H and y C re ar F o l d er With in T e x t b ook ( B r us h ed up )
the walk ing with my b a g will be train ing for full f i ll my ability to c ar ry more we i g h t .
I c a n ' t get the s k i ll to c ar ry he a v y er b a g , ,
I copy my te x t b ook into f al f s i z e and so r t out the se to each per i o d .
When I come out from my house ,
I p ic k up the ne ce s s ar y part for one day study .
I put the se part s into a hu r f of ty p ing s i z e clear f o l d er .
I can put this clear f o l d er into all of my b a g s with a hu r f of ty p ing s i z e not e b ook .
So I got the op po t un ity to study on every sit u ation .
I think it is effect ive to in c re a se the f re qu en c y of study for get ting ne ce s s ar y s k i ll s .
Why do n ' t you make u b i qu i ous study ing en v ir on ment .
I have not go ne out at all when my school has been done . .
I feel that I want to go out or want to see my friend s though I do nothing in my home re c ent ly .
the first reason : I have a l ot of H .
W which I have not even start work ing yet .
the second s reason : N e ed to s a f e money unti l I gradua te .
Let me tell you what happen ed d ur ing week en d .
On s un day , I was very bu s y for p re p ar ing to sen d my students to their country , K or e a .
O ther teachers and I went to the a ir p or t , and we did some works for pro c ed ur es to ent er the a ir p or t ga te .
But we mi s s s ed !
we mi s s ed our are line .
We were l ate 1 0 minute s .
We be g g ed for help but st ud ent ' s sea t s
We came back home and wait ed for va c ant sea t s .
F or t un ate ly , the sea t s were enough to go all students going back to K or e a al th ough It took a quite long time .
The man g o p ud d ing which I of ten p ur ch a se con s is t s of four la y er s , each of a little different co l or and f la v or .
A ll the la y er s are in ha r m on y with into one ! !
It ' s the first time I visit this sit e
A fter two month , I have to be in ter v i e w ed in English to ent er a comp an y
M an y time , I only listen and read .
I think that the reason why I c a n ' t speak and write English
I sea r ch ed to find a good we b s ite to help me study English and f in ally I found this sit e
I ' ll help those who want to study K or e an and I need you help
s the follow ing sen t ence is gra m m at ic ally right ?
We are the came r a c l u b me m b er s .
We will try to j o in t p ur ch a se a new came r a , and perform ance a good one .
It ' s all good but too ex p en s ive .
I think that it see m s to like a good small and c he a p .
How does a per c ent age dis c o un t it ex p en s ive ?
D o you a little b it more dis c o un t ?
So this let ' s de c is ion .
1 7 / 1 0 / 1 0 - B B Q at a P ar k
We were p l an ing to go to the Z o o , but every on e was bu s y work ing .
So we c ance ll ed .
S in ce it was s un n y , I went to the near est p ar k with my room m ate in s te ad .
We did B B Q at the p ar k , C le l and P ar k .
The p ar k is e qu i p p ed with a he ar de v ic e , so unless we c le an it after eat ing , we can us e I suppose .
In addition , There is some ten n is co ur t s next to the p ar k !
I always feel like play ing it al th ough I can not play well .
We talk ed about the job in each country and mar ri age able age .
I am not sure that we can dr in k in public place .
In j a p an , it is O K .
How about your country ?
To day , I le ar n ed was h ing a machi ne of ga st ro c ame r a in my c l in ic for the first time .
A ll this time I was very serious for do n ' t f a ll down it .
B e c a us e I heard that my do c t or b ough t it about 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 J P Y .
So it is very ex p en c ive .
I was re ally surprise d it .
It will be able to bu y a c ar if I had such a big money .
And I c a n ' t help me if I f a ll down it .
So that I am very serious to was h it .
And I enjoy ed was h ing the came r a .
I always ha p p y do ing work .
Well ,
My friend girl will be mar ri g e this year in the M on t an a .
She is one of my close friend but it look s like you ng er s is ter or family so I have been feel ing ha p p y for it .
I will be there when she has We d d ing ce re m on y .
Yes ter day , I started to write my j o ur n al , but no body c he c k that .
or the them e is only just b or ing .
To day , I went to sh op p ing to bu y ch o c o l ate .
M o st J a p an e se like sweet ta s te ch o c o l ate with c ook i e something .
On ly ch o c o l ate is not so at t r a c t ive for most j a p an e se .
B e c a us e J a p an e se like c ar b o h y d r ate s .
As you already know , they always eat ri ce and noodle as s ta p le f o o d .
So , I think that ' s why J a p an e se like to eat something with c ar b o h y d r ate s .
There f or e , M o st J a p an e se like sweet ta s te ch o c o l ate with c ook i e .
F ir st , I study English for three hour s every day as po s i ble as after work .
A l th ough you know it is the in e v it able natural pro ce s s , it is hard not to think about it too much .
My father is 5 5 year s old this year , in s te ad of pay ing at ten tion to keep he al th y by ex er c is e like pe er s , my father like sp en d ing l ot s of time b r ow s ing new s on the in ter ne t .
I re ally wish all those a g ing pro ce s s can be s l ow ed down or at least not that not ic e able , but the fact is that I can clear ly and strong ly sen se them , which is re ally pai n ful .
We took a bath e ar ly , and at e to s h i k o s h i - so b a , the bu c k w he at noodle s eat en on N e e w Y e ar ' s E ve .
There f or e now I can take my time .
My ne i g h b or s he l d a part y and I am he ar ing L at in m us ic since this after no on .
It started ra in ing a while a g o , but the m us ic does n ' t stop sound .
I part ic i p at ed in a ma t ch of the ten n is to day .
I be l on g to the comp an y ' s ten n is tea m , and to day was a open ing ma t ch for this sea s on .
We w on the first set but we los t second set .
F in ally , we los t f in al set .
It was so close ma t ch and we play ed about 2 hour s and half .
And I felt the s ting of de f e c t because we los t such a close game .
I ' ll p re p ar e better for the next week ma t ch .
P la y ing ten n is is so f un and re l i e ve my str es s .

D o you know ' L ad y O s c ar : R o se of V er s a il le s ' .
But she does like a man , because her ' s p ar ent )
She look s like per f e c t for me when I was you ng .
I think , she was very strong , n ic e , and hand s ome ( or pretty )
even though was girl .
My English name ' O s c ar ' ,
It re c a ll s re m e m b r ance to my mind .
The star r ing of it is J o h n n y D e p p .
This mo v i e start s when J ame s M at th e w B ar ri e , an English dr a m at is t , me e t s the bo y who is mo d el of P e ter P an .
I did n ' t know about how `` P e ter P an `` was written , so this story was so in ter st ing .
I ' ll have l ot s of time to le ar n English next month .
B e c a us e the b an qu e t room s I work will be va c ant on the month .
It ' s a good thing , unless s a v ed money will be di m in ish ing without me r c y .
It ' s not that I ' m not sat is f i ed with time and money I have ,
but it ' s a b it short of feel ing we al th i ness .
I think the reason is what my c ur r ent job is not the job I re ally l o ve .
A l th ough I do n ' t ha te my job , rather I like my co ll e a gue s .
But I a v o id ed the hard s h i p , as a re s ul t , I stand this place .
I ' m no long er you ng to change my job .
That is English .
It ' s my home w or k to English w ri t ting sub j e c t .
Let me in t ro d u ce my s el f .
I In ch e on U n ive r s ity a st ud ent and ma j or I nformation co m m un ic ation sub j e c t in I nformation te ch no l o g y .
My f a im i ly number is 4 and comp ri s ing father , mother , old brother , me .
My father is dr ive r of a bu s and my mother is house w if e .
A l s o My old brother is a K on g j u U n ive r s ut y a st ud ent and ma j or is to ur is m .
He p re p ar e for va ri ous con t est .
When second half - year , I always p l an to what I can do next year .
I some time s heard that `` You l o ve p l an ~ `` , I read ing b ook s that re l at ive my future and I favor ite C E O is ' S te ve n job ' s ' to A p p le comp an y C E O .
So I read b ook s to re l at ive S te ve n job ' s .
I like f i ction b ook that J a p an f i ction b ook s .
So I in c re a se my ex pe ri ence mo b i le s k i ll to found my se c re t pass ion .
B e c a us e I was called the un ive r s ity .
The un ive r s ity said I pass ed the ent r a ce ex a m in ation .
I will look f ow ar d to un ive r s ity life .
No w 2 2 : 0 0 o ' clock .
To m or r ow is will be bu s y .

It is w in d y since last night .
I can feel w in d s a little inside the a p ar t ment even all the w in d ow s are close d , since my a p ar t ment is old .
So he will gradua te j un i or high school and ent er a high school this year .
They take the ex a m to ent er a high school .
My father worry about him .
But there is a large number of un k n ow n v o c a b ul ar ies in the b ook , I can gue s s to some ex t ent or cha ll e ng e to understand those mean ing s though : s
I ' m p u z z led to think when I finish read ing this b ook : x
I have us ed a co up le of we b b r ow s er s which are In ter ne t ex p l or er , F i re f o x , S a f ar i and G o o g le ch r ome .
I can s a ve the time and feel co m f or t able .
B es id e , us er friend ly in ter f a ce is at t r a c t ive .
But some time I am an no y ed by b i z ar re op tion s .
A c t u ally , I was n ' t able to see p d f f il es by ch r ome .
F in ally , I so l v ed the is s u e to ent er some ke y w or d into address b ar and ch o se en able to see p d f by C h r ome .
F or now , there is no comp la in about C h r ome .
C o ul d you tell me how different the se two express ion :
M or e o ver , I read an English - tra n s la ted J a p an e se co m ic and in the man g a , a character say s like this :
( This is for m my me m or y , so may b e some co m m as but I do n ' t have the co m ic to con f ir m now )
D if f er ence in how to us e sub j e c t s and c ar d in al number s between # 1 ~ # 3 is not clear to me .
in my comp an y
E ver y on e want to be N O 1 .
So some time s , c a n ' t care comp an y .
I want to enjoy every day .
My bo s s said for me `` F in ish ed of this job unti l next T u es day `` .
This job is almost finish ed , but there is a little of mistake s .
I do not know what my mistake .
A th e le t ' s feet
I ' ve got at he le t ' s f o ot .
It started long time a g o , It was about my high s ch o o l days that I first got at he le t ' s f o ot So it has been almost a de c ad e .
But I ne g le c ted to treat them .
I of ten feel it ch between to es .
I de c id ed that I do n ' t need to let them be .
So I went to a de m ot o l o g is t in down t ow n .
He p re s c ri b ed me an o in t ment and let me have p u ll my b l o o d for live r t est .
The do c t or look s care ful and probab ly credit able but since I am for now tra n s la ting one do c d or ' s b ook which c ri t ic i z e do c t or s who are easily `` put ting their p at i ent s on c he m ical s `` I am a b it n er v ous .
But I have no ch o ic e for my c le an feet in a short ter m .
I will f a i th ful ly follow his in st r u ction first .
The public he al th care in s ur ance took charge way more than half of the to t al me d ic in e b i ll .
A n y way s , I ho pe this s um m er I can we ar f a b ul ous s and al s to bo a st c ut e to es and c le an feet .
I feel very tired and s ad the se days , there are so many ex a m s to p re p ar e , which are rather difficult .
D o y o u know `` mi k k b o u z u `` J a p an e se w or d ?
`` M i k k a b o u z u `` mean s that man c a n ' t st ic k anything for long .
This w or d a p p ly to me .
I am g en u in fool .
I am going to con t in u e to write this di ar y and im p ro ve my English s k i ll , next time .
B y the way , how should I do to make for e i g n friend ?
While I work ed outside with a down j a c ke t , I sh ive r d in a co l d w in d .
So I `` m going to be d with re l i e f ! !
I heard the s ad new s about my friend s .
This s ad new s is that my friend s qu it his job .
He is us ed to work bu s i ly and had not spoke n his dis t re s s about his comp an y .
I saw a mo v i e

When he was 1 7 , he gradua ted from M I T , one of the most f a m ous in st it ut e in the world .
It show s us va ri ous character of M J .
`` The way you make me feel `` , he seemed in no c ent as a ch il d .
`` C a n ' t stop l o v ing you `` , he was tender and full of l o ve .
`` B i ll i e J e an `` , he was a b s o l ut e ly se x y !
`` M an in the mi r r or `` , he was a tru e s up er star .
I c ri ed so much and it cause d me head a ch e .
I want to say than k you to K en n y O r te g a ( the direct or ) for sh ar ing us such a great scene s behind the st age .

H is so n has no friend because he live s in a mi l it ar y are a with his family , not even he does not have a s is ter or brother .
He want s to make a friend , but it is n ' t that easy .
He felt very b or ed of play ing everything alone , he de c id ed to go some place where his father said to him not to go never ever .
He became s c ar ed of the place , he came back home .
One day la ter , he visit ed there again .
He me t a bo y who looked like almost the same age as him .
They talk ed to each other , became friend s .
He became a w ar e that his friend does n ' t have enough f o o d , so he brought f o o d every day for his friend .
They talk ed a l ot about their own life .
F in ally , he visit ed his friend ' s house , and the thing happen ed in that day .
H is so n felt co l d because there was no he at ing a p p ar at us .
He told this friend that he want ed to go back home .
A fter one day , H it l er and his w if e not ic ed his so n did n ' t sleep in his be d last night .
They started w a il ing , and the mo v i e finish ed .
That ' s what I re m e m b er ed about this mo v i e ' s story .

I l o ve the for g e in er so much .

that ` s why , im le ar n ing e ng l ish .
This is because I ' d l o ve to visit to T A I W A N .
I have ever tri ed to study M and ar in when I was in the j o un i or high s ch o o l .
C h in e se - cha r a c t or s are us ed in M and ar in and J a p an e se , so I thought le ar n ing M and ar in is a l ot e as i er than le ar n ing any other language s .
Some of mean ing of ch in e se - cha r a c t or s in M and ar in and J a p an e se are same but some of things are not .
it made me compli c at ed .
A l th ough , M and ar in has four a c c ent s in one sound ( I c a n ' t explain about it c re a ly in English , try to understand ! ) .
The se reason , I left from M and ar in in a week .
It ' s should be great man ! `` .
I ' m sure that the time is for K things c ur r ent ly , but T a i w an has many appeal s ; like c ul ture s ( es pe c i ally for you ng people ) , f o o d s and tra d i tion s .
So , how can I start to le ar n ing M and ar in first ?
The number of di ed or mi s s ing people are est im at ed more than 33 0 0 at present .
The di v is ion direct or of M i y a g i P re f e c t ur al P o l ic e say s v ic t im s might be more than ten th ous and s .
I had C h i j im i and ra w e g g ro ll s for dinner .
C h i j im i was too hot , because I put too much K im ch i in it , but ra w e g g ro ll s were good .
My you ng er d aught er help ed me ma k ing ra w e g g ro ll s .
We p re p ar ed let t us , c u c um b er , be an sp ro ut s , ch ic k en , sh ri m p s and la b i ate for it .
She got the k n a c k in no time and she was good at w r a p p ing it after all .
That was beautiful .
I should ' ve take n picture s of this .

I want to be speak English f l u ent ly and co m m un ic ate any body all over the world .
I think I ' m va ry la z y about everything .
I off en po st po ne va ri ous things have to do .
The time le ng th people can live has be limit ed , so how much I can do in that time .
When I think so , I c a n ' t was te time at all .
She was f at but now she is s m ar t .
I afraid to speak in English
I had a dinner with my friend s and some of their friend s yesterday .
One of my friend s just came back from F re n ch before yesterday , and other one is good in English , and their friend s are also good in English so when I me t then , I was s ur r ound ed by English .
I can understand half of what they talk about but it ' s hard to respon se to them for me .
But I had a n ic e night in de ad because they do so n ic e to people ^ ^
How to over c ome speak ing English with people es pe c i ally with like A m er ic an and E ur o pe an ?
D o you have some me th o d s can provide me because I think my English is poor : (
To day was fine day .
I went to ta m a ri ver c y c ling .
I was re st ing by ri ver side , when c at s a p p ro a ch ed me .
So I r u b b ed the c at s .
He ' s less on is mo v ing my heart .
I will try to write English .
But No r th J a p an have d ame g ed e ar th qu a ke .
We will do my be st .
I b ough t new P C .
It was so ex c it ing ex pe ri ence ! !
I a p p ly ed for a job which is a re ce p tion is t in English school .
I found out the job off er in an English free paper .
It ' s a part time job .
W or k ing time is only 1 day a week .
I ' m house w if e , so it ' s con v in i ent for me to do such a short time job .
A c t u ally , I have no purpose to study English hard , so if I got some job which require d some English s k i ll , I could im p ro ve my English , I thought .
A t in ter v i e w ,
What ' s is your we a k po ing in your job
I s it a v a il able for me to a d j ust your work ing time depend ing on students ' con ve n i ence ?
I was so up se t when I was asked that , because I had no p re p er ation for the job in ter v i e w .
So I could n ' t p re ten d to be s m ar t at all , I mean , I answer d it just honest ly .
but some on e around me always tell me that they can feel at e a se after talk ing with me .
B e c a us e probab ly I can listen to them very well , that ' s why they can
feel re la x with me .
I ' m e age r to do something which I ' m interest ed in , but some time s I los t my mo t i v ation ra p id ly .
I ' m not go n n a go a b ro ad , I have no p l an to live a b ro ad , because I ' m house w if e , It ' s difficult for me so far .
O f c o ur se I can ar r an g e my time to s u it st ud ent ' s sit u ation .
I will keep every T h ir s day for your students .
That ' s my answer s .
What do you think if you were the in ter v i e w er who own ed a co z y English school .
To day he went a n ur se ly school .
In ch il d h o o d in our c ity L e g o so l d at bo x with M il k y W a y only and there were from 1 0 to 2 0 de ta il s , but from the se de ta il s I con st r u c ted so many different things , that already s c ar es .
1 0 year s have pass ed but play in the con st r u c t or still want , because M in e c r a f t ent h r al led me more than W or l d of W ar c r a f t .
F e el myself like a kid which ga ve mi ll ion de ta il s for L e g o .

I ' m writing this ar t ic le to im p ro ve my a c ad e m ic writing ability .

I agree that make the s m o k ing are a and re st ri c t s m o k er s to s m o ke only there .
In addition , pass ive s m o k ing has been said to have most ne g at ive effect among all effect s of s m o k ing .
It is a p ity that many people are affect ed by the second h and s m o ke , al th ough they do not s m o ke and try to care care of their body .
We started a new pro c ed ur e from 1 994 .
This pro c ed ur e is s up er i or to a con ve n tion al b re a st p re s er v ing s ur g er y .
To day ' s my to p ic is about dance .
D o es every on e know any about dance ? ?
No w a day da n c ing has a l ot s of style so we can tell the di f f er ence between `` old school `` and `` new school `` about da n c ing .
O l d school has many p op ul ar style that you may have ever heard before .
`` B re a k in `` , `` P op p in `` , `` L ock in `` and `` H i p - H op `` are old school dance which style became f a m ous in 1 97 0 ' s - 1 9 8 0 ' s .
P op p in is my be st da n c ing style w h ch mo ve ment s are so f re a k y .
I re c ome n d ed you to watch this dance if you interest ed in it or you have never watch ed it .
N e w school dance became p op ul ar in 1 99 0 ' s .
I do n ' t know about the se because the se style ' s history is not much as de e p as old school , so I just know the conc ept that `` make own mo ve s what ever you like `` .
If any body want s to know more about dance , co ment me please !
F in ally , T h an k s for read ing such a b or ing di ar y .
Then she j um p ed from the to i le t and started to run away like a d u c k with her di a p er at her an k le s .
It could all ow people to live de light ful live s .
There is a ho st of fact or s le ad to job sat is f a ction .
P ro v id ed that a person work ed in a no is y and c r amp ed room , it is less like ly to sat is f y his job ; there f or e , good en v ir on ment is require d .
The e m p l o y er s could e qu i p their office with so p h is t ic at ed f a c il it ies as possible as they can , in or d er to a f f or d work er s co m f or t and con ve n i ent .
There is no need for the bo s s to look his s ta f f s over their should er s .
In addition , c or p or ation s can , every so of ten , or g an i z e some c re ation al act i v it ies , which may let the work er feel a sen se of be l on g ing .
It is g en er ally accept ed that people want to be re c o g n i z ed on their work .
In this case , the se e m p l o y e es would feel ent h us i a st ic and mo t i v at ed without feel ing their work mo no t on ous .
When an in d i v id u al perform ex ce p tion ally on his work , the re w ar d ing would in s p i re him to be more di l i g ent , and this , in turn , will be ne f it the comp an y .

So I am consider ing to make a not e for this , so I can see my mistake s and I can re v i e w .
I know some my pro ble m s , but it is not easy to c or re c t them when I speak or write in English .
L e ar n ing language is not easy .
It take s time , is n ' t it ?
0 3 0 9 D e c id e to quite my job
I came to feel pai n in my back so I de c id ed to as k my bo s s to less en my work ing hour s .
When I told him he told me he need a person who can work from 6 to 2 without b re a k and asked me that I would like to c ar ry on or not .
I had to de c id e at the moment .
I thought my he al th was more im p or t ant and it was just c as u al job .
A fter our con ver s ation , I told my co w or k er about that .
He show ed his un ha p p y .
M o v able T y pe H a c k - a - so n
I part ic i p at ed in the we b de ve l op er s even t at last S at r u day .
It was called `` M o v able T y pe H a c k - a - so n `` , a de ve l op ing even t of b l o g g ing so f t w ar e called `` M o v able T y pe `` ( here in a fter `` M T `` ) .
M T is a f a m ous so f t w ar e for b l o g g ing , but now a day s it is f re qu ent ly us ed as a C M S so f t w ar e in J a p an .
M T is also know n as a ri v al so f t w ar e of W or d P re s s .
I us e both so f t w ar e , but now I ten d to us e M T for my job .
I de ve l op ed some work f l ow p l u g in .
The people who ga ther ed at the even t were re ally a w es ome de ve l op er s , and I would not be able to pass them in de ve l op ing e ter n ally - y es , they were re ally re ally great de ve l op er s .
I was invite d for the b ir th day part y .
In fact , I me t her for the first time the other day .
I mo v ed in this v i ll age last a p ri l , so it is good for me to co m m un ic ate with a new people .
It was very f an .
A fter we s an g , she pay ed almost all money .
I said I pay money but she re f us ed it .
In J a p an , we ten d to treat for the person who has a b ir th day .
It is a j a p an e se manner .
But , in for e i g h country , the person who has a b ir th day treat the gue st ?
B y the way , my j a p an e se friend in F r ance had a dinner as his friend ' s T a i w an a is mar i age part y .
He propos ed all of gue st s ( 4 people ) to treat for this co up le because it ' s mar i age part y .
E ver y on e pay money for this co up le but he was re p ro a ch ed by 4 gue st s why they must pay money for a co up le .
This is because it was the co up le who made this p l an .
In for e i g h country , it ' s not normal ?
I have a part time job to day .
There are l ot s of n ation al ity .
There are l ot s of different country people living in A u c k l and .
I like here .
The reason why I like here because It is o k if I am di f f er ence from other s .
O ther thing what I like that people are re ally re la x ing and saying `` D o n ' t worry about it `` when I made a something mistake .
We might have a mi s un d er st and ing each other some time s because we came from different country and different idea s .
But I want to try understand di f f er ence s as much as I can .
I never le an ed about di f f er ence s when I was in J a p an .
This is a great op p or t un ity to get it for me .
This is my di ar y for the first time .
I am high st ud ent and first gra d e in J a p an .
I am going to visit A ust r al i a on my school ex c ur c ion next F e b r u ar y .
So , I want to im p ro ve my English s k i ll and know A ust r al i an an c ul ture .
S in ce ty p h o on tra ver s ed j a p an , it ' s get ting co o l so s te e p ly ! !
I feel that f a ll does ' t come to J a p an this year , which every body know s there are four clear ly se p ar at ed sea s on s .
A ccord ing to a story , when the new s c aster said that a ut um n has n ' t ar ri v ed
this year , a bo y who w ar b or n in O c t , in short b or n in a ut um n , w or ri es that he w o n ' t be
ce le b r at ed his b ir th day .
What ch il d re n say and act , always am us es us .
When I go sh op p ing , most of my p ur ch as es are conc er n ing we ar s .
Even though I ma j or in e c on o m ic , one of my dr e a m s is to be
through the job in v o l v ing e c on o m ic or f in ance .
L a st , I found a fashion b l and `` mi k i `` .
I just keep go for w ar d ! !
I always us e i P o d to u ch , which is not most re c ent one but so - called 2 0 0 9 la ter .
It ' s us e ful to c he c k e m a il , t w it ter , we a ther for e c a st , c a p it al mar ke t and so on .
B e c a us e it take s time to bo ot P C , I of ten us e i P o d in s te ad , es pe c i ally in the morning .
But to day it has something wrong .
F or in st ance , it require s me to in p ut pass w or d t w ic e to un l ock .
I re b o ot ed it but it ' s still wrong .
So now I ' m re c o ver ing v i a i T un es .
M a y b e I need to set it up again and it would take time , s i g h .
N ic e to me e t you all of you .
I am j a p an e se .

I ho pe it w o n ' t let them more s u f f er : (
This te m p ro ry job end s on the end of this month .
It is un c o m f or t able to stay in un f a m il i er place .
The w or st difficult y about being here is f o o d .
I take good care of my comp le x ion by tak ing a l ot of ve g e t able s and not tak ing bad f o o d .
So I had my bo s s bu y some ve se t able s for me .
A fter I re c i e v ed them last night , I kept them in the re f ri g er at er .
But this morning , I found the f ro z en ve g e t able s in the re f ri g er at or .
If comp an y bu il d a large fact or y near our co m m un ity , it make s job op p or t un ity around c ity .
However , it may cause a ir or w at ter po ll u tion and no is e which come from fact or y dis po s al .
L ook at C h in a they are ty p ical ex amp le .
So first , our co m m un ity have to think about a d v ant age s and dis ad v ant age s in a d v ance .
I think I s up p or t the fact or y though I w o n ' t work for there .
It ' s be c u a se that I ' m still re la ted with them .
It make s business re c o ver y .

I c a n ' t write this well .
What do you as s o c i ate with when you are asked ?
I as s um e you think you are asked your ce ll p h on e number .
That p h r a se is what I had said to the c ust ome r s over the co un ter when I as k them to ent er their P I N for their de b it c ar d s .
It is e m b ar r as s ed to say , I ' d never re c o g n i z ed this fault .
One day a lady laugh ed after I said this p h r a se .
I could n ' t catch her but I wonder ed why she laugh ed , of course .
I asked my C an ad i an friend s about the reason .
They said , `` M a y b e she said , do you want my ce ll p h on e number ?
You r question is ex a c t ly we ir d . ``
No w , in s te ad of that , I say `` C an you please ent er ( or put ) your number ? `` I am very afraid that there are another wrong sen t ence s I insist they are c or re c t .
As if the sen t ence is c or re c t for the gra m m ar , to be wrong po s s i b ly o c c ur when I us e that sen t ence in the wrong sit u ation .
But I could not ic e the wrong way .
That think ing make s me speak l ow .
I know it ' s not good ha b it .
B y the way , `` could I have your sign a ture on it ? `` ( as point ing the re ce i p t ) This is c or re c t , is n ' t it ? ?
C er a m ic s c l u b .
He entered an or g an i z ation for our c l u b .

But , there are circumstance s at the or g n i z ation .
He was not sat is f i ed that s y s te m .
He dis like d going the job s .

B e c a us e since he con t in u es this c l u b , he must go the job .
He leave our c l u b .
I at ten d the i g o class to day .
But soon , one of the f r ance se come to tea ch us
because he has le ar n ed i g o before ,
so he told us some point about i g o .
A fter that , I think my i g o te ch n i qu e is a little better .
T h an k you very much

I re ally would l o ve to im p ro ve my pai n ting s k i ll s more .
So , I have to p r a c t ic e much further !
I st ud i ed about the qu al ity con t ro l for my t est .
The Q C is very interest ing ! !
It is a s y s te m to make fine good s require d by B u y er in e c on o m ic ally .
I think the B u y er is always require fine good s , but the man u f a c ture r want to make good s in l ow co st .
The re l ation of them is never change .
What is the thing to ful f i ll the B u y er ?
In the morning I so le m n ly s w e ar that I will go to sleep at 1 0 p m , at 1 1 at l ate st .
If I sleep 4 - 5 hour s in the night d ur ing the who le week I will have to want to go to sleep in the even ing , have n ' t I ?
And then morning is and `` Some body , k i ll me ! ``
what is di f f er ence between `` you know `` and `` you know what ``
She know s , how I ha te when the people with who m I ' m in close co m m un ion do like this ! !
She ' s not my friend , I just do n ' t know the w or d in e ng l ish which I may us e in th is sit u ation . .
We are n ' t friend s and I was tru st ing her ti ll the se days only for one half , but know . . .
I know ex a c t ly that I do n ' t want to be with her almost - friend s ( may b e , fellows ?
To day ' s high est te m p er a ture was 3 5 de g re es in O s a k a .
We have to s a ve on e le c t ri c ity because n u c le ar p ow er p l ant s are n ' t run n ing d u e to the a c c id ent of F u ku s h im a .
So we us e a ir - condition er as little as possible .
I worry that old people and ch il d re n will di e of he at str o ke .
I he ar that 4 people de ad of he at str o ke in J a p an to day . . .
I went to K in k i U n ive r s ity and co m m un ic at ed people who be l on g ed to other un ive r s it ies .
Yes ter day ' s even t was `` de b ate `` .
We de b at ed about `` S h o ul d J a p an e se go ver n ment raise con s um p tion tax , or not `` .
I was the op po s i tion side , and had to ar gue that J a p an e se go ver n ment should n ' t raise con s um p tion tax .
I could re f ut e the ri v al ' s ar g u ment , but could n ' t speech my ar g u ment l o g ic ally .
I ' m neither us ed to speak ing in comp an y no r speak ing in English .
A fter all I w on the de b ate , but I made some mistake s .
I have to p r a c t ic e hard more .
He re in J a p an , an u al even t s with a family re un ion are only sh o g at s u ( same as the ha p p y new year even t ) and o b on ( which is he l d in the me d d le of A u g ust ) .
S h ock ng i ly my room that I us ed to us e became my father ' s ho b b y room , so I sp ent a time and s l ept in the gue st room but that was not so un c o m f or t able .
that was so great and too many to eat .
`` S a p po ro S n ow F est i v al `` is one of big and f a m ous w in ter even t in J a p an .
S a p po ro is in H o k k a id o P re f e c ture , it is no r th J a p an .
I have n ' t ever go ne there .
The first di ar y
It is V al ent in e soon .
I made ch o c o l ate to day .
The s light ly e ar ly reason is because I go to Tokyo from 1 4 th .
But I must ta s te .
I eat ch o c o l ate now and feel sick .
to study and get ch o c o l ate , what do you do ?
I say that I dis like it clear ly , and is not it r ud e ?
My d aught er has got a r ash because she to u ch ed some in se c t s on the g la s s are a .
So I can enjoy s n ow scene ^ ^
I ha te a co l d , But I like s n ow scene s ! ! < 3
If your answer is `` Y E S `` , may b e you like a view of my town ! ! * ^ ^ *
I think it is n ' t a mo v i e for ch il d re n !
It ' s a good mo v i e and I like it .
But I want ed to watch a ha p p y mo v i e to day .
I want to make friend s with other country , s people .
because my e ng l ish is not very good , but I am work ing on it .
I believe I will good at it .
My friend had an i P h on e , I en v i ed her .
I do n ' t know very well how to us e it yet .
I called and sen t ma il s to my friend s .
P le a se tell me if you have your re c o m m en d able a p p l ic ation s .
A fter class es , I have meeting with students .
I ' ve never see n it before , because I ' m not interest ed in A n im e at all .
P ic ture 2 : A co s p la y ed girl in front of G un d a m C a f e .
She is c ut e , is n ' t it ?
O f course I ' m so interest ed in her .
( A man re f le c ted on the w in d ow is me .
I st u c k in a tra f f ic j a m on the way home from work .
I would n ' t re c o m m en d that comp le te s il ly mo v i e , but , to be honest , I like d it .
It ' s about the office I ' m work ing .
I like to watch c ar t o on and some time I like watch j a p an c ar t o on with my you ng er brother .
F ir st time I did n ' t want see c ar t o on because I did n ' t know F un n y c ar t o on and mo v ies .
I can draw a ar t and c ar t o on her o s .
So c ar t o on ar ter s work hard ly every c ar t o on I l o ve To m and j er ry
I sp en d so good time in Tokyo that I am very tired .
I do n ' t have time to take a re st b a c a us e I have a l ot of re p or t to write by S at ur day .
I ho pe that I do n ' t have to sleep unti l I finish them all . . .
And now I ' m not s st ud ent any m or e . .
I have teaching j a p an e se class .

I do n ' t like a ra in y day , so I was ha p p y to day .
What we a ther is it in your country now ?
The c ity was l ock ed up . ( No th ing get s in , nothing get s out ) .
It ' s an im p or t ant pro f es s ion n al c y c le ra ce .
As I never work on w ed ne s day , I could at ten d the run n ing ra ce .
I le ar n English , because English are a g l o b al language .
I think , that I will all ow ed to le ar n this language and we help me in this )
if you could change once a moment in your past , what would you ch o o se ?
in my case , I may go back to 2 0 0 5 .
A t that time , I was in C h in a for study ing ch in e se .
I had l ot s of op p or t un ity to have something f un and make f re in d s , however I did not know it is p re c i ous then .
The gr and p ri x of J a p an of M ot o G P is a la ter this week .
I r ent a room at In d i an ' s house , and there is an In d on es i an ma id .
No w she is re ally st u c k because the l and l or d has n ' t all ow ed her to con ta c t her family in In d on es i a since she came here .
I do n ' t understand the ma id s y s te m ( I think honest ly that hi r ing ma id it s el f is against the hu man right even if both ho pe so ) .
It ' s quite ri d ic ul ous to pro h i b it her to call , ma il , have a mo b i le p h on e even though I have no idea about In d i an way of think ing or their co m m on s ence ( or this is not about In d i an people but just my l and l or d in d i v is u al ) .
I can have her us e my p h on e or P C , but is it no good ?
I do n ' t understand why it is a pro ble m to her con ta c t her family .
Besides my l and l or d c a n ' t speak English at all and I c a n ' t T a m il either .
I do n ' t like any trouble , but should I do something for her ? ?

The reason of study English
I have been study ing English for 6 month .
I want to take a s c or e 6 . 0 by I E L T S .
My writing s c or e is 4 . 5 , and I have to study more .
If I took the s c or e 6 . 0 , I could go to O E T p re p ar ation school in S y d ne y .
I want to know how I can write a English es s a y in f l u en c y .
M or e o ver , the more one le ar n s the e as i er he find s it to a c qu i re good le ar n ing s k i ll s .
And the more he p r a c t is es his le ar n ing style the quick er he le ar n s .
P er s on ally I have been le ar n ing English since e ar ly ch il d h o o d .
In those days all I want ed was just to know a f e w w or d s so that to say just a f e w sen t ence s in class .
My first a u th ent ic re s o ur ce s were ' T h re e M en in a B o at ' , ' The G o d f a ther ' , ' G re at G at s b y ' , ' How to S te al a M i ll ion ' , ' ' S n ow W h ite and S e ve n D w ar f s ' .
M an y year s have pass ed since that time .
I ' m still le ar n ing English .
No w that I am a gr ow n up and know what my le ar n ing style act u ally is , I can le ar n a great de al more at a time .
H aving been mo t i v at ed in high school I think I can hard ly stop le ar n ing now as I believe there is no end m aster ing English .
T h an k s for you t help to im p ro ve this pass age .
The man , however , s u ed his ex - girl f ri en d and f il ed a claim for all the g if t s he ga ve , which includ es 5 pack s of d um p ling , bu g z a p p er , b ir th day c a ke s , S P A far e , high - sp e ed train ti c ke t s and v it a m in .
Besides , he also asked for me d ical fee and ment al comp en s ation , which am o un t s to 1 0 0 0 0 U S D .
The j ud g e think s that the man went over b o ar d and g if t s - claim ing was without me ri t so he re pe al ed his f il ing .
If I had claim ed the who le g if t s I sen t to the girl I had a c r us h on , I would have an i p h on e 4 p l us P S 3 now .
No t only did they c ut the ti e but also had re t al i ation against each other .
There ' s nothing more ir on ic than it !
I had work ed for an A m er ic an comp an y for 4 year s before I left work d u e to ma ter n ity .
No w I ' m a home m a k er conc ent r at ing on ra is ing my d aught er in a to t ally do m est ic en v ir on ment ( which is pretty f un ) , but as days go by my English s k i ll is o b v i ous ly de c l in ing . . .
Why people s te p on me ?
Why the other str a w s are so close to me ?
Why the we a ther and w in d hu r t me ?
It is pai n ful , I ha te everything .
One str a w close to me , as k ing me why I ' m so un ha p p y .
I said , `` Why the world is so u g ly ?
This de c is ion seemed not to ex is t in my head a f e w month s a g o , because ho op was tru ly my life .
O f course , still now , I l o ve play ing B as ke t b a ll , but it ' s not my who le life , I feel .
Well , just now , I ' d like to have some re st s .
B y the way , unti l yesterday , I had never take n the T O E I C ex a m .
So I was not sure that how many people there were , and how difficult the act u al ex a m was , I had take n the p re - t est before though .
A fact , it was difficult for me , but I seemed to enjoy this sit u ation .
I heard that our d aught er was s c ar ed at first , but once she g l im p se their perform ance , she was get ting to be interest ed in it .
A l th ough I c a n ' t have a ch ance to talk to her since then , I can im a g in e her talk .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to talk to her .
I ' m going on a bu s .
But at the moment I tri ed to bu y some f r u it s and ve g e t able s , I found my b a g had go ne .
That was my second time .
I have to be care ful not to do the th ir d mi s s again .
I de c id e to write us e English .
I will transfer from my un ive r s ity to a other un ive r s ity .
I am not sure I can make full us e of a v o c a b ul ar y with sen t ence .
I think I should try write something .
n u ance is so difficult .
J a p an e se is more easy than E g l ish . .
yesterday I le ar n about C + + at my un ive r s ity .
it is too difficult to me .
I near ly could n ' t return home yesterday .
I stay ed a le c ture room from morning ti l night .
it was night m ar e .
we me t to g e ther and we went to have l un ch at the s y d ne y c ent r al p la z a .
A fter we finish ed l un ch we at e ic e c re a m .
we ar ri v ed the co le s and we b ough t a bo t t le of so f t dr in k .
we watch ed the mo v i e which was ' The To y S t or y 3 ' eat ing some s n a c k s .
A fter the mo v i e end we took a n a p for a while we talk ed to each other about my conc er n s .
My girl f ri en d have been w or ri ed about me because she may l o ve me .
I de c id ed my mind to go back to K or e a soon .
I should have le ar n ed e ng l ish and about A ust r al i a .
If I had good e ng l ish s k i ll I would get a job .
I will im p ro ve my e ng l ish s k i ll .
I want ed to see my girl f ri en d so , I called her and we hung out for a while at that time one of my f la tm ate came home with some s us h i ro ll s we f l ock ed to the t able we star ed to eat it .
As soon as we finish ed eat ting my girl f ri en d and I left at the living ro o m and str e t ch ed to g e ther .
We are get ting b or ed , tired so we going to go to be d at 1 O ' clock .
In face b ook , I make a new friend to day .
P le a se tea ch me that ' s mean ing !
I am surprise d to get such a l ot of things free of charge .
I ' m going to make a 2 j o ur n al this week en d to make up for having b ro k en my pro m is e that I ' m going to keep a di ar y every day .
because my friend is went out the ho p s it al .
my question s which I c a n ' t as k people now that such a long time has pass ed since I started study ing e ng l ish .
I ' ve never thought how poor my e ng l ish is .
It ' s great s um m er va c ation for me .
A fter 2 - week va c ation in Tokyo I came back to my a p ar t ment house in A m er ic a .
A J a p an e se woman who live s in the room just under my room came up to gr e e t me .
W o man ; We l c ome back !
I have a good new s and a bad new s for you !
M o m o k o : Well , let me he ar the good new s first .
And what ' s the bad new s . . .
W o man : It ' s a long , my s ter i ous story . . .
W o man : While you were away , I re al i z ed pe c ul i ar sound in the k it ch en d ur ing the night .
M o m o k o : P o l ter g e is t !
One night I heard the sound in the c a b in e t under the s in k .
I put my e ar on the do or of the c a b in e t and listen ed .
It sound ed like something was s c r at ch ing the b a g con tain ing ri ce .
W o man : No !
I bang ed on the c a b in e t do or , ho p ing that the s c r at ch ing sound would stop . . .
and it stop p ed .
W o man : Yes , and . . .
there were a f e w s c r at ch es and b ite s on the th ic k paper b a g of ri ce .
I show ed the b a g to the a p ar t ment own er and . . .
W o man ; He hand ed me this . . .
What sh o ud I do if a ra t , mi st a k ing ly eat ing the po is on and s u f f er ing , j um p s from the k it ch en c a b in e t ?
What should I d if I find a de ad ra t in the c a b in e t ?
The da i ly `` In ter ne t s la ng in J a p an `` change for `` K in d police office r `` to day .
( the in qu ir y did in police office and un ive r s ity .
I want ed ri d e in a p at ro l c ar !
I do not like ra in ing because . . .
I can not we ar n ic e c l o th es and sh o es and cause we t my ha ir .
A l th ough I know only one good point . .
I can ex c us e not go to the g y m because of ra in ; )
H a ve a great day with smile to every on e
To day is the day that J a p an e se s u f f er ed from N u c le ar we a p on in H i ro s h im a 6 5 year s a g o .
The ce re m on y about mo ur n ing the p op le who were di ed in this we a p on has been he l d every year , but in this year it is so his t or ical because the re p re s ent at ive s from we s ter n co un t or ies part ic i p at ed in this ce re m on y , es pe c i a ly United States .
This change is d u e to the sp e a ch by P re s id ent O b a m a in B er l in .
And what I was most impress ed is that the ce c re ta ry g en er al M r .
B an K i - mo on made some sp e a ch st or on g ly about a ne ce s s ar y of st or on g will to the a ch i e ve ment of world pe a ce without N u c le ar we a p on .
I think he may have some mi x ed feel ing s because many J a p an e se made c r u el act ing s and be ha v i or to people in the K or e an P en in s ul a , and he might be b la m ed by some K or e an who do n ' t like J a p an e se .
But he visit ed and made some sp e a ch es in j a p an over the se feel ing s and back g r ound .
W h i ch way is better to ti p wait er and wait re s s ?
I ' m not sure how to ti p at re st a ul ant because I ' ve just mo v ed in A m er ic a and my mother country J a p an does n ' t have such a c ust o m .
D o you think which way is better ?
1 : I pay the b i ll and ti p in c ash .
2 : I pay the b i ll in de b it and ti p in c ash .
3 : I pay the b i ll and ti p in de b it .
I always do 1 or 2 way s .
If I do 3 , sh ul d I write an am o un t of ti p down in b i ll ?
I would be ha p p y if you c or re c t my English comp o s i tion us e your n at ive express ion : - )
I wish I am as s m ar t as a g en i us , A l b er t E in s te in .
I have back ed to my home t ow n from H i ro s h im a to day by a ir p la ne .
I s it near - mi s s ?
A n y way , I was very surprise d that .
H a ve you same ex pe ri ence ?
R e c ent ly I w i i take an e ng l ish ex a m .

D o n ' t laugh at me , please .
The se days I have a l ow spirit s .
She said I always go out to play with my bo y friend every day .
But the fact is I did ' t go out every day .
The co ll e g e entrance ex a m in ation have go ne , we need re la x ing .
I gradua ted from my j un o ir co ll e g e on M ar ch 1 5 th .
I went to j un i or co ll e g e so my school life was for 2 year s .
I felt very f a st to pass the time ! !
If possible I want to go there again !
S in ce I was j un i or high school .

To day I went to S ant a M on ic a to bu y so f a .
I b ough t a so f a made by b r ow n le a ther .
R e c ent ly , there are something I consider .
Why does people say s w e ar w or d of ten .
I think they do n ' t not ic e the w or d they s ad will hu r t some on e im p or t ant some time .
They do n ' t know how much it pai n some on e .
I do n ' t want to say any w or d s which I do n ' t want to he ar for any on e .
E ver y on e need s kind mind and should take care to every on e around you .
I am spoke n to by my bo s s and she always say some w or d which make s me s ad and n er v ous to me l ate ly .
L i ke , `` you are already too old , take care of co l d `` `` I do n ' t have any idea that you can not get any bo y f ri en d `` `` o h you got some we i g h t ! !
Even though She is 9 old er than me , she also does n ' t have any bo y f ri en d , She has more we i g h t than me , and She talk that just in front of our c ust ome r ! !
I am keep ing my p at i ence all the time but I feel so tired d ur ing work ing .

I was so ex cited that I did not c he c k the s i z es very well and I end ed up bu y ing 3 different s i z es .
To day , I pai n t a in u k ash i , it is a character of no ve l , N O . 6 in the morning .
My friend te le p h on ed me to k i ll time .
I some time dis like her , because she s c o l d me for not f o ll w ing what I say s .
A l s o , I only can s a ve very small am o un t of e le c t ri c ity , so I feel help less ness .
It ' s very t ough for me to think about anything in such a m u g g y we a ther . . .
It is da ng er ous to in ve st all money at once , there f or e I di v id e my money and sp en d a small am o un t of money on them .

I have de c id ed to po st voice j o ur n al s here , because there is only so many op po t un it ies to speak English in my usual life .
Some time s , I talk to him on the in ter ne t , but he st ud ies J a p an e se hard so I always end up speak ing in J a p an e se as I talk to him .
I have po st ed some v id e o b l o g s that I spoke in English on You T u b e before .
But , I could not po st a l ot , because there was nothing to tell es pe c i ally when I would try to po st something every time .
But , L an g - 8 is different from You T u b e , because people can c or re c t my English I w ro te .
I a p p re c i ate those c or re ction s so far by you all , and than k you for listen ing to this j o ur n al .

Let ' s wait and see . ' But the things did n ' t change at all .
A fter she had an X - ra y , they found the cause of the st o m a ch a ch es .
( S or ry this is not a beautiful story ! ) They p re s c ri b ed some me d ic in e for her , and things has been get ting better .
This is just an as id e .
I ' m now p re p ar ing for the entrance ex a m of the gradua te school .
B y the end of this J un e , I ' ve been work ing as a b an k er .
But I qu it it and de c id ed to ent er the gradua te course .
I do n ' t have any re g re t against what I de c id ed to do .
But I ' m very an x i ous about whether I can get a new job after I ' ll leave there .
It ' s because new under g r ad u ate s have more ch ance s to be hu n ted by J a p an e se comp an ies .
A long time a g o , when I le ar n the s w im m ing in the s w im m ing po o l ,
S in ce I was a very you ng ch il d , I us ed to s w im at the sha ll ow la ne .
U ne x pe c t ly , I was f al led into de e p la ne that it was us ed only a d ul t .
I str u g g led to get out de e p water and I end ed up es c a p ing the water .
A fter I was almost dr ow n ed ,
I have been s c ar y about de e p water , s w im m ing , po o l .
But re c ent ly , I have been le ar n ed a s w im m ing in the s w im m ing po o l .
If every body cha ll e ng ed against own f e ar , it could over c ome the f e ar .
I do n ' t know who will read this , but I ' ll keep it as of ten as possible .
I ' m work ing the night sh if t watch ing the O ly m p ic s now .
I ' ve been always watch ing it on T V since It started .
I did n ' t think it ' d for ce me to stay up l ate this time at first , because there is only 1 h o ur time di f f er ence between C h in a and J a p an .
O ur house is 9 5 0 square feet , so it is small c ut e w h ite house .
Yes ter day , 2 pai r of co up le s came over and saw our house , and we got some respon se but we did n ' t get off er yet .
To m or r ow some on e is coming here , also it is going to having a open house on this S un day .
I ho pe we could get a good off er soon .
I am little a b it tired l ate ly .
W ri te s first time .
F u ture , I want to write about my impress ion s of watch ing an im e .
And do you have a favor ite s ing er ?
I ' m interest in r ock m us ic now .
A c t u ally I had n ' t been able to sleep well l ate ly ( I do n ' t know why . . .
may b e it ' s because of w or d c up ? ? ) , any way I was stay ed up unti l after mi d night .
It ' s kind of an no y ing , and of course I co un ted she e p but did n ' t work .
Then I just turn d on f an , took a time and re la x ed . . .
then next moment , I was w o k en up by s un s h in e .
I just re al i z e it was 1 0 a m and I would be l ate .
In J a p an , after having gradua ted from a co ll e g e , most of j a p an se se students work im m ed i at ly , then , stay in the comp an y at least for 3 to 5 year s .
Even t u ally most j a p an e se fresh - gradua ted e m p l o y e es w in d up stay ing there for co up le of year s even if they have los t the interest of work ing in that comp an y .
In fact , I had work ed there for s ever al year s , however I ra re ly saw people who work ed for more than 2 year s .
I had about 2 0 s ta f f ( sub or d in ate s ? ) under my position .
but only 1 or 2 person s had re m a in ed for 2 year s in the comp an y , the re st just left there with in 1 year .
I did work out with my friend to day .
and then I watch ed s up er b a ll ! !
at that time , It stay ed my friend , her bo y f ri en d , bo y f ri en d ' s friend s and I .
I could n ' t speak with every on e but I think It was re ally good ex pe ri ence for me .
I w an n a do my be st before go back to J a p an !
To day , my class m ate s ga ve me the p l um s from his y ar d .
He is a tri ling u al .
He asked me that why I had n ' t at ten d ed class on last We d ne s day .
He said If I d ar ed to eat f at me at .
My answer was `` Y A P `` and then he dr o ve me to a V i e t n ame se gr o ce ry .
While I took around in the V i e t an m e se mo m - and - p op st or e , he pe t ted my should er and said , `` He re you go , a V i e t n ame se s and w h i ch . ``
In the re ce s s to day , he still p ul led me to the corner again and asked me if I want ed the p ul m s and ve g e t able s .
He know s that I u a u ally c ook ed on my own to s a ve money .
A t the mo n ent , I almost b ur st ed into tea r s .
It is sure that my T O E I C s c or e is very r ow .
However I like to watch some English mo v i e and talk to English man ,
What should I do to gr ow my English s k i ll s ?
And I read some b ook s in English e ve y - day .
I know I need make an effort .
R e c ent ly , a J a p an e se comp an y declar e off ic i al language is English .
They should us e English e ve y s ity ation .
If I am in the e m p l o y of this comp an y , should I hand in my resign a - tion ?
This sen t ence explain s my me d ical work .
The reason why we se le c ted pro st ate can c er s amp le s from ra d ical pro st ate c t o m y is that between 1 997 and 2 0 0 4 at our ho s p it al the 4 8 . 5 % ( 99 / 2 0 5 ) of s ur g er y were perform ed follow ing ne o - a j u v ant ho r m on al the r a p y .
R e c ent ly , M o st s ur g er y are perform ed without ne o - a j u v ant ho r m on al the r a p y at our ho s p it al .
There f or e , the an a ly se s of s amp le in ra d ical pro st ate c t o m y without ne o - a j u v ant ho r m on al the r a p y are c ur r ent ly on g o ing .
It took for 9 0 minute s .
It was hard a b it but I enjoy ed it .
I think I have a good b al ance because I try ed s ur f ing some time s .
We s w e at ed all over ! !
I l o ve to s w e at by sp or t s .
To night I saw the f il m ver s ion of `` The P h ant o m of O p er a `` at home , which is play ed on T V for almost three hour s ! ! !
But it s m us ic is re ally f ant a st ic , the le ad ing act re s s ' voice de e p ly appeal ed to me .
The ir beautiful voice have impress ed me a l ot , sure ly like a ha un ting me l o d y in my mind .
I was tru ly to u ch ed by the sen t i ment al mo v i e , es pe c i ally when the p h ant o m let C h ri st in e and R a o ul go , I can not help but she d my tea r s .
I sympath i z e with the p h ant o m a l ot though he is some time s too c r u el , but I think it ' s the so c i e ty that made him c r a z y .
How so l it ud e he was ! ! !
It ' s a p ity that he can not b r ing his t al ent into full play .
He is a g en i us !
Well , since I will go to N Y this s um m er va c ation , I expect to go to B ro ad way for watch ing this show on the scene .
I got the new one .
To night , I am pai n ting .
I ' ve already do my job .
I was re ally ex cited , because I was no idea how should I get the new one .
But now , I am pai n ting my new ar t work .
I am think ing around the sp a ce .
This sp a ce is full of p ow er , because every on e can see but other s not just we can see .
What should I write on in t ro d u ction of my co m m un ity ?
by the way , the str ing b ro ke down ( ? ? ) : (
I have to go for change the str ing . . .
I sign ed up yesterday , this is my first di ar y
I am so glad to find this we b s ite to le ar n e ng l ish .
he he , I wish I can make more and more friend s around the world .
M o st of our g en er ation are the one - ch il d .
I am a G e m in i , and my b l o o d ty pe is B .
But now I need to us e my e ng l ish for my business , it make s me do more ex er c is es to im p ro ve it every day .
T h an k s a l ot
The P h i ll ies W in s !
A t first , I did n ' t want to watch the game because of my study .
The P h i ll ies led most of the game , so I was n ' t w or ri ed very much and strong ly believe d they w on .
However , in the e i g h th in n ing , the sit u ation change d .
I found the R ock ies led .
In the n in th in n ing , R y an How ar d hi t and the s c or e 4 - 4 .
The s c or e even t u ally turn ed 5 - 4 in the to p of n in th .
I c a n ' t take my eyes off the P o st se as on .
H a ll ow e e m part y
yesterday , I went to H a ll ow e en part y of school .
And I thought one thing , it is that how different b it w e en j a p an e se and other s .
When I went to part y , every on e made up and w or e co st um e that is D r a c ul a , Z o m b i and V amp i re .
it was so funny and am a z ing because I ' ve never see n like this part y when I stay ed J a p an .
Then , we were da n c ing in a room .
but most J a p an e se could n ' t do .
I know why , normal y we could n ' t have op p or t un ity that we do da n c ing in J a p an .
And one more reason is our person al ity , g en er ally J a p an e se is sh y , quiet and un c on f id ent , it ' s only my op in i p n .
E s pe s i a ly , we are quite un c on f id ent , p es s im is t ic and ne g at ive .
I think the se are one of person a ity pro ble m and it cause that we are afraid f a il ur e .
A c t u ally it di p en d s on person .
I mean J a p an e se need to have con f id ent and co ur age .
I believe that this is interest ing for some on e who are le an ing J a p an e se because I will comp ar e the life in U S with that in J a p an .
E ver y p rofessor s has a big p ri or ity to their course s and they try to im p ro ve the qu al ity of their class es .
On the other hand , J a p an e se un ive r s ity provide s more op p or t un it ies for re se ar ch .
This di f f er ence cause s by the way to e v al u ate un ive r s ity .
And , the se ra n k ing s are consider ed as very im p or t ant is s u es .
In turn , there is less ra n k ing about un ive r s it ies in J a p an .
I f in ally not ic ed work ing as a day la b or er does n ' t s u it me .
If I work little by little after school week day s , I can co pe with study ing and part time job .
Even though I ' ve work ed as a day la b or er for two year s , I ' m through do ing !
( I ' ve just not ic ed this ent ry is full of a bad mo o d .
I ' m sorry if this ent ry make s you un p le as ant . )
My f a v o ur ite f o o d s are ic e c re a m , p ud d ing , ch o c o l ate , c a ke , y o g ur t , s ash im i , s us h i , t empura , gra t in , and so on .
To day I change d my ha ir co l or because my b r ow n ha ir is so bad and my ha ir is so da m age d : ( I di c id ed to change d my ha ir co l or ! !
And I try to gr ow up my ha ir by long .
When my ha ir will c ur e , I d y e them again .
I are f a m il i ar with it s ha ir co l or .
B e c a us e black ha ir was a g o ent er ing U n ive r s ity .
But I do n ' t like black ha ir because I think the black ha ir is so dark and the face does n ' t look like he al th y .
I change d the to p ic .
It was so n ic e time .
R e c ent ly my work is bu s y so I could n ' t study hard because I do n ' t have a free time . . .
but I want to keep writing j o ur n al ! !
I think this work is good re s ul t one day .
T e a ch er : O K , would you please see the se two she e t s ?
One is your so n ' s , and the other is the one of the st ud ent sit ting next .
F a ther : So what ?
D o you j ud g e that my so n c he at ed because both of them w ro te the right answer ?
Q u es tion 2 , `` Where was the p or t that the B l an c k S h i p s ( called the ' K ur o f un e ' in J a p an e se .
They were the first mission from U S and sh ock ed J a p an e se people at the time po l it ic ally and c ul t ur ally . ) called at ? `` .
There are many , many p or t s in J a p an .
And my so n and the st ud ent might happen to write the same wrong answer .
My so n w ro te the right answer , and the st ud ent c he at ed .
I live in we st - j a p an where not affect ed after m a th of e ar th qu a ke dis aster .
What will happen to my life and where j a p an will go ?
No r m al life is p ri ce less , I found after things happen ed .
But , I think , now , It is time to make a effect to sp en d life as usual as possible .
To the con t r ar y , what I can do is c ar ry ing out my respon s i b il ity for around me , family , co m m un ity , to be able to sp en d their life each other .
F or j a p an , for me , for my ch il d re n ' s g en er ation .
To day is a beautiful day is n ' t it .

Some day , I want to talk with my friend in S p an ish and I ho pe to be going good at them soon er .

I sp en d so much time to do this things .
I am almost str es s ed out with English and some stuff .
P e op le enjoy a kind of part y on that boat .
U s u ally , at the boat , people eat s as im i or something tra d i tion al j a p an e se ex p en s ive f o o d s .
But in that course , we can eat only c he a p er f o o d ; J a p an e se p an c a ke s [ o k on o m i _ y a k i ] .
But , we enjoy ed at m o s p he re s u f f ic i ent ly .
If we will become a ri ch girl s , we try to a u th ent ic Ya k at a _ B un e .
I did n ' t know what G en pe t s are unti l yesterday , when one of my friend s in the English course had an ex t r a present ation - - a punishment for let ting her mo b i le r ing d ur ing the course - - and this present ation was about G en pe t s .
C o l or co d ing is what de ter m in es the ty pe of the person al ity , such that ;
G en pe t Red : A th l etic and en er g etic
There life sp an is 2 to 3 year s .
So the question is : What do you think of the idea of the se G en pe t s ?
and would you like to p ur ch a se one of them ?
I am tak ing a pro f ound interest in work er s in As i a .
As i a has a ex pe ri ence to be co l on i z ed by E ur o pe an I m pe ri al is t s for a long time .
K or e a was a co l on y of J a p an for 3 5 year s , too .
D ur ing co l on i z ation , not only in v ad er s de st ro y ed n ation al tra it s and the c ul ture but also over ex p l o it ed people ' s la b or .
Besides that , As i a co un t ri es were de p ri v ed from op p or t un it ies of mo d er n i z ation by in v ad er s .
F ur ther m or e people are still s u f f er ing from po l it ical c or r up tion , po la ri z ation of we al th , wide s p re ad po ver ty .
I ' d like to work for work er s and w ome n who have a hard time in As i a .
I am sure that ex pe ri ence s of So u th K or e a will help them since K or e a went through co l on i z ation , mi l it ar y di c t at or s h i p , po la ri z ation of we al th , po l it ical c or r up tion e t c .
A n y way , let me finish my w or d saying my re al dr e a m .
I am sorry that I re p l i ed your commen t s l ate and I did not write my di ar y every day .
I will go back to O h i o 1 0 th A p ri l .
L ate ly , a pro ble m appeared .
M ate ri al s of da i ly ent ri es are out of st ock !
I have always looked around something interest ing for this sit e , and co ll e c ted incident s that of ten happen to us .
I want ed to find di f f er ence s of feel ing s among co un t ri es .
I c a n ' t re al i z e such ma ter i al s for ent ri es any long er .
I have n ' t came a cross this s l um p for that long time .
But it is only on the s ur f a ce and some people have bad ha b it s in their job and their re l ation s h i p s in in ter i or ly .
They always p re ten d fine person s but some people know their di r ty mind .
I also ha te them because they are always do ing in j ust ic e .
We are always got ten a ng ry from them .
I want to that they will leave as soon as possible .
It is n ation al ho l i day in J a p an .
I think that sp en d watch the mo v ies or play ten n is on me .
I ' m get ting us ed to the we a ther here , but the thing I c a n ' t still get us ed to is the time while the s un ri se s in s um m er .
It could ri se from 5 a m to 9 p m .
It ' s a little strange for me , it ' s not dark d ur ing the supper time , and also we can eat dinner outside ! !
I ' m c r a z y about for it .
It ' s been long time to visit here .
H i , all of my friend s who me e t here .
I have trouble s with me and my room m ate .
R e c ent ly , I ' ve felt something wrong to be with my life day by day .
In the tru th , I feel con f us ed with my dr e a m what to do .
I ' ve got b ur d en s on my should er s .
F or me , I dr e ame d to become a so c i al we l f ar e not that long a g o ,
I think and think and think , what to do in the future .
But on the s ad e ly , still I c a n ' t str id e through o ut what I go n n a do for my ha p p in es .
He l o ve s and a d d ic t to ex er c is e at the he al th c l u b and there f or e , he ' s been the front of his la p t op at his desk .
He want to have a c a ke and eat it too all the time s .
That ' s way he ' s always have a me al be y ound mi d night and talk me eat to g e ther .
H is go b ble ' s sound make s me not to sleep e ar ly and get c r a z i ly .
How should I tell him about my difficult y .
I ' m on the th ir d gra d e in middle school .
So , I and my class m ate s had to c le an our class ro o m and dress our un if or m s ne at ly .
K or e an school s have quite str ic t r ul es about co st um e and ha ir .
F or t un ate ly , I was n ' t point ed out my co st um e . ( If so , we would get bad point . )
I ho pe that K or e an school s are more free like f o e i g n school s .
It is D a y off to day
I st u day ed English from 7 to 9 in this mo r n n ing .
I start to study since last J an u ar y .
I am try ing to write us ing re c ent ly le ar n ed express ion s .
It is help ful to re m e m b er express ion s .
F or the most part , all of them see m as if they are not c or re c t ow ing to lack ing in p r a c t ic es .
If you have enough try ing , your command of a for e i g n language you le ar n will be g u ar ant e ed high le ve l .
A t least I expect so .
F or a f or e ment ion ed a p p ro a ch I re c o m m en d you make in d e x c ar d s as a v o c a b ul ar y l is t .
When you le ar n something new , write down on a c ar d .
And then , writing a di ar y with your second language , p ic k up some c ar d from the de c k to a p p ly new one to your try ing .
How about my me th o d of le ar n ing a new sen t ence ?
D o n ' t he s it ate about start ing .
And , B e p at i ent with the time need ed to b r us h your s k i ll up .
A h , One more thing .
I almost for g e t to say this , by far the most im p or t ant ti p .
With all me n tion ed way s , the most sign if ic ant hi n t is re m a in ed .
The hi n t is you need L an g - 8 friend s help ing with their n at ive to n gue but also your for e i g n language .

D o n ' t know how to sp en d my time ! !
To day , I took pai d va c ation .
B e c a us e , ty p h o on came to J a p an on to day .
But , ty p h o on pass ed J a p an e ar ly morning .
So , I was le is ur e .
And I go to a l i b r ar y .
I b or r ow the no ve l `` G re en mi le `` w it ten by S te p h en E d w in K ing .
I do n ' t know I will finish read ing this no ve l .
But , I try to read ing !
There was something happen ed in my house , I just feel not co m f or t able .
What ever my room ate s and I will so l ve that .
This time I know the person that who can be friend or just have di at ance .
I he l d a w ed d ing ce re m on y about 1 m on th a g o .
M an y friend s and re l at ive s came our w ed d ing ce re m on y .
I told my p ar ent and my w if e to than k s .
so I thought the w ed d ing ce re m on y became sp e c i al .
And I never for g e t that sp e c i al day .
O ur co up le is ha p p y !
I ' m sorry about it .
The J a p an e se is b as ic ally mo d est .
B e c a us e J a p an e se sign if y respect other part y .
And J a p an e se were a g ri c ul t ur al people an c i ent time s ,
J a p an e se had been gr ow n by nature .
It gr ow ed j a p an e se spirit that respect ed nature .
This is the first di ar y for me .
B y the way , what are you go n n a do at the sp r ing va c ation ?
Well , I ' m go n n a go to T a i w an at the sp r ing va c ation .
My brother stay ing to make a business tri p in T a i w an for three month s .
So I ' m go n n a go to T a i w an by us ing the per i o d .
O f course , I ' m go n n a stay at the my brother ' s house .
I ' m study ing C h in e se a little now ' c a us e it ' s a sp r ing va c ation soon .
My e m o tion
I think I am a c al m person but when I e ng age d in hard talk with my friend , I los t my ability to con t ro l my feel ing s and could n ' t say anything and felt my mind and think ing were stop p ed from work ing .
I know I can express about my feel ing with a good manner if I was c al m but what I can do with my e m o tion s .
I try to comp o se the so ng s with English ly ri c s and if my mistake s are c or re c ted I ' ll great ly a p p re c i ate .

W h o se just if ic ation will help you not to feel l on e ,
With o ut f e ar of future
I ' ll s te p in open ed do or
so , to day I ' ll in t ro d u ce myself .
My home town is very small and s ur r ound ed mo un tain s which is l o c at ed in c ent er of J a p an .
I gr ow n up see ing the J a p an e se A l p s in the dis t ance from my house .
I live d with my p ar ent s , el d er s is ter who is mar ri ed and gr ow ing up her so n and d aught er with her has b and .
we have one very c ut e w h ite c at .
On week en d , I enjoy c ook ing , s w im m ing in the po o l , p r a c t ic ing Y o g a in my room , read ing b ook s .
and I ' m le ar n ing j a p an e se tea ce le m on y once in a week .
I ' m interest ed in j a p an e se tra d i tion al c ul ture , such as tea ce le m on y , k im on o , j a p an e se f l ow er ar r an g e ment .
No w a day s the se are something we pay money to le ar n for many j a p an e se .
Some people we ar k im on o of ten or every day ( ex amp le , who are o b se s s ed in j a p an e se c ul ture , who le ar n / tea ch tea ce le m on e y , j a p an e se manner and j a p an e se f l ow er ar r an g e ment s . . .
T h ough , many j a p an e se do n ' t own their K im on o , r ent and take s er v ic e to be w or e K im on o when we need .
We do n ' t do tea ce le m on y in da i ly life ex c ept when our f a m il ies or our s el ve s are f a m i ll i er with it .
The reason why I ' m interest ed in j a p an e se c ul ture is that we need to have s k i ll s well b al ance d in many j an le s .
And , we become e age r to le ar n every j an le e qu ally .
when I le ar n tea ce le m on e y , we became e age r to le ar n good hand w ri ting , language s , be ha v i o ur , f l ow er ar r an g e ment .
w he I le ar n mar t i al ar t s , I became e age r to le ar n be ha v i o ur .
It ' s not ne ce s s ar y to the se le ve le s are ex ce ll ent .
the im p or t ant is that we have s k i ll s e qu ally in many j an le .
as a begin e er , you need to have every s k il le s at begin n er ' s le ve l .
if you go in ter m id i ate in one j an le , you need to have s k i ll s which is better than begin n er s also in other j an le .
I think J a p an e se tra d i tion al c ul ture has en o m ous things more than we can le ar n and understand through who le our life .
I will try writing about the se things I le ar n d .
As an E ng in e er , I ' m interest ed in me d ical and te ch no l o g y .
I ho pe I can make friend s who have interest ed in the se to p ic s , and p r a c t ic e talk ing and dis c us s ing in English .
T h an k you for read ing long in t ro d u ction written in poor English .
D e c 1 0 th : She r k 3
I had see n ' She r k 3 ' on T V to night .
It was the first time to see the mo v i e .
I was little tired because it was so bu s y .
I at e an pe ar s and dr in k something hot .
H m m , I ' m f al ling sleep .
R e c ent ly , I b ough t a i P o d To u ch . because , that way English study ' s more interest ing .
In fact , This is very us e ful l and co o l de s i g n .
But , One pro ble m is the b at ter y has de c re as ed in an in st ant .
by the way , I like watch ing j a p an e se an im ation mo v ies .
this ent ry is about what I talk ed about with my friend to day :
what should I do while I am a co ll age st ud ent ( in other w or d s , before I gradua te and work ) . . . ?
I did an in ter n s h i p in J a p an for 6 month s and it was k il ling me .
I was like this : I work ed from 8 a m to 1 0 p m 6 day s a week , and I s l ept a who le day on S un because I usual ly did n t sleep enough and felt so sleep y every day .
then M on came and I work ed so hard for such a long time on M on to S at . . .
I serious ly did n t have any time and en er g y for in ve st ing in myself in the future .
im c r a z y about b ook s and usual ly read every day b as ic ally F O R F U N .
B U T I even could n t do that d ur ing the per i o d .
how the he ll could I study something that will be need ed for myself in the future ?
we , students , don t have money .
but we have p l ent y of time .
of course I have to say students are also bu s y with study , part time job or what ever .
but comp ar ed to people work ing , we are a b s o l ut e ly so free .
so what I w an n a do in a co ll e g e is something which I have to sp en d so much time to a c qu i re it .
so far I came up with 3 things .
serious ly I think that if I study the se things before I gradua te and p re p ar e myself for the future , my life will change in a good way .
id like to explain more de ta il s about those 3 things but now I have to study for the ex a m which will be the most difficult ever ( in fact , it s k il ling me ! ! !
I have so many things to do ) .
My U . K . ' s me m or y
My st o m a ch a ch e just came from why the f o o d were not s u it able for me after all , I could n ' t enjoy the tra ve l .
I ' ll never for g e t that tra ve l .
But she has lie d down on the so f a .
And she had tea r s on her eyes .
No w she is sleep ing on the so f a too .
I went to Ya k in i ku with 1 0 people who are from U .
We first ly try to talk as a w k w ar d in English .
And then , We start dr in k ing and eat ing as much as we like s .
We dr in k a l ot of gra s s of the be er , because they hold their l i qu or well .
There of ten be two be er m u g on the t able each person .
The s w e ad ish man said ' ' Ka m p a i ' ' each f if te en m un it s .
The most surprise d one in that day was dr in k ing J a p an e se S a ke .
They have dr un k co l d S a ke before , they said the ta s te was not good .
So , I c he c k ed them to who want s to dr in k with me , but no body want s .
This time I or d er ed a w ar m s a ke bo t t le with two s a ke c up s , and I will dr in k s l ow ly un ti ll we leave .
I po ur ed my c up and another one for they can try to ta s te w ar m one .
We dr in k it , then , N ic k said ' ' it s ta s te good ' ' .
Then , he started to po ur ed S a ke for e v ry in ter n ation al students he ga ve one by one .
J ust take d 5 m un it s , the S a ke bo t t le was e m p ty .
I was in d um p surprise d , because they dr in k ed S a ke at once po ur ed by po ur ed .
And then I re al i z ed that was last or d er .
So , J a p an e se should tell do not dr in k like dr in k ing the te qu il a to for e i g n er s before st at s to dr in k the S a ke .
If you for g e t this , you will see the only e m p ty bo t t le in a short time .
I ' ve got a reason why she stop ed a cha t s ud d en ly .
She ga ve me a me s s age .
I attempt ed to write di ar y unti l to day but I did n ' t make it because I was very bu s y .
To day , however , I de c id ed to write di ar y again .
No w , I study English hard er in or d er to make the T O E F L s c or e .
but my writing and speak ing s k i ll s is not to good .
So I try to us e this too l again .
L e ar n ing English give s me not easy , because I original ly st ud i ed G er man .
No w I have finish ed gra d e 9 .
F in ish ing school , I ' m not in R us s i a , and in I re l and .
There f or e I need to de e p en their know led g e of English .
I went to the be a ch to s ur f ing yesterday .
A l th ough the w a ve were s a m ll , there was a l ot of s ur f er in the sea .
The w a ve were small er than previous be a ch and there is a f e w s ur f er .
So I de c id ed to do s ur f ing at this be a ch .
S e a is co l d a little .
On the way back from the be a ch to my house , I at e the ra m en .
I always want ed some body to c or re c t my English sen t ence s . . .
I want me to speak and write English more natural ly . . .
I read a new s which said that there are many A m er ic an s who like to us e this so c i al ne t w or k , and that some on e even took days off just to play it at home .
I also found that t w it ter is get ting p op ul ar in E ur o pe and A m er ic a , and here in T a i w an many te ch - g e e k s us e p l ur k more .
D u e to the F a ce b ook has C h in e se ver s ion , I sp en d some time re g is ter ing it .
It is not what I though it would be , I original ly though it was suppose d to be a B l o g in ter f a ce or something like that .
To keep up with the te ch no l o g y is very im p or t ant , something new to this er a may be out - of - d ate in the up c o m ing future .

When you write f an letter s , what do you think which is better ?
I also want to as k you when I write , which kind of things do I pay more at ten tion ?
If you know about them , please tea ch me .

The se days I have been s up er bu s y and that ' s why I have n ' t been able to w ri g h t my j o ur n al ent ry . . . ; (
P le a se c or re c t a letter be l ow .
I ' m going on a tri p in M a y and I am str u g g ling with b ook ing a ir p la in ti c ke t s and hotel s .
I b ook ed by p h on e and they asked me to sen d them e - ma il s to con f ir m my name , our a ir p la in s ch ed ul e and so on because of know ing our c he c k - in .
This is one of them I want to sen d them .
T it le : O ur f ri g h t s ch ed ul e on 2 6 th M a y
D e ar M ad a m and Sir ,
This is M a m i H a k o z a k i , who called you to day , just before .
We have 2 people in all .
I would like to stay at the night of 2 6 th and 2 7 th in M a y ( 2 night and 3 days ) .
I ' ll show you our a ir p la in number and s ch ed ul e be l ow .
F light It in er ar y ;
about s m o k ing .
B e f or e I w ro te di ar y , I say some other things .
L a st night , I s ud d ent ly my e y e is very re d .
It is not good to my eyes .
I know this , but I c a n ' t con t ro l myself to us e comp ut er .
If I c a n ' t us e comp ut er a day , I will feel un c o m f or t able .
I probab ly a d d ic ted to the comp ut er just like s m o k ing .
I come to this train ing school s about 2 month s .
I think now I can speak some English to some on e else .
But last night ' s to p ic I do n ' t know how to express .
P ro b ably I am not interest ed in that to p ic or my va c u b ul ar y is not enough or my English is still very poor .
L a st night , the teacher come from A m er ic a .
he is a very hand s ome guy .
But I don ' s think he tea ch students well .
we di c us s ed s m o k ing .
the to p ic is very simple .
In d i an p ar ent s tea ch their ch il d s m o k ing , but the ch il d re n ' s least age is 2 year s old and s m o ke s ever al c i g ar e t s a day .
It is usual in In d i a .
A 2 year s old ch il d was s m o k ing .
He was so p h is t ic at ed like an a d ul t and s m o k ing 2 c i g ar e e t s at the same time .
people were laugh ing around the ch il d re n .
P ar ent s should be respon s i ble for their ch il d en , p re te c t them and g u id e them to a right direction .
I do n ' t a d m it . . .
But I do n ' t want to a d m it I am a bo t t le - man .
I found out this we b s ite a f e w days a g o , and I found it very help ful to me .
I want to im p ro ve my English and T ha i language .
T h an k u ! !
It has dr i z z led since last night .
However , a re c ent ra in y sea s on has a he a v y ra in , the thunder and the light n ing .
In ra in that f a ll s quiet ly , it c al m s down my mind .
To day I talk ed on M S N with in d e an guy who I me t through it al k i , which is in ter n ation al so c i al ne t w or k ing s er v ic e we b s ite .
It was said by him that my English pro no un c i ation is re ally good , however , I could n ' t speak much .
I ' d like to get able to speak more .
3 ) about my future p l an
A ha y f ever
It see m s that I get a ha y f ever re c ent ly .
I go back from outside , I c a n ' t stop s ne e z ing and a run n y no se .
In J a p an we eat O S E C H I .
it is the sp e c i al N e w Y e ar ' s f o o d .
R e c ent ly there are a l ot of people who bu y O S E C H I .
M an y of J a p an e se f o o d s is de l ic ate ly and take s many time .
In hu s b and ' s p ar ent s family I must make one or two me n u .
I think about it I become very n er v ous .
It is possible to in c re a se the J a p an e se f o o d in this year .
My d aught er go es an in ter n ation al school ,
I have to co m m un ic ate with her teachers and friend s , p ar ent s in English .
I ho pe my English will get better if I could con t in u e w ri t ting di ar y in English .
I ' m sorry I ' m s l ow in English .
If you can , I ' m re ally glad that you could c he c k my di a ly .
I think that this is a ter ri ble high - p a ce ! !
S is a c ar - so c i e ty , I do n ' t have to walk a l ot when n ever I go to some where .
he ll o ! !
I like read her o st or ies . . .
well I ho pe to im p ro ve my e ng l ish so in that way I can success my go al s ! ! . . .
Some time s I get a co l d after I am ex po s ed to a c r ow ed .
I take a me d ic in e just in case .
N e ed a R e fresh ing
It is week en d , I have a p l an to ha ng out with my friend .
I do n ' t want us e my week en d to study or do the home w or k any m or e .
B e c a us e I know that study too much make s me become sick and str es s ed .
A fter that we will go to the p ar k to get fresh a ir .
I have part - time job every day ex c ept M on day .
I am a ha ll stuff in a re st a ur ant .
L a st night , it was a pretty bu s y day and ha ll stuff s could n ' t work proper ly .
So , I want to consider what was the cause and ha w to p re v ent it .
There are three things I thought about .
F ir st ly , I think the ma in pro ble m s which can cause this trouble are an in s u f f ic i en c y of co m m un ic ation and state of mind .
I mean , we were too bu s y in both ment ally and p h is ic ally to take time for other s .
S e c on d ly , the s y s te m to c he c k what they or d er ed and what we serve is not e f f ic i ent .
To so l ve the se pro ble m s , I sh o ud re la x a b it .
I mean , I should n ' t be ten se at all time .
And then , try to let other s be e a se . *
The so l u tion can be the strong er bo n d among the ha ll stuff s !
* I want to write , I w an n a let them re la x rather than be ten se .
L i ke they work serious ly but have sp a ce in their mind to take time to see other s .
While I was there only for a week , I was as t ound ed by the fact that A m er ic an people are get ting big g er and big g er every time I visit there .
It ' s no wonder that P re s id ent O b a m a is having a trouble on the he al th in s ur ance po l ic y .
I ' ve heard that J a p an e se g en etic ally can not become so he a v y because we become sick before put ting too much f at .
I sat still on a p la ne for 1 2 hour s on my way home , wonder ing whether the e c on o m y class sea t s are big enough for the ch u b b y A m er ic an s and I was than k ful that I had to leave the States after one year back in high school days because I put 1 0 p ound s d ur ing my stay !
There are too much good f o o d in A m er ic a and they are very in e x p en s ive !
`` It could be bad , If G 2 0 meeting be s ch ed ul ed three or four day not two day ``
Some K or e an have c ri t ic is ed the G 2 0 meeting or g an i z er .

Yes ter day I told you I want to be friend s .

The first d ate in my life
I did not expect that was the one I watch ed for the first d ate in my life .
A fter a gradua tion ce re m on y of j un i or high school , I called at her house by us ing year b ook which told me the a d re s s .
My voice did not come out though I tri ed to say hard .
No w I watch ed it again , it was sure this mo v i e has quite high qu al ity , and it was not fault of this mo v i e but of me that we did not have another d ate .

let s talk with me ! ! ! !
I play ed k en d o in the class yesterday .
It is very tired and pai n ful , but it is very interest ing .
I began L an g - 8 yesterday . This is the dr a f t of `` A bout me `` .
S in ce I began language ex change at `` J a p an - g u id e .
co m `` this F e b r u ar y , I had very n ic e ex pe ri ence through the co m m un ic ation for teaching J a p an e se .
I have ex change d e m a il s , c or re c ted letter s written in J a p an e se , help ed as s i g n ment s for the de g re e , give n g u id ance how to le ar n hi r a g an a for the first time , e t c .
I am sure I can c or re c t J a p an e se sen t ence s you w ro te , with explain ing in e ng l ish , if you are better at English than in J a p an e se .
To day , I also in t ro d u ce J a p an e se c ul ture .
To day ' s to p ic is `` k on b in i ``
But J a p an e se con ve n i ence st or e has di f f er ence from any other country ' s con ve n i ence st or es .
In J a p an e se con ve n i ence st or e , you can bu y anything you want like a va ri e ty of f o o d s , gr o ce ry good s , ti c ke t s , st ation er ies , be ver age s and con f e ction er y .
In addition to this , you can with d r a w your s aving s , sen d your b a g g age s by de l ive ry s er v ic e .
To be honest , I ' ve not been do ing well the se days .
My heart and mind are not well - b al ance d .
So I c a n ' t catch up myself and am tak ing such mi s er able feel ing s on my friend s and family some time s . . .
D o n ' t look back it w o n ' t do any good , D o n ' t look a head you ' ll be just mi s un d er st o o d .

I want ed to us e la ng 8 when I was at work ( I mean d ur ing b re a k time . )
I ' ve been try ing to sea r ch such has h ta g s , but I could n ' t find .
I wish this has h ta g would be like di ction ar y which n at ive language - speak er s tea ch for you .
It s like a per f e c t di ction ar y .

The se day s , I ' ve been study ing very hard .
When I ' m study ing in there , I feel very co m f or t able .
To day ' s class was kind of b or ing , but I could le ar n many gra m m ar s .
M o st of k or e an s do n ' t us e ra d i at or .
B e c a us e most of k or e an s do n ' t we ar sh o es and sit on the floor of ten .
there ' s no c ar pe t but just w o o d floor .
I do n ' t w an n a over w or k and I need have much more time to us e my p ri v ate time .
I think that we c a n ' t de c id e anything if there were too many ch o ic e .
But There were hu g e different re f er ence b ook s for le ar n ing English .
He could n ' t ch o o se only one b ook because of an over w he l m ed ch o ic e .

F ir st of all , when we got to L an g - H o a L a c , our mo t or b i ke b ro ke down , so we have to look for some on e who can re p a ir .
Where as we wait ed for our mo t or b i ke to be re p a ir ed , some of my friend s an no y ed each other .
We had to wait ed 3 hour for help .
As soon as we ar ri v ed in H a T a y , my friend s de c id ed that it was too l ate to c l im b ing mo un tain so they want ed to s w im but I did n ' t .
U n l u c k i ly , we for g ot the way to go home ( because the way to go different the way came back ) .
On the way came home , L i en ( my close friend ) re al i z ed that she los t her b a g and she gue s s ed she los t it when stand ing near a strange man .
There were many things in her b a g ( her p h on e , money , watch . . ) .
I said with her I had never had a bad day before .
In the end , we came back home .
G ot very tired to day because of do ing many interest ing things like mo ul d ing can d le s and p re p ar ing for my ex a m s .
I le ar n t a l ot of n w e w or d s from f in an c i al v o c a b ul ar y .
H o pe this I ' ll do this a l ot more f aster than do ing my other s un day business .
I got serious head a c ke this morning sit ting in my c u b ic , so I took a half day off from 1 p m .
It is about C h in e se N e w Y e ar , so I re ally want to clear my p en d ing works before the ho l i day s , that way I do n ' t get too much p re s s ur e after I go back to work . . .
that may be the cause of my ho r ri ble head a ch e .
A n y way , enough of mi se ry : p
No t so many people do that the se days , I gue s s it ' s pretty much the same in C h ri st m as c ar d ?
Well , if any on e who happen s to see this ent ry , and is interest ed in get ting a C h in e se N e w Y e ar c ar d , p l s let me know : D I g u ar ant e e the c ar d is go n n a be c ut e , and C h in e se : )

F or t un ate ly , I me t a great teacher , W an y u , when I tri ed to at ten d some English class es .
And also I made some new friend s who speak English .
The only one I need is time . . . .
H o pe that I could im p ro ve f aster !

We went to re g is ter with this ic o s a h ed ro n - sha p ed f i g ur in e .

Y e a h , How much this it e m . . .
Then , he came back with a y e ll ow ed piece of paper .

Even I think it as a great to y .

If you get it up on the In ter ne t a u ction , co ll e c ter will bu y even half mi ll ion yen . ``
She is good much for ha g g ling .

However , I am still feel ing pai n .

D es i g n of the to p p age of L an g - 8 has been re ne w ed .

To keep act ive us er , S N S has to be change d con t in u ous ly .
W ish L an g - 8 will be im p ro v ed more and more .
In this morning , I went to a ho s p it al .
A r ound no on , I got back to home .
I took a n a p about two hour and went to sp or t ' s act i v ity class .
I am a little b it tired but I enjoy that class .
I just w ro te my j o ur n al about b a se b a ll last time , but try to write about sp or t s again .
L a st night , I went watch an N B A game for the first time , that was the P h il ad el p h i a 76 er s v s .
My friend got the ti c ke t from his comp an y and kind ly invite d me to go watch the game .
I have want ed to go watch the N B A since I came to the U S . , so I was re ally ex cited before ar ri v ing the st ad i um .
The game was so ex c it ing and also the sea t was am a z ing ly at a good position .

H o st told to him when you us e a ra z or , you have to go was h room .
But he said `` I went to there !
`` As soon as he would be a ng ry .
O f course ho st also a ng ry because we knew that he told a lie .
In fact he never apologize d to ho st .
We are not re al family but ho st treat me as a brother .
I always be honest ly because I living his house .
Why he had to told a lie ?
He usual ly does n ' t care about everything .
So we c a n ' t tru st to him .
A fter this happen ing ho st said to me `` when you c ook something , please c ook for him . ``
B e c a us e if he us e the st o ve he make a f i re .

In this morning also happen ed something .
He always sp re ad the water when he took a show er .
A fter that I had to c le an it because I do n ' t like me s s y .

I told to him how to c le an .
But he usual ly us e a paper .

I do n ' t want to dis c ri m in ation .
S um m er va c ation F in ish
I have s um m er va c ation for 1 1 day s .
It is too long for J a p an e se to take a va c ation .

I ' m look ing for w ar d to see n ic e people in the world ! !
What I can man tion to this to p ic is that I believe that this who le s w in e f l u p an ic is s te er ed by the me d i a to im p ro ve the e c on im ic sit u ation .
In my opinion everything what happen ed was very ar t if it i al .
It was c re at ed to im p ro ve the s al e of me d ic in e and to get a `` k ic k `` for the p h ar m a c y de ve l op ment of va c c in e .
A well as to show people the im p or t ance of va c c in ation and in d i re c t to per s u ad e people to bu y the va c c in e .
A ll over the world much more people di e because of stand ar d f l u but no one make s from this fact such a p an ic as the me d i a did in the case of s w in e f l u .
It is l o c at ed in about 3 k m from M in o S t ation .
M an y people came there though I had thought there would be f e w because of ch i ll .
And , a J a p an e se mo n ke y appeared in front of us .

So the town try to keep the tra d i tion al l and s c a pe and try to keep c re an .
It ' s very small but beautiful nature town and a l ot of re t ir ed person s .
Some J a p an e se office work er has dr e a m to live in the town because the town does n ' t has a train st ation so it ' s difficult to co m ut e to business z on e for ex amp le to Tokyo .
But I ch o se to live there with long co m ut e time , I work in S h im b ash i c ent r al of Tokyo .
The time to co m ut e is 1 h 4 0 m .

And we have l ot s of f a m ous ra m en re st a ur ant s in J a p an .

So I will call a s er v ic e c ent er of the make r tomorrow .
And I called my friend who has been my al um n us and was tax account ant .
I asked about some tax pro ble m s .
But it was difficult to explain about it on the p h on e , so I sen t e - ma il about it just before now .
I understood it was difficult to explain to write it , too !

B e f or e c a m ing on K e el un g , I heard the r um or about A C ity of S ad ness .
A C ity of S ad ness was f a m ous for the ta i w an mo v i e ' s st age .
I ga ve up it because it need ed too long time .
If I went to there , I could n ' t go to another f a m ous place s .
N e x t I asked her `` What do you re c o m m en d about the place in this c ity ? ``
She told me `` C o ul d you go to the F a ir y C a ve ? `` .
So I de c id ed to go to there .
to be con t in u e . . .
My name L in h .
I ' m 2 0 year s old I ' m come from V i e t n a m .
I ' ve been str a g g ling to understand `` It `` and `` That `` .
I feel when I us e `` It `` , `` It `` de s c ri b es some kind s of im age s .
It see m s long long way .
A f an c y T h ough t s to ce le b r ate a b ir th day
I ' d like to sha re some strange thought s with you , on how I ' d like to or g an i z e a f an c y part y .
Let ' s im a g in e how can I make my sp e c i al b ir th day .
When I want to ce le b r ate my b ir th day , I ' d like to invite too much friend s , I ' d like to re s er ve in a hu g e and beautiful p al a ce , far away from the country .
I ' d de c or ate it with sp e c i al b a ll o on s , which is written on them my name , friend s ' s name , family me m b er s ' name , each one has his own b a ll o on .
The b ir th day have to be sp e c i al one .
When I invite my friend s and then p l an n ing to come over , The a ir p la ne will be wait ing for them .
and they will serve them in anything they want , as well as , and they will present to them sp e c i al and ex p en s ive g if t s that I ' ve p re p ar ed them since along time .
No th ing can take place without the f i re w or k s .
My f i re w or k when it ex p l o d e it will appear my name and my picture as well .
F in ally I would from you to give me mo r al s up p or t .
D o n ' t need money do n ' t need anything just to respon d to my part y , you will be sat i is f i ed
L ate ly , my comp an y need s to have a we b s ite .
So far , we have only need ed st at ic we b sit e not a d y n a m ic one so we do n ' t need da ta b a se .
I was interest ed in this new p l an , al th ough I knew that my de s i g n of we b sit e c a n ' t be comp ar ed to pro f es s ion al de s i g n er e ng in e er .
I still want ed to try so I asked my friend to copy W in d ow serve r 2 0 0 3 and D re a m w e a ver .
My p l an is that I de s i g n it by D re a m w e a ver if it is done , I will e re c t my S er ver 2 0 0 3 .
I ho pe that one day , I could man age r our serve r .
So after get ting off work , I ' ll go to my go d father ' s noodle s sh op and then go to a l i b r ar y near b y to b or r ow re la ted b ook s .
And this can also el im in ate what cause s con f l i ction , such as mi s un d er st and ing about their c ust o m s ,
To tell the tru th , l have n ' t read ed b ook s because l was so bu s y re c ent ly .
want ed to tea ch him p re c ept s to he ' s b a b y .
but him b a b y was so you ng . he have no time to wait for b a b ies gr ow n .
and he de ter m in ed that he will do `` The last conc er t `` f ot him you ng b a b y .
when after the b a b y s gr ow n well , and after he di ed , he make d
see him p re c ept s to b a b ies
The last conc er t was so im f re s s ive d to me .
es pe c a il ly , the b ook make d me think that for g e ted dr e a m when l was you ng
I to st ed some b re ad with the to aster and I at e the b re ad without sp re ad ing anything on it .
The b re ad s m el t good and was very c ri s p y so I end ed up eat ing many of them .

My hu s b and , me and our p ar ent s will go c he er .

I would like to re c i p ro c ate my affect ion to him by to u ch ing him back but I could n ' t do that .
I am not sure that he re ally like s me or just want s to take a d v ant age of me .
One thing for sure I enjoy his comp an ion .

This morning , she came home from the morning ex er c is e ga ther ing in the ne i g h b or h o o d and said ;
I know it ' s very , very in a p p ro p ri ate , but M o ther ' s remark re f r a in ed in my e ar s all day and I had a very hard time try ing not to b ur st into laugh ter .
N e w year ' s day is already over as you and I know , but I still feel like I ha v n ' t take n back my p ow er I had last year .
It may be because of new year ' s ho l i day s , no , I k ic k ed back too much d ur ing the ho l i day s .
My p ow er and spirit s might have f al le n down while I was sp en d ing on dr in k ing and just watch ing T V .
H o l i day s sound re ally good to me , but it see m s to be not good to my body . . .
I watch ed the pro g r a m of To u ha ku H a se g a w a to day .
He was one of a very f a m ous old J a p an e se pai n ter ,
It has been pass ed 4 0 0 year s after his de a th .
am d his ex b i tion is he l d this year in K Y O T O .
My mother tri ed to go there , but it is very p op ul er and she have to wait in line more the one or two hour s . . .
if you have interest in the old J a p an e se pai n ting s , please c he c k this sit e .
L a st sat ur day I ra la x ed in my home with my family .
Yes ter day ( s un day ) I play ed go l f .

I want to enjoy them well .
No z im i , a name of S h in k an s en bu ll e t train , is f a st est and most co m f or t able in J R To k a i line .
I wish you can enjoy K y ot o if you visit K y ot o some day .
la z y i v y said he ll o o o o o o o : (
However , I still for g ot or find any other ex c us e to being la z y .
It ' s a re ally draw b a c k of my person al ity .
`` The trouble of I v y was that she never had a sp e c if ic a im in life . ``
B e c a us e of the no is e , I could n ' t re c or d the l at ter part of the story d ur ing day time .
I ' ll do it this even ing : )
To day I found very interest ing v id e o b l o g s made by K o i ch i , or to f u g u .
H is v id e o s are a w es ome - he has a great sen se of hu m or .
I wish I could make v id e o s like his : D
I ' ve just sign ed up for it just now !
It sound s am a z ing is n ' t it ?
I mean I want to give them a present .
What I want to as k you guy s is what you will b r ing when you visit your friend ' s p ar ent s house .
because I ' m not f a m il i ar with we s ter n c ul ture and it ' s little b it we ir d to as k her what I
I want to c or re c t some po st of written by other me m b er s on la ng - 8 .
I thought It ' s easy if po st written in my language .
But I try to c or re c t con t in u e .
I s ex a c t ly 2 5 minute s before my b ir th day .
In the morning , sea w e ed so up for me , my mo m did .
I like the sea w e ed so up was so de l ic i ous to eat .
I went a head and went to school in a house in a good mo o d .
A r r ive at school and then open the l ock er to take out b ook s the moment I did not con ce al surprise s .
M e my b ir th day present to my be st friend ga ve to the l ock er de c or ation s .
That tri es to put up with tea r s .
B e c a us e it is the first such even t in my life more ha p p y .
I have had express ion s of gra t it ud e to my friend s .
So I since re ly con g r at ul ate the friend s and be ha p p y .
To day is the be st day of my life .
I always for g e t this b ir th day will not .
But the reason s why we call him like that are he is a b it short and look s so c ut e like D or e m on .
He would think that we m ock at him .
T h an k you for read what I write .
co l d we a ther
To day is on T h ur s day .
I feel co o l because co l d we a ther .
even so I will do the be st
I b ro k en with my bo y friend . . .
One reason is that he wish he can work in C h in a .
A no ther reason may be have another person between us .
In fact , I feel very s ad , but I st i il need to work , eat , and so on .
L if e is so hard . .
I want new life !
No w I ' m go w ing some s c a ll ion s , turn i p s , and let t u ce s .
Yes ter day , I me t a friend in our L a b who gradua ted the U n ive r s ity .
I ' m very surprise d and ex cited .
I think we ' ll very bu s y in future , but I want to con t in u e such a re l ation s h i p .
I ho pe to he will work well .
There was the p h r a se `` This better be good `` in a di al o gue in my te x t b ook .
When she tri ed explain ing one is s u e , the s al es direct or as k s her to mo ve on to the next to p ic because it was already me n tion ed in another person ' s present ation .
Then her bo s s tell s him that she ' s got some new idea s that are w or th listen ing to .
And then , the direct or tell s her , `` O K , this better be good . `` , and she answer s `` R i g h t . ``
then I walk around near bu s st ation we ar ing a volunteer c l o th es so that other people can o b v i ous ly see me .
I feel very ha p p y once help ing other people .
As we know n , un or d er ed p h en ome n a can be see n every where in C h in a , and I ho pe the se sit u ation will be change d .
and ho pe our country become a beautiful one .
just like the s l o g an of S ha ng ha i E x po `` better c ity , better life `` .
S t u f f ing st o m a ch by f o o d s is im p or t ant to s up p re s s the sen s ation of hung er .
You might think that you ga in body we i g h t if you eat a l ot .
Yes , you are right .
But if you eat the high v o l um e of l ow c al or i e f o o d s , you will be sat is f i ed with them without long ter m we i g h t ga in .
F or ex amp le c a b b age and let t u ce has only 2 3 and 1 5 k c al per 1 0 0 g , respect ive ly .
Even if 2 k g ( ! ) of let t u ce is con s um ed , you take only 3 0 0 k c al which is c or re s p on d ing to 33 g of f at or the en er g y sp ent in just sit ting for five four s .
K on j a c and a g ar are p ri m ar i ly c al or i e - free and can be ut il i z ed to v o l um e up di e t s as well as l ow c al or i e ve g e t able s such as c a b b age and let t u ce .
O f course , if 2 k g f o o d s or dr in k s are con s um ed , tra n s i ent we i g h t ga in is also 2 k g .
This is e m p ha s i z ed in the e p is o d e of eat ing dis or d er ( E D ) p at i ent s , because they strong ly feel f e ar to ga in we i g h t even if the we i g h t ga in is tra n s i ent .
I think this one ta st es good but my E ur op i an f re in d s see m to do n ' t like it that much .
They prefer a be e f to a p or k .
A n y way , When we got there , we ' re the only c ust ome r in this re st r a un t .
No w that it was little b it e ar ly for di n er .
No matter any on e tell s us , we started dr in k ing from 5 P M .
A fter 2 hour s , We ' ve finish ed about 5 bo t t le s of So j u which is a kind of K or e an tra d i tion al al c o h o l .
So j u con tain s around 2 0 % of al c o h o l , which mean s it ' s pretty strong .
That ' s why all of us were bad ly dr un k .
A fter w ar d s , we went to C h in a town in which we dr an k more al c o h o l .
I was to t ally b l an k ed out so I could n ' t re m e m b er what was going on .
I must have do z ed off for a while and then when I ' ve open ed my eyes , I felt something strange .
Then I re al i z ed that I ' d pass ed 6 st ation s from where I was suppose d to leave .
A fter all , I had to call my c ous in for him to give me a ri d e .
It was almost about 2 A M .
A fter I came to my sweet home .
Then things are look ing up .
I go to the ha ir s h op for change my ha ir style .
just as was expect ed , my ha ir de s i g n er was very kind ly .
A fter I tell to de s i g n er about what I want a ha ir style , I do n ' t care while change my ha ir style .
why I do n ' t care while cha ng ing my ha ir style ,
because I believe him .
A fter finish that , I was very ha p p y .
because sat is f i ed about my change d ha ir style .
I b ough t a b ic y c le machi ne which I can us e in my place two week s a g o .
It ' s one of f a m ous sp or ting good s for those people w o n ' t go outside or re g is ter g y m have to be pai d money .
I think there are a f e w a d v ant age by us ing this .
F ir st , it make me get a s w e at easily than what I ex e pe c t be f o e and this mean s that it also help ful as a a er o b ic ex c er c is e .
A c t u ally , it was so re g re t t ably if I did n ' t go to g y m even th ough I re g is ter month ly me m b er s h i p around my place .
A l th ough there is some a b n or m al no is e , when I p ed al a b ic y c le , the over al re s ul t of us e is gr ate ful .
I had the big e ar th qu a ke with my d aught er at home last F ri day after no on .
As soon as I felt the qu a ke , we went under the t able to pro te c t our head s and open ed the front do or and w in d ow to get es c a pe ro ut e .
A l ot of things felt down out of some she l ve s .
But I stop p ed them , because being outside was more da ng er ous than being at home in Tokyo in which there were so many bu il d ing s .
And my a p ar t ment is re l at ive ly new and e ar th qu a ke - pro o f .
This is because s a f e g u ar d of ga s was work ing .
F or t un ate ly , we can us e water and e le c t ri c p ow er .
We at e in st ant need le s bo il ing water by e le c t ri c p ow er .
No w we can us e ga s .
But some ne ce s s it ies of life are lack ing , such as to i le t paper , ti s s u e and dr y b at ter y .
A t last , I b ough t to i le t paper and dr y b at ter ies this morning .
I ho pe to get back as we are .
I ' m watch ing a b a se b a ll on T V .
because this is a n ic e game to last over 5 hour s .
It is f un for me which ever will w in .

B e c a us e C h in e se go ver n ment is ri s ing a ra te of interest , many small comp an ies find it hard to b or r ow money .

If C h in a or other e m er g ing co un t ri es like B r a z il or In d i a keep ri s ing ra te of interest , I gue s s the re ce s s ion will o c c ur in the near future .
I l o ve co m ic s called `` the al ch e m is t s of the s te el `` .

That is a give - away to y present ed by `` M is ter D on ut `` .

It is my first time to write an English ar t ic le .
M a y b e my heart is afraid , n er v ous .

My friend s suggest ed they ce ment ti le s on my k it ch en wall , then asked which co l or I like more of gra y , w h ite and be i g e .

She said that `` some on e will qu it a job 2 0 th A u g ust in M or i bu d in A k as a k a .
And every on e want you back to work over there , can you do that ? ? ? ``

Even my s is ter said to me you that `` You should go back to the job ! ! I I ' m sure it 2 0 0 % ! !
A time like this , I make sure I eat something so that I ' ll dr op off as soon as I lie down .

But now , became very im p or t ant in c ome for me .

U p on see ing what I b ough t , my little so n looked dis a p po in ted because I b ough t more c l o th es for his el d er brother and did n ' t bu y short s for him which I told him that I would bu one for him y .

they de st ro y ed f a m ous place with great natural l and s c a pe s and also dr ive d out many an im al s and p l ant s from their ha b it at .
the go ver n ment did n ' t accept dis s ent of people because of their be ne f it s .

But they were all n ic e , we could be good friend s .
* A re there va ri ous line s between j o ke s , straight line s , c ur b ed line s , z i g z a g line s ?
We call year - end part y bo n en k a i .
So a bo n en k a i is a part y for for g e t ting the year .
We for g e t the trouble s of the past year , and we start the new year .
This time I try to read this b ook in English .
H ar u k i M ur a k a m i is one of the f a m ous J a p an e se write r in E ur o pe but I think that it is difficult to tra n s l ate his works because his way to write no ve l s is re ally a b st r a c t and is n ' t o b v i ous .
When he got F r an z Ka f k a p ri z e in 2 0 0 6 , he qu ot ed the sen t ence from the letter of F r an z Ka f k a to his friend .
We have two big purpose s to go to H o k k a id o ; one purpose is , of course , to go sight se e ing , and the other is to go to conc er t s of F u j if a b ri c .
This is the second time I go to H o k k a id o in my life , and when I went to H o k k a id o two year s a g o for the first time , I went with ex a c t ly the same friend s with the same purpose !
The conc er t s were great ( we went to two conc er t s , both he l d in S a p po ro ) and we at e many de l ic i ous me al s includ ing s us h i , c ur ry and noodle , and b ough t many so u ve n ir s .
This time , we went to O t ar u , which is about one - hour train ri d e no r th w est of S a p po ro .
The ma in street was c r ow d ed with so many to ur t is t s , who come from home and a b ro ad .
The town has un i qu e at m o s p he re with a l ot of no st al g ic bu il d ing s so no wonder so many people are at t r a c ted to the town .
It was e ar ly O c t o b er and just start ing to become ch il ly , but not too co l d as expect ed .
The se day I ' m do ing part time job to tra ve l E ng l and .
I T h in k that I can s a ve enough money to tri p U K unti l s um m er .
In my un ive r s ity I set up big go al and small go al .
B e f or e I take the class , I only read my v o c a b ul ar y not e b ook about three time s a week , but I le ar n d many str ate g ies how to ex p and my v o c a b ul ar y in my un ive r s ity .
F or ex amp le ma k ing up sen t ence s con tain ing new w or d s , us ing a we b s ite , keep ing a di ar y , and so on .
It in c re a se my con f id ence very much .
M or e o v re , I put v o c a b ul ar y ta g s my f un i ture .
I ' m little b it sh y .
It is the good ch ance of cha ng ing my person al ity .
I ' ve been s la c k at my study for s ever al month .
When I had a new s about I can put some me s s age and commen t on ce ll p h on es from la ng - 8 , I ' m feel ing study English again .
And I ' m think ing to im p ro ve my English s k i ll .
I ' ll read English b ook s as many as I can .

He dis a g re e to give ti p to a wait re s s because so c i e ty tell s him to .
I agree with him because some r ul es in the so c i e ty is made to please a gr o up of people and this gr o up is expect ing other gr o up s to agree with them .
U n less some on e is part of the gr o up the r ul e does n ' t a p p ly .

A fter watch ing a his t or ical mo v i e I always c he c k the W i k i p ed i a to cross ch e c k the history i nformation .
This is my first di ar y .
I start this s er v ic e five minute s a g o .
My w if e and I watch ed B i o ha z ar d .
In the mo v i e , the ma in character act ed by M il la J o v o v i ch try to help people who can not go out from a bu il d ing because there are many un d e ad out of the bu il d ing .
We were re ally ex cited about the story but some time s were not able to see the s c re en because there were some gr ot es qu e scene s .
A fter watch ing mo v i e , we went to a b ook st or e and b ough t a b ook , which is about English al p ha b e t train ing b ook for ch il d re n .
A c t u ally , my w if e is now p re g n ant and we p re p ar e for my ch il d re n .
We came back to home t ow n and went to an In d i an re st a ur ant that we had never been to .
We were also as t on ish ed because , in J a p an , there are not so many for e i g n re st a ur ant s which run over five year s .
A fter eat ing , we pro m is ed that we come here again .
P le a se c or re c t my di ar y .
A c t u ally , I st ud i ed English in another way but I think it ' s the most im p or t ant thing that tra n s m it ting your thought in your a im ed language .
And it ' s better to get it c or re c ted by n at ive speak er s and to study on it .
I re al i z ed again how co m f or ting to be with them is .
It is also n ic e to be with my one - way - l o v ed one but it s re l ation s h i p now str a in my heart now a little .
L a st S un day I went on a d ate with her , but while I was with her I could n ' t be

I want to come to feel re la x when I am next to her ! !
I am a not la z y mother I think , but some time s I do s el f ish .
so I have p l ent y of time to do anything I want .
The one is S e ve n P ound s
I still could n ' t de s c ri b e the se mo v ies in English , but I had a good time , and I also got some new w or d s and some p h r as es from the mo v ies .
I might have been st u c k in the house because of the s n ow if I w o ke up just a b it more la ter .
I came to my office before s n ow ing he a v i ly .
I think it ' s l u c k y because it ' ll be hard to come here because of s n ow tomorrow .
S n ow c ous es many tra f f ic de la y s here because it does n ' t of ten s n ow .
When I was a ch il d , I got ha p p y to see it s n ow ed .
But it is a b it good for me that it s n ow s because I can enjoy f ant a st ic scene ry .
`` C o m ing of sp r ing ``
This morning , I was walk ing to a s up er m ar ke t near b y my house .
While walk ing , I not ic ed leave s of tree s were bu d d ing , and were p re p ar ing for the coming sp r ing even though the we a ther was co l d and t ough .
That made me feel re fresh ed and ha p p y , and I re al i z ed that I could n ' t a f f or d to pay at ten tion to the se kind of little , but n ic e things the se days .
I went to tri p with teachers yesterday .
A t S h ow a no machi was e m b o d i ed show a per i o d so I felt a good old me m or y r us h ed into my mind .
That ' s way some time s I want to give up but my con s c i ence do n ' t let me do this even because I will need it while living here .

L a st night I saw the mo v i e which ti t le is `` U p In The A ir `` .
It was very mo v ing story .
I think over it is im p or t ant to have friend s , l o ver s , and family .
In mo v i e , there is such a w or d .
T h in k it over , there are many people s around me ,
and I am always s up p or ted by many people s .
So I feel ha p p y to day .
I think I will more than k to my friend s , a l o ver , and family .
We have our first w ed d ing an n ive r s ar y on F e b r u ar y 1 4 .
It is M on day , so we have a little home part y on S un day , 1 3 .
My p ar ent s and my a un t will come our house at l un ch to ce le b r ate us .
What is my re al s el f ?
So , there something is we do n ' t like but we need say `` I like that `` .
Some th ing is a se c re t , you c a n ' t tell your friend . : )
What should I do .
What I can do .
Why c a n ' t we tell us something that is tru e . ( or not )
So now the only things we can do is keep our f ing er s cross !
I live with my house m ate called E n a .
She im i g r at ed from K or e a to A m er ic a 1 5 year s a g o .
When I came here in the U S A , I was look ing for ho us ing .
So , I found E n a ' s a p ar t ment on the in ter ne t .
A fter talk ing with her , I mo v ed in this place .
When I ar ri v ed this a p ar t ment , I had for g ot ten she has 3 d aught er called M in a , T al i and M ir a .
I think M in a look s like her father , but I ' m not sure because she does n ' t look like E n a .
She is a b it st u b b or n , but very sweet , out g o ing and s m ar t .
M ir a is 4 year s old , but she is a very hard girl .
I have never me t like this girl before .
Some time she is very l o ve ly when I give her some ch o c o l ate s .
Some time I ' m think ing like that .
If I re f us ed to live her d aught er s , how change my life in S an F r an c is c o .
: ) F ir st month , when I start to live them , I felt I was very n er v ous and str es s ful .
But now , I can feel co m f or t able and I knew how put myself into another ' s place .
It ' s c or re c t : A n a ly s is on an E ar ly M o d er n English play ?
The e ar th qu a ke s s c ar e me , but I can stay my home at least .
I even have water s up p ly and e le c t ri c ity s up p ly since the even ing of yesterday .
The da ng er of n u c le ar also make s me ho r ri f i ed .
I do n ' t have much i nformation or know led g e .
I went to see a l ot of ch er ry tree s to O s a k a about se ve n year s a g o .
There is a pretty f a m ous place to see them in O s a k a and it s name is Z O U H E I K Y O K U .
There was about 1 0 0 me ter s street and va ri ous ch er ry tree s line d up on both side s of it .
That was re ally beautiful !
I ' d never know n that there were so many kind s of ch er ry b l o s s o m s and I ' d never see n gr e en one s in my life .
That was a very s ur p ri s ing to me .
I want to go some where for ch er ry b l o s s o m s this year too .
The se day s some of my co w or k er s have got co l d and we ar ma s k s .
Let me co un t . . . my bo s s , tea m me m b er ( he ' s a b s ent to day ) , other three co w er k er s . . almost one th ir d of my se ction .

If you live in J a p an e , pay at ten tion s to your he al th .
I ' m b re a k in d my re c or d of keep ing good he al th in two or more year s : )
I did n ' t understand the con t ent of the mo v i e very much when I watch ed the mo v i e for the first time because I was w or th at English then .
The C ri m s on c l o ud s
The C ri m s on c l o ud s is re ally beautiful .
My ma ther and I have took a walk in this even ing .
And the c l o ur of s k y was re f le c ted on la ke .
L ot s of people who were play ing out d o o s have said such of this scene ry was re ally beautiful .
I have took a picture of the se c l o ud s
I have n ' t us e English for a long per i o d s .
I think I for g ot all of gra m m er s and v o c o b ul ar ies .
so , If I have time that I will try to write my di ar y in English
The so c c er ma t ch with k or e a and j a p an is start ing now .
K or e a and j a p an are ri v al in the so c c er since long a g o .
We have a ga m ble how do our tea m s c or e a go al with money pai d for dr in k .
F e w minute s a g o , I was talk ing w i z my g f .

I thought now is the ra in y sea s on in N Y as well as in J a p an .
But , my co ll e gue told me there is not the ra in y sea s on in N Y and the we a ther this year is un like usual N Y .
I felt the c l im in ate in J a p an was get ting w ar m er and w ar m er in s ever al year s .
I wonder ed J a p an became a part of So ut he a st As i a in a respect .
We can see ex t r a or d in ar y c l im in ate every are a a cross the g l o b e .
It ' s time to consider the en v ir on ment al is s u e serious ly .
He ll o ! E ver y on e , this we b s ite was told by my for e i g h teacher , I had hard ly open ed my la p t op when I come back home , this is begin n ing , I ho pe I can make more new friend s from who le world .

I was give n many f e a st s like a s and ra ic e b a ll , a s and p an c a ke , a s and j u ic e , a s and me at , , e t c .
I think that they feel sp e c i al va l u e about s and .
I do not understand because I am el d er ly man .
How to im p ro ve listen ing s k i ll

What else sit c o m do you re c o m m en d me ?
I pack ed my thing to mo ve to p r u e t t ' s house tomorrow and was so tired from this work that I started to watch `` S u id o u `` on my la p t op to re fresh myself .
That ' s sign if ic ant ly funny T V cha n n el in J a p an !
We went to there very e ar ly to bu y good s , but I could n ' t bu y a good s because everything I want ed was so l d out : ( I think their p op ul ar ity is so great .
E ver y on e of the conc er t ha ll was ex cited .
B I G B A N G was so near , so I was so surprise d but ha p p y !
I was able to watch them in the n a k ed e y e .
I c a n ' t come back to a fact of life .
l o l My ar m s are m us c ul ar pai n because I w a v ed hard a p en light .
In this morning , I knew that B ud w e is er had got ten b ough t out by In b e v two year s a g o .

But , the bu y o ut happen ed on 1 5 J u ly , then L e h man sh ock happen ed on 1 5 S ept e m b er .
A ccord ing to N P R , the st ock B ud own ed was so f e w ( only 4 % ) that they could n ' t keep themselves .
It ' s a p le as ant ly surprise for p ar ent s when they see the new b or n .
As the in c re as ing ly im p ro v ing s c i ence , more and more p re m a ture b a b y s u v ive with the help like the dr u g , in c u b at or , o x y g en and so on .
But people may not know that with a p re m a ture body , the b a b y may get N R D S , R O P , N E C and a l ot of compli c ation s .
But you may not ex p ri ence j o y like that a d y ing b a b y had been re s c u e and gr e w large r .

It ' s very us e ful for me because it ' s so easy a ction .
I may have a business tri p to C o l or ad o A m er ic a and M on t re al C an ad a .
When I went A m er ic a last s um m er , I could get a ch ance to make a present ation to them in English .
But I could n ' t understand what they a d v is ed for me .
A t that time , I could n ' t say `` I c a n ' t understand what you are talk ing `` and as k `` C an I as k what do you mean ? `` .
I co m m un ic at ed with n at ive speak er .
C o ul d you speak more s l ow ly with us ing e as i er p h r a se ?
If I can go there , It would be good op p or t un ity to im p ro ve my English .

To day , we he l d a works h op in S en d a i B r an ch .
It took three hour s by S h in k an s en to S en d a i .
To make matter s w or se , It was a one - day business tri p .
S t i ll hot to day .
I went to in ter v i e w in j a p an e se re st ur ant .
I never write English re s um e , so the time was very con s um ed .
I ' m wait ing re p ly .
B y the way , I was very a ng ry for Tokyo G o ver n or S h in ta ro I s h i h ar a !
B e c a us e he said , the t s un a m i is a re t ri b u tion against J a p an .
How could he say that ? I c a n ' t believe him !
M a y b e I ' m go n n a con t in u e to find a part - time job tomorrow .
W ri te my thought s and feel ing s in a N e t w or k No t p ad .
It see m s that in the next re fresh .
When I had just finish ed my di ar y , the line was s ud d en ly c ut off and l los t of them , o m g !
But more im p or t ant ly , is not this .
the p age is close d s ud d en ly !
I started p i an o last S ept e m b er at co m m un ity co ll e g e , and finish ed begin n er s class last month .
It was very hard for me to finish this course at the end , since I did n ' t have any ex pe ri ence before in my life .
I do n ' t want to have a has s le and he c t ic days any m or e in this year , so de c id ed to take a class once a week this year .
And it just started from to day .
I will just keep up my p i an o s k i ll for f un .

She see m s has ex a m s to day .
A n hour la ter she began to study ma th , she asked .
`` N a o , I did n ' t so l ve this question .
C an I tea ch me ? ``
It ' s very difficult !
But I surprise d at I for g ot like this .
And I knew a stuff again .
A no ther la z y day . .
I just do nothing ex c ept s ur f ing on the ne t and re st ing , but I have 4 E x a m s coming ! ! ! !
S e c on d , the job need s to ful f i ll me since I do n ' t want to feel like I was te my time just to make money .
I have to be care ful about de c id ing my job and set ting the way to a ch ive the dr e a m because it is not like I ' m very you ng or I have many op tion s since I do n ' t have enough money .
So I will try to do my be st to find my way s and a ch ive it rather than being f r ust r at ed about my bad sit u ation .
In my last po st , I said about L F s and L R .
A no ther point of view : all kind s ( ty pe s ? ) of re l ation s h i p s is b as ed on it .
B us i ness b as ed on will for make money .
There are many another ex amp le s , but there is one simple conc l us ion - different re l ation s h p may b as ed on different b as es , but only co m m un ic ation is mean s for re l ation s h i p ma k ing .
O ur re l ation s h i p s is b as ed on my l o ve for so f t and f l u f f y and his will to eat .
N a b e is tra d i tion al f o o d in J a p an .
It is very simple c ook ing me n u .
There are va ri ous f la v or s such as K I M U C H I ( K or e an ta s te ) , M I S O , S O Y S O U C E , S O L T , C U R R Y and so on .
E s pe c i ally , it is eat en very much in w in ter sea s on because it make s our body hot .
I was look ing for the s and al .
But , even t u ally I could ' t bu y the like s and al .
I will try to look ing for c ut e s and al to m m or ow .
To day I w o ke up 3 : 0 0 A M , And I en j y o ed the so c c er game on t v .
H on d a is honor able J a p an e se .
When I was e le ment a ly s c o o l , A L T teacher from A ust r al i a show ed us picture s of nature , sea , k o al a and so on in his class .
R e c ent ly , J a p an has been de ve l op ing and many bu il d ing s has been bu il t , and w a can not see the nature in J a p an because the am o un t of it is de c re as ing .
And I have never go ne a b ro ad and see the sen er y a p ar t from J a p an .
So I saw such a sen er y of picture for the first time .
I thought as if it had been a different world .
A fter the class , I ho pe to live in A ust r al i a .
It is g en er ally believe d that J a p an e se language does n ' t have ar t ic le s .
To day I will re v i e w about us age of ar t ic le s .
* I visit ed a town which is f a m ous as a hot sp r ing re s or t .
The town of this sen t ence is a one of f a m ous town s .
In this case , a f a m ous town ex is t s only this one .
In addition , a w or d `` ar t ic le `` it s el f is p u z z ling too .
When ever I see this w or d , I in ter p re t as new s p a p er ar t ic le .
U n f or t un ate ly I have n ' t finish all of my work l o ad this week .
So I ' ll be for ce to be on d ut y tomorrow .
I apologize to you for short not ic e
To day is the day of J a p an ' s los e of the b at t le against A m er ic a .
On 1 5 , A u g ust , 1 94 5 , J a p an has los t the w ar against A m er ic a .
I know it was fool of J a p an to b at t le against A m er ic a .
We could not w in A m er ic a because our te ch no l o g y was poor .
We must a c k n ow led g e our f a il ur e ; we los t the w ar .
But I believe we have another f a il ur e , too .
A fter the w ar , we have s u c ce ed ed in gr ow ing the e c on o m y and we got better living stand ar d .
We long ed we s ter n life and our c ul ture was we s ter n i z ed .
But then we have los t the I D E N T I T Y and C U L T U R E of J A P A N .
You can im a g in e what is J a p an e se c ul ture .
O f co ur ce , Ka b u k i , W a k a , S a m ur a i , Ya m at o , W a b i S a b i and so on .
But J a p an e se , living to day do n ' t watch Ka b u k i , s ing W a k a and H a i ku , do n ' t watch S a m ur a i .
No w a day s our life s ty le is all we s ten i z ed , but we los t J a p an e se c ul ture at the same time .
We are not J a p an e se ; more ex a c t ly , we are not what we us ed to be .
In ' L A st S a m ur a i ' , which To m C r u is f e at ur ed , this idea was the sub j e c t .
A f t r er the w ar , we s u c ce ed en in e c on o m y , but we los t our c ul ture .
We are not strong in e c on o m y any m or e to day .
I believe this is the big g est ch ance for J a p an e se to re g a in our id ent i y i and c ul ture and to work to g e ther with each other .
it ' s go r g e us .
Even though I b ough t it only 5 0 0 yen ( about $ 5 ) .
I c a n ' t believe it s p ri ce is only small mo un t s .
in my opinion , f a m ous F re n ch w in e or something are not e qu al to their co st s .
I think the se are not va l u e as much as s el ling p ri ce .
I l o ve A ust r al i an & A m er ic an too , there are many number of good w in e c a p able of bu y ing it from like me , having not too much money because so you ng .
He y , please any on e tell me how good F re n ch w in e is !
I usual ly listen to the English con ver s ation pro g r a m or watch ing English T V dr a m a with P S P ( P S P stand s for P la y S t ation P or t able ) on the train .
I went to C o st c o with my f ri en s some days before .
My friend re c o m m ed the c he er i o s for me .
And I found a great thing when I would pay the ce re al .
- ch o c o l ate ch un k .
It was similar to the c ook ies made by teachers .
I l o ve the c ook ies hand m ad e by teachers .
It was an act i v ity he l d by my high school in C h ri st m as time .
T e a ch er s made the c ook i e and so l d them .
the t u i tion hard ly .
I p ic k ed up my has b and at morning .
I think easy to go to there , because to day is sat a day .
But many tra f f ic , , , , I ha te tra f f ic .
A fter l un ch , I went to off ic i al kid s play sp a ce but there was close d , too bad .
So I play ed with my sweet d aught er at front of my house .
We take a walk a l it t el , then I heard do g ' s voice .
and I saw a bo y , he stand ing be s id e water way .
I can not believe my eyes .
There was a do g , it was very old and s k in n y .
I he l d my da u g ter so I can not help .
I called to hu s b and help a do g .
just then one man come and help .
He p ic k ed up a do g but a do g f e ll down again .
He p ic k ed up again and next to take to some house .
I don ot know after .
I ho pe to a do g can back his ( her ) house .
hi , guy s .
My name is N ic k y , T a i w an e se , 2 3 year - old and I w an n a le ar n some English , p l z f i x my English and tea ch something wrong in my j o ur n al s than k s ! and if some on e want to le ar n some C h in e se u could tell me , I will ing to do that .

and so on , we will be the good friend ! leave ur me s s age and some commen t , a p p re c ite ! ! !
There ' s some funny things happen to my life ~
A c t ur ally , I sat on the floor all night to write the b l o g , write the di ar y and as k friend how to transfer to English . ~ * * ~ It make s me s c at ter ed ~ like `` bu st ling street `` or `` p re s s the bu s be ll `` .
@ @ I also change my job .
I for g ot I w ro te on last es s a y or not ? ?
My job is not l u c k y .
There is too much st or es near b y .
There is an go l d access or ies next to my st or e and op p is it ed to B o o st .
It ' s a good way B o o st is next to my st or e , so that some c ust ome r s go to see my pro d u c t s when they are wait ing for dr in k s or friend s .
O r some c ust ome r s might say something s that mean s they want to have a dis c o un t .
And that kind of sit u ation just like the business in mar ke t in my country .
I never think that will happen in other co un t ri es , es pe c i ally in w h ite people ' s world .
In my opinion , they of ten bu y pro d u c t s in st or es direct ly and they do n ' t do b ar g a in .
B ar g a in is too tired for me ~ X D
The end , I will work hard to my job .
My friend told me there is another job having more money to e ar n ! ! ! ~ ^ ^ ~ Y A ~
In a di al o gue I st ud i ed the other day , there was a sen t ence `` why , than k you . `` Some on e prais ed a dress one woman was we ar ing .
I heard it for the first time and felt it strange .
It ' s se c re t now .
A c t u ally , I want to work and e ar n many .
B e c a us e I have a l ot of things that I want to do and want to bu y .
So to day I go to in ter v i e w .
P ro b ably , you know .
I want to get a s ing le - l en s re f le x came r a for a long time .
D re a m ing future is interest ing .
P le a se c he er me !
A l th ough no on e c or re c ted my di ar y , I did some on e ' s J a p an e se one .
It ' s my first ent ry on la ng - 8 .
And , I do n ' t even know what to write .
I ' m a 2 4 - year - old girl , b or n and raise d in ti n y sub ur b town in J a p an .
live d with my family ti ll 1 9 and left to the state s to study what ever .
I was look ing down on all ty p ical co ll e g e kid s in J a p an when I was 1 8 I gue s s .
so u ve n i re . .
N e x t month , I ' ll go to school in B o st on for two week s to study English , and visit to N e w Y or k for 4 days for sight se e ing .
I want to b r ing so u ve n ir f o e my ho st f a m il ies .
I happen ed to know the so ng `` do n ' t know why `` that was s un g by no r a h j on es was also s un g by an e ng l and s ing er who se name is `` j on i ke en ``
I felt there is a dis t in c t di f f er ence between no r a h j on es and j on i ke en while I was listen to it .
E s pe c i ally the me l o d y of p i an o is enough to get my b a b y e re c t .
I tri ed to look for the U R L that con tain s this so ng for you all read ing my ar t ic le could be able to listen to .
but It ' s hard to look for .
if you w an n a listen to this so ng , sen d me a request to sen d by e m a il .
Yes , ti t le of my not e is b an al , but I can not in v ent nothing better
A t first I want to tell about me some g en er al fact s .
I ` m a r us s i an girl who live in the so u th of R us s i a , in K r as no d ar are a , in small town name d K ro po t k in .
I play g u it ar , watch an im e ( y es , I ` m one of _ the te _ > _ > ) and le ar n English .
And I want to become an or i ent al is t .
So I must pass English ex a m , but my stand ar t of English know led g e not very high t .
And what can I tell you more ?
I can not think up anything now .
D id I make some mistake s in this te x t ?
It ta st ed good ex c ept s te w
The view po in t of speak er is all f a c ul ty should work outside re le v ant to the course s they tea ch .
One hand , p rofessor s who work outside will know which te ch no l o g y is more us e ful in fact u al pro j e c t s .
There are so many the or ies in one a c ad e m ic f i el d , for ex amp le , in so f r w ar e e ng in e er ing , j a v a and c + + are both very us e ful pro g r a m m ing language s .
P rofessor s should p ic k one language to give the students more impress ion and con p re he s ion .
In C h in a , c + + is us ed more f re qu ent ly than j a v a ; con se qu ent ly , the a ch er s should pay more at ten tion to c + + .
S t ud ent s who le ar n more us e ful te ch no l o g y will have a big a d v ent age to find a job .
In addition , work ing outside will give p rofessor s another understand ing of their own study ing f i el d .
In some circumstance s , the or ies in te x t b ook s are no u es in tru e life .
However , a p rofessor who has work ing ex pe ri ence may not agree , because the f aster one may co st much more than the normal one .
In st r u ction s of the two kind s of teachers will not be the same ; and the la ter is more us e ful to students .
N ever th e less , not all course s are st ud i ed for us ing ; such as al g e b r a , we may not find a job , which is just us ing it to work .
M or e o ver , it is better st ud i ed on c amp as s , in la b , not in comp an y .
There may not have a pro j e c t to us e it direct ly .
As a re s ul t , p rofessor s should not was te time in find ing job s .
As B er t u ar d R us se ll said , `` E x pe ri ce without le ar n ing is better than le ar ing without ex pe ri ence `` .
E ver y p rofessor of a c ad e m ic course s that has op p or t un ity to work outside ; the other s may stay on c amp as s .
F or students ' future , un ive r s it ies should find more op p p r t un it ies to give their p rofessor s .
In that way , both p rofessor s and students c a p a c ity will im p ro ve .
F in ally , I ' ve finish ed my all work of the week to day .
A l th ough I ' m ex ha ust ed and sleep y , I ' m look ing for w ar d to go to my n i e ce ' s b ir th day part y tomorrow .
B e f or e the part y , I ' ll get enough sleep first .
hi my name ' s mar c o .

But , I los t 2 ar t ic le s , what a great comp an y .
I do n ' t want to any m or e such a pro ble m , G o o g le : (

And work ing in comp an y that l o c ate is close to O s a k a T en man g u ( O s a k a S h in t o S h ri ne ) .
How does J a p an e se a c c ent sound ?
J a p an e se people ten d to have a strong a c c ent , but see m s like it ' s o k a y for girl s , because it some h ow sound s c ut e .
But what if it ' s guy s ?
To night As i an C up
The world may not care for this , but there is a big game to day .
It is a f o ot b a ll game of J a p an v s A ust r al i a at f in al .
I wonder why A us s i e is in As i a .
Well , it ' s O K we had more good tea m s in As i an C up .
They are big and strong , also many of them play a b ro ad .
Then , I have to qu it writing this .
Yes , I ' m th in - s k k in ed .
The C h in e se M ir We i , 43 year s old , was up se ted with a police a ction in He ch i , in C h in a , and pro t est ed get ting n a k ed and c l im b ing over a high ten s ion w i re .
I w an n a have some friend s from other country on face b ook because I have no one .
P le a se , any on e can speak e ng l ish even a little , can a d d me .
I want to p r a c t ic e English writing and cha ting more .
And any on e who want to le ar n T ha i or get a question about it , you can feel free to as k me but you have to us e English to be in ter m ed i ate because I can only us e this , or if you good at T ha i enough and w an n a talk with me by T ha i , that ' s o k .
P le a se leave your E - ma il here or a d d me at m um a g a g i @ hot m a il .
M or e F ri en d s M or e F un
I do n ' t have any s ch ed ul es to day .
I would go to N a g a o k a k y o c ity in K y ot o to day .
This purpose was bu y ing f a m ous b a k ed p or k s .
When I watch e a T V pro g r a m , I knew the st or e .
I sea r ch ed it through the in ter ne t and
many people l o v ed it s b a k ed p or k s .
However , yesterday , when I b r ow s ed the in ter ne t , I found the
b l o g that it has been c l o s ing unti l A p ri l .
`` S or ry , we have been c l o s ing unti l A p ri l for re ne w al . ``
I can not be here in K y ot o unti ll A p ri l because of my job .
I want to go some where on ho l i day .
But , I have no s ch ed ul es to day .
I know that I have to study English and else .
I am writing first di ar y now .
To day , I play ed the f l ut e in the school .
I had a b re a k f a st and I went to school .
I like me m b er s of bra s s b and !
F ir st of all , the di f f er ence of tra f f ic r ul e between U S and J a p an is .
I felt the ro ad s are not p a v ed well comp ar ing to J a p an .
F in ally , dr i v ing manner is .
I than k ed to go d for my ar ri v al to the hotel without any a c c id ent .
I b re at he de e p ly to le ad the so o th ing s c ent of we t e ar th into my l un g s along with the rather co l d and we t b re e z e that to u ch es my face .
My hand s get co l d before other ' s hand s does , usual ly .
The ro t ting board s are ma k ing their f in al tri es to hold each other .
F ro m between them a big ga r d en could be see n , many w il d p l ant s are living with the ga r d en tree s now , which I do n ' t suppose were all ow ed to , when hu man s were living here .
This c r ow d ed ga r d en is the that ta ll est p in e tree ' s b ir th p la ce .
N as r in point s to some c r ow s s ing ing and da n c ing to g e ther over a p is ta ch i o tree in the night dress es they always were .
W o n ' t we be all so s ad if we do n ' t he ar the c r ow s me s s age of the start of a new sea s on ?
To day I ' ll tell you about my s ch ed ul e of a tri p to Tokyo .
So I ' ll leave him to let him sleep well the night .
We ' ll enjoy N a k a m is e street that is a p ed est ri an ma ll le ad ing to S en s o - j i T e m p le from the Ka m in ar i - mo n .
We ' ll find many small sh op s which se ll tra d i tion al J a p an e se it e m s and f o o d , line up on both side s of the street .
I went to p re p ar e for `` Y o m is e `` d ur ing morning to day .
To day was very hot and hu m id .
I w or ri ed about get ting he at dis or d er .
I was very tired because of hot .
This picture is of `` C ha m us um e `` who as s is t to serve co l d gr e en tea last year .
Yes ter day there was a T V pro g r a m on A l - J a z e er a h - C h il d re n cha n n el , in each e p is o d e of this pro g r a m they ho st a ch il d or te en age r and let him live s his dr e a m job , and me e t some on e works in the same job .
In yesterday e p is o d e they ho st ed a girl , she can speak A r a b ic and F re n ch , and she dr e a m s to work as `` In ter p re ter `` , she me t some on e who work as `` In ter p re ter `` , a person who tra n s l ate s a speech from language to other in st ant ly , this person works in United N ation s and tra n s l ate s speech es in the s es s ion s .
They show how this job is the most difficult job in translation , because the in ter p re ter should listen , think of the mean ing , speak and listen to the next sen t ence in the same time without any mistake .
They also show how this in ter p re ter c a n ' t work more than 3 0 minute s , because his job need a l ot of conc ent r ation , and he should take a re st every half hour .
The girl did a great job in translation , and I think she would be a good in ter p re ter in future .
To day is D e ce m b er 1 1 , S at ur day .
I make b re a k f a st from now .
I ' m going to make a to a st , a f ri ed e g g and a p ot at o s al ad .

It ' s just 1 0 day s this year .
R e c ent ly , I ' m make ing a new year c ar d de s i g n .
But , I could n ' t think n ic e de s i g n .

B y the way , I heard di f f el ent a new year some country .
J A P A N ' s new year is on J an u ar y .
C h in a ' s new year is on F e b r u ar y .
In d i a and B an g la d es h new year are on A p ri l .
When are you come ing a new year at your country ?
T h r ough writing it , I found that one of the name ' s or i g in is re la ted with the name of the job .
To day , I work ed on gradua tion re p or t .
I read some ar t ic le s to get the us e ful i nformation .
I think `` The N ame `` have some effect to people ' s life .
So I ' m going to name my so n in the future that . . .
I watch ed the re st of the `` 2 4 sea s on 6 `` .
I ' ll be able to catch up the l ate st sea s on with in this year .
In that dr a m a , many short respon se are re pe at ed ly us ed in con ver s ation .
However , some p h r as es are very co m m on in da i ly con ver s ation , such as the p h r as es the c i v il i an s ' con ver s ation s before being in v o l v ed in a c ri m e , the p h r as es us ed in the meeting s in the W h ite H ous e , and so on .
I found the p h r a se , `` What are you talk ing about ? `` in many scene s .
so I have been st u c k at home .
It will be co l d next three days .
I will stay at home the se days with read ing a b ook .
O ur de p ar t ment hold a dr in k ing part y to day .
I ' m a light dr an k er and I do n ' t like al c o h o l .
So , I do n ' t like a dr in k ing part y very well .
I le ar n ed some w or d s and express ion s yesterday and I ' ll try to write a short sen t ence .
( 1 ) I went out with an um b re ll a in this morning because the we a ther for e c a st said that there would be the ch ance of show er s in the even ing .
( 3 ) To pro ve that the machi ne did n ' t have any de f e c t s , the e ng in e er brought it to a ha l t for a three days and c he c k it up thoroughly .

( 6 ) You are el i g i ble for get ting a sp e c i al dis c o un t provide d you b r ing the c ar d we sen t last week unti l further not ic e .

My t w it ter I D is `` a k ar i 1 3 1 `` for English follow er s .
It ' s k un i p en .
If you find me on t w it ter , please follow me .
To day I w o ke up with smile .
To day I had b re a k f a st with sp o on .
To day I took a bath with so p .
To day I went out with my p ar ent s , then di n er with them .
To day I am very ha p p y so much .
R e c ent ly I saw it .
A c t ul ly So u th K or e a ' s people us a ul ly do n ' t interest ing about No r th K or e a .
O f c or se , some people who es N G O , hu man right s & ch ur ch they are conc er n ed about No r th K or e a .
act ul ly I did n ' t know about my b l o o d re l at ive s before I saw it .
I do n ' t think that the mo v i e tell s us to everything .
that ' s going to far , to say the least . . .
S t or y is about a no r th k or e a ' s man .
He had a family ; a w if e , a kid .
Some day he ' s w if e had been sick ing , but the man can find a me d ic in e .
They just had just f e w c or n f l o ur and w if e was d y ing .
So , he de c i ed e that go to C h in a and go back to No r th K or e a after find some me d ic in s .
The next story is . .
con t ent s are good .
very s ad story .
g l o b al new s said to us ,
And the mo v i e story is just one of a l ot of people ' s life .
I c ri ed a f e w time s when I was w a c th ing the mo v i e .
T h in k ing about that if I was the man who has a sick ing w if e but c a n ' t find the me d ic in e and f o o d is d c re as ing . . .
No r th K or e a and C h in a is very friend ly
But , if no r th k or e an person is de te c ted by public police of C h in a or No r th K or e a d ur ing a man pass b or d er , 8 of 1 0 is di ed .
by go ver ment .
Even though people try to that es c a pe no r th k or e a . . .
They be t who le thing because just live .
B i g s al e
I want s um m er j a c ke t , so that I went to big s al e with my w if e .
I have been ch o o s ing many j a c ke t s , f in ally I b ough t two j a c ke t s .
One is a n a v y b l u e , and other one is a c he c k er ed .
I like the se , so much .
My w if e got many c l o th es which she like s .
We have had been having f un sh op p ing to day .
L a st week , I went to a business tri p in L on d on .
It was s n ow .
In my business tri p , I visit ed to M o d er n T ate , and I b ough t a T - shirt s .
Some person said s that B ri tain f o o d is not ta s ty .
But I do n ' t think so .
I in Tokyo have found a l ot of matter s by the To h o ku Ka n t o serious dis aster .
1 , we can s a ve e le c t ri c ity , there f or e we had sp en d much p ow er . ( F or ex amp le , people of a family work in a same room so that they can s a ve en er g y . )
2 , I have got ch ance s to help my family , and co m m un ic at ing my family has gr ow n up more than ever before .
3 , I found that my person al se c ur ity have to pro te c t by myself , but I should co op er ate people
4 , A l ot of i nformation is con f us ed us , thus I always have to think what I need an im p or t ant i nformation .
5 , I ` m more act ive , because the G o d help ed us .
So I think I will face many big pro ble m s in the future , but I believe I can over c ome .
No w , I ` m conc er n ed about water pro ble m : water in the Ka n t o re g ion has gradua l ly become con ta m in at ed by F u ku s h im a D a i i ch i N P P .

But I got ta keep try ing .
H a ve I told that I keep a c at ?
It ' s re ally c ut e , show it to you my friend .
It ' s very hu m id to day no w in d s and want to do nothing
My s k in is st ic k y all over

To night is going to be a big night for J a p an
C a n ' t wait to watch , e i th ter ! !
I ' m look ing for w or d that .
I w or ri ed about ma k ing friend s .
I ' ll always smile to or r ow : )
E ver y th ing O K !
My p rofessor asked us to go to a f e w writing works h op s and she would give us ex t r a 5 point s for every works h op we go .
B e c us e I had another a p po in t ment finish ed at the same time when the works h op started .
R e c ent ly too bu s y , I have n t a di ar y . . . . . .
A f e w days , I have a t est .
And now I want every on e who can tea ch me e ng l ish .
I ' ll be can t on e se , I can tea ch other s speak can t on e se .
W at ch ing M o v i e T it led R E D
To day I watch ed a mo v i e , R E D act ed by B r u ce W i ll is .
I understood R E D as re d at first , but R E D stand s for R e t ir ed Even D an g er ous .
In other w or d , R E D re p re s ent s x - C I A a g ent s who are still da ng er ous .
The mo v ies act ed by B r u ce W i ll is never give dis a p po in t ment to me .
R E D was also very ex c it ing ,
When I was you ng , high te en age s , I like d ho r r or mo v ies .
As time go es by , I think person al ity has change d .
I w an n a tell the cha r a c t or c r u c i al thing .
There are many character s like I show ed as a b o ve : Ka r a age K un and character s for s te ame d me at bu n s , al th ough all of them are not a w ar e of their c ri t ical circumstance s .
I of ten sit in front of the comp ut er all day long , so there is a big pro ble m for my eyes .
There is a new pro d u c t K in d le which will probab ly so l ve my pro ble m .
You can hold it just like a re al b ook and the s c re en look s like the p age of a b ook too .
But it co st over $ 2 0 0 .
That is way too high .
As a ro ut in e op er ation , I sp ent s ever al hour s as a re ce p tion is t , and at mi d night , I looked around to see if something wrong had ha p en d .
On the S e c on d F l o or , it s ud d en ly got dark er than before !
When I a p p ro ch ed the op er at ing room , I heard
s c ar ed to he ar and I quick ly ra n away from the place .
But the voice came after me as if it would tell something im p or t ant to me .
The next day , I heard from some on e that the voice was that of a de ce as ed old lady who di ed from a ter m in al i ll .
A fter she had a op er ation , she qu i k ly di ed .
I c or re c t myself : probab ly I dr e a m every night but I think I have dr e ame d only when I re m e m b er the dr e a m .
I must say that many time s what I live in the dr e a m is con ne c ted with my re al life , with my w or ri es .
M a y b e I ' m not a person with a l ot of f ant as y !
I do n ' t believe so much in the in ter p re t ation of dr e a m s because nothing ex t re m e ly strange happen s . . . .
but , in the last one , first ly I dr e ame d I was in f la ting a bu n ch of b a ll o on s . .
then I re m e m b er I dr e ame d mi ce in my room .
When I got up next day I was in a da z e .
M ic e ? ? ? ?
In my room ? ? ?
It was the first time I dr e ame d about an im al s .
I made a sea r ch on go o g le and the mean ing was n ' t so po s it ive .
So , regard less of re l i g ion s , every on e is ha p p y to say `` M er ry C h ri st m as ! ``
When you us e water at a bath ro o m , do you turn a l ever from a f a u ce t to a show er ?
In J a p an , we usual ly s w it ch how to run water by turn ing a l ever .
And I may not usual ly us e a show er but a f a u ce t .
To was h hand s , face and so on .
On ly when tak ing in a show er , I us e the a p p l i ance .
B e c a us e of this , you will have a ter ri ble a c c id ent if you for g e t return ing the l ever after us ing a show er .
You must s ud d en ly take in a co l d show er at the n a pe of your ne c k un in ten tion ally .
It ' s enough to with er you over a day .
H a ve you ever had the a c c id ent ?
T en ex t r a hand s were very we l c ome . .
I ' m going to L on d on about 1 0 hour s d ur ing the school tri p s , y e a h !
And still , I have this e er y idea I for g ot about something . . .
My friend s go along with me .
O ur you th ho st el is sit u at ed two hour s ri d ing from L on d on , so I ' ll eat a l ot away in my b or ed o m .
And my be st friend is quite sen s it ive of s u g ar , in the sen se she get s re ally , re ally h y p er and g i g g ly .
Then she g i g g le s of very s il ly things . . .
E m i le R ate l b and is nothing comp ar ed to her f it of laugh ter s !
not e : E m i le R ate l b and is a very h y p er mo t i v ation train er , who always y e ll s ' ' T s j a k a ! ' ' .
X D I think he ' d dr ive me c r a z y when he talk s to me for five minute s .
So six c r a z y girl s po l ish ing off a l ot of s u g ar and ch o c o l ate is the per f e c t re c i pe to get in st it ch es , a co up le of girl s who are fool ing around and a l ot cha t ter , cha t ter and cha t ter !
This mean s I probab ly w o n ' t get a ch ance to than k you all for you commen t s , c or re ction s or s up p or t .
The last day in 2 0 0 9
To day is the last day in 2 0 0 9 but I still need to take the class while some of my friend s s k i p class es yesterday to go home and p re p ar e co un t down act i v it ies .
In T a i w an , when `` co un t down `` coming almost every co un t ies and c it ies will have big act i v it ies people will ga ther to watch s ing er s ' perform ance .
M o st f un part of co un t down must be f i re w or k perform ance .
A m on g all f i re w or k perform ance in T a i w an T A I P E I 1 0 1 is the most f a m ous one because T A I P E I 1 0 1 is high est bu il d ing in the world .
A fter co un t down f i re w or k perform ance will last 1 8 8 second s .
When in ve st ing the st ock mar ke t , we as s m u e that the c r ow d s would be at t r a c ted by the out st and ing comp an y as time go es by .
A m er ic an I d al , a T V pro g r a m , is an good ex amp le .
The good new s is the w is d o m of c r ow d s ex a c t ly ex is t s .
F or ex amp le , when est im at ing the number of the p in b a ll in a j ar or the m ur d er ra te in N e w Y or k c ity , the er r or s between the c r ow d s always be c ance ll ed out by each other so that the a ver age answer is of ten c or re c t s ur p ri s ly .
On the another side , the bad new s is the w is d o m of c r ow d s is the p h en ome n on which is too week to be believe d .
The di f f er ence between the s m ar t and the b l in d c r ow d s may b e just one p a ce .
The w or se thing is the con ne ction of mo d er n life may make s us become more difficult to get the be n if it from the w is d o m of the c r ow d s a ccord ing to the new re se ar ch show ed by some S w is s s c i ent is t s .
I watch ed hi ch school m us ic la at first , it ' s very interest ed and p ow er ful .
No w a day , I feel sleep y feel in day time f ri qu ent ry .
To day , I near ly sleep in m id st of work .
L a c k of sleep is bad affect on body , es pe c i ally on bra in .
My p ar ent s already di ed , so I live in my a un t ' s home now .
But I ' ll have to be back to my own home unti l I go to the U S A .
There is no one . . .
It will be short time , but I may feel l on e ly .
I had live d alone for s ever al year s .
But I feel different when I live alone in the house I was b or n .
It is s ty l ish for m and good de s i g n .
I ' m having difficult y when I us e it , however I take pleasure in us e it .
A success ful in law s u it against n ation and P h ar m a ce ut ical C o m p an y .
The p la in t if f ( p at i ent s ) is a success in this law s u it against n ation and p h r m a ce ut ical comp an y .
P e op le who work at p h ar m a ce ut ical in d ust ry , must be act ive in dis c l o s ing i nformation for me d ical s ta f f and p at i ent s .
My friend , who se pe t name is S un n y b o y , invite d me to str o ll around the street s with him yesterday 4 P M .
He want ed to sen d a girl who has been having c r us h on her a p ur se , which has a ex qu is ite f i g ur e i ll ust r at ed in world ma p .
I or d er ed the but ter and b a c on past a , as k ing the wait re s s if the c he f could get ri d of b a c on for me for I am a ve g e ta ri an .
F in ally , we came to a sp or t s play g r ound that has many in d o or sp or t am en it ies , includ ing b a se b a ll , b as ke t b a ll and so c c er .
He re in T a i w an , it ' s p re v al ent to play this in d o or b a se b a ll , it took only $ 1 U S .
The p it ch ing machi ne will p it ch es 3 0 b a ll s in turn , who se sp e ed can be ch o s en , and the play er s just take the b at to s w ing .
f m `` , but I have could n ' t write re c ent days .
One of the reason is that I do n ' t know my English is c or re c t or not .
If your di ar y written in J a p an e se , I can c he c k your J a p an e se ! !
My town has a l o c al free ma g a z in e `` E x p l or er `` .
It ' s very us e ful because it has an even t s ch ed ul e of my town and has some v o u ch er s of re st a ur ant s .
It ' s p u b l ish ed every month , and I find it in the sh op p ing ma ll , in re st a ur ant s and so on .
If you ' ll find the l o c al free ma g a z in e , you should get it .
I ' m not sure whether I would work at the c ur r ent comp an y , but the certain thing is that I would have the comp an y life unti l 4 5 year s old .
The be st would be mo v ing to other comp an y off er s better condition however I have f e w ch o ic es as a p ar ent who are tak ing care of an you ng ch il d .
The w or st thing make s me hard is that my p ar ent s live s so far so that they c a n ' t care my ch il d in s te ad of me .
C ur r ent ly I ' m hi r ing a b a b y s it ter to care of my ch il d at work , some time s I feel sorry not to care of her direct ly .
It would n ' t be possible to be ha p p y in front of her who c ri es as k ing me not to go work .
T h ough , the reason I de c id ed to con t in u e to work is for better future .
H o pe to have better house , e ar n more money , e qu i p my ch id with good education s , bu y what I want and go for a tri p . . .
I thought I did n ' t want big things however , it was n ' t tru e .
A t first , I started to le ar n English for ma k ing a better care er , but now a day s I just like saying what happen s around me in English because there are some on e who have w ar m conc er n s with kind c or re ction s .
E i ther in K or e an and in English , I always write things comp le x ly .
It would be hard time this week because I at ten d ed a re l at ive ' s w ed d ing so that I did n ' t take a re st last week en d .
I re ally want to have de e p re st for a day . .

I went to a school and me t my friend s .
A fter school I work ed at part time job .
le ar n English from M o v i e ?
it ' s been a long time I watch we s ter n mo v ies .
but is n ' t it too ex a g g er at ed when speak ing ?
I mean the w or d s , v o c a b ul ar y , way of speak ing in the mo v ies ,
they ' re ma k ing mo v i e , some time s they p re ten d to be more e m o tion al when act ing , includ ing speak ing .
if I le ar n English speak ing from mo v ies , is it a p p ro p ri ate ?
I ' m first year st ud ent on m aster ' s de g re e in S I T un ive r s ity .
I re se ar ch in the L a b from morning to even ing on a week day .

It is w ed d ing as s is t ant .

To day , I just sp ent my time for re st .
P ro b ably , I will go to S e o ul at sat ur day because one of my be st friend s who ' s b ir th day .

And next my s ch ed ul e will be change .
I just look for my go al .
C he er s for my life and I believe that = )
The old er we become , the short er we feel pass ing a year .
I think that the number of a year di v id ed our year s is di m in ish ing .
F or ex amp le , since I ' m 2 6 year s old , a year di v id ed my age is 1 / 2 6 .
On the other hand , one el d er ly person who is 8 0 year s old , a year di v id ed his age is 1 / 8 0 .
I think that the el d er ly person feel s short er a year than I in the a b o ve case .
To day I was very tired because I work ed long time .
I will ex er c is e a near by p ar k when I go back home .
I must many things .
I am hard to day .
It have been ra in ing to day .
I went to b ook st or e to bu y some b ook s .
I have interest ed in p ow er stone ^ ^
I c he c k ed my b ir th st on e and going to bu y my own p ow er stone .
What do you have interest ed in ?
I ' m more like ly to have a or al ul c er , and I have two or al ul c er s now .
The one is on my to n gue , the another is near the corner of my l ow er l i p .
When I begin to speak or eat ing something , I have a ter ri ble pai n there .
But I l o ve S pe a k ing and eat ing !
A ccord ing to w i k i p ed i a , p ic k y eat er , person under str es s or with a f o o d all er g y p r ed is po s ed to have a or al ul c er .
I ' m not so p ic k y eat er , and many people say that it see m s I hard ly feel str es s .
I s this course of the or al ul c er s ?
A n y way , I ho pe to get c ur ed soon er !
L on g long a g o there is a bo y l o ve you so long .
But with the s te p s of w in d all things have go ne .
How long I have to wait for see ing you again .
But in the end of f a ir y ta le you even t u ally said `` by e - by e `` .
My English ability is going to w or se and w or se .
When I want to talk in English , I will think of J a p an e se into un c on s c i ous ness .
It ' s so strange !
I have le ar n ed English since j un i or high school , but have le ar n ed J a p an e se just for two year s .
To C h in e se people , w or d s of J a p an e se are e as i er than English .
In addition , in the co ll e g e , my ma j or is J a p an e se .
I us e it every day , and in most class .
O ur teachers are str ic t .
I want to pro m o te my English ability .
M a y b e read ing an English ar t ic le every day ?
M or e ex a c t ly I say , I made my set of s n ow b or d ing bu y by my father as my b ir th day ` s present .
I went to Ka n d a , Tokyo with my far ther some days a g o .
There was a town of sp or t s good s and us ed b ook s .
M an y sp or t s comp an y bu il d ing s and a l ot of small sh op s .
It is No ve n ver and w in ter will soon come !
So many sh op s se ll s n ow b or d and s n ow b or d we ar .
We went in the sh op s and watch many b or d s .
I asked to a sh op man about which board is good f un ction for me and good on me .
My ta ll is 1 6 5 c m , so I should us e a b or d among 1 4 5 - 1 5 5 c m .
I went back one of sh op s .
I found my f a b or ite de s i g n .
I looked o po s ite side of b or d .
I of c ous e looked v l u e ta g .
A t last I found a good bo ad .
I took it .
When I said paper b ook s in U S were too ex p en s ive , my A m er ic an friend said to me `` tell me about it ``
I did n ' t think that mean s ex a c t ly .
But it mean s `` I agree with you `` `` I already know that , I think so ``
I came back to J a p an yesterday and I ' m in my p ar ent s ' house in O s a k a .
I ' ve not written my ent ri es since the past f e w days because I was n ' t able to us e In ter ne t in the hotel .
F ir st of all , we went to the L on e P in e K o al a S an c t u ar y .
We was able to see many f a m ous kind s of an im al s in A ust r al i a such as k o al as , k an g ar o o s , w o m b at s , and so on .
In particular , my d aught er re j o ic ed to fee d k an g ar o o s .
On the second day , we went to the M or e t on I s l and .
M or t on I s l and is the big g est is l and made of s and s in the w or l s so it has many de s er t s .
Besides , we enjoy ed s w im m ing in the sea , eat ing many kind s of dis he s which were p op ul ar in A ust r al i a .
What we will never for g e t in the future is that we was able to fee d the w il d do l p h in s direct ly .
Why the se people ro ot for C G ?
good m or n ing .
To day s my p l an is sh op p ing to right - on .
ma x im um : You need to pay ma x im um at ten tion w he you us e ga s o line .
mi n im um : I think his im m id i ate a ction kept the da m age mi n im um . ( just mi n im um see m s w i er d . . .
me re : I want to know the tru th , not just a me re fact .
e m p ty : When I visit ed her house , there was no one and the room was e m p ty .
va c ant : I could n ' t find a va c ant sea t when I took a train . ( took a train ? )
I was p l an n ing to take teaching J a p an e se in ten s ive class d ur ing s um m er .
So , if I could take the class , I would be going to get a c er t if ic ation as a J a p an e se teacher .
When I he ar about that , I was so so so so sh ock ed !
But , there ' s nothing I can do for that .
I have to wait the next ch ance or just for g e t about it or what else ?
I always think about my future but never find n ic e idea .
On each s ta ll s that called `` G o ten - Ya ta i `` , the girl s have on co l or ful co st um es are play ing m us ic called `` O ha y ash i `` .
They all are s ing ing `` Ka b u k i - B a y ash i `` same with the m us ic which s an g in `` Ka b u k i `` .
W ome n are sit ting at the back of the girl s and are play ing `` S ha m is en `` and `` H u - e `` f l ut es .
A ll of them on the s ta ll s are the w ome n and the girl s because `` G e ish a `` was play ing `` O ha y ash i `` on the s ta ll original ly since an c i ent time s .
Some of w ome n are re al `` G e ish a `` still now .
What a beautiful m us ic they play !
Why no body would help me to c or re c t my comp o s i tion ? ? M a y b e no body can understand what I w ro te ? M a y b e my comp o s i tion too b or ing ? What happen ed ? W h o can tell me ? When the first time to write it , I ' m so ex er c ting to look ing for w ar d some on e would help me .
But it ' s p ity that no one c or re c t my comp o s i tion .
The comp an y s u c ce ed ed in ma k ing a sp e c i al in k that dis a p pe ar s when it s te m p er a ture get s over a certain de g re e and appear s again when it is f ro z en .
So when you write with this p en , your hand w ri ting s look as if they are written with a b a ll point p en , but if you make a f ri ction , you can er a se as if it is written with a p en c il .
You can not us e it on the le g al do c u ment s but for da i ly us e it is very us e ful .
This p en was ch o s en as the to p ten good s of the year when it first appeared on the mar ke t .
I put the l in k be l ow .
M ate l to v !
Ka s i a is always s m il ling person .
V er y hot
I live in C h i b a .
It ' s very hot the se days .
I dr i p with s w e at without do ing anything .
The a ir condition er is ne ce s s ar y .
I ' m read ing a English paper about a d a p t ive sign al now .
It ' s difficult for me to read paper s .
But I want to study hard and ex p and my know led g e .
how to sleep quick ly
R e c ent ly it take s a long time to f a ll as le e p every night .
I go to be d at 1 : 0 0 A M , but I ' m a w a ke on the be d for about an hour .
So next day I feel sleep y or tired all day ,
D o you know how to sleep quick ly ? ?
My hu s b and ' s high school friend H or i - k un , my hu s b and , and I went to M an ly be a ch , which was near from C ir c ul ar Q u a y and it took about 3 0 minute s by f er ry .
Then I saw something b l u e like a th re ad in the water , and I thought it must be a fish er man ' s fish ing line .
So I was afraid that there might be a h ook at the end of that something like a fish ing line , and I thought that might hu r t us .
So I a v o id ed them .
When I not ed that j el ly f ish es an el d er lady spoke to me and she kind ly told me that there was a al er t of j el ly f ish es on that day .
I found I was st un g by j el ly f ish es not only one but many part s of my body .
It ' s already two week s after j el ly f ish es st un g me , but I still have s c ar s on my le g s .
S t i ll I am tra n s la ting my father ' s b ook in English .
L ate ly , a sp e c ies become ex t in c t because of act i v ity of hu man being .
E s pe c i ally the ha b it of an im al s , p l ant s and in se c t s are de st ro y ed .
The se fact or hi t a life di ver s ity .

I me t my la g u age ex change part n er to day .
She is same age as me and re ally good at J a p an e se .
It was impress ing and in s p ir ed me a l ot .
I us ed to speak J a p n a e se well but I c a n ' t now .
I re al i z e that how easy la g u age s are for g e t able .
K e e p study is hard but re ally is s ent i al
But my thought was change d after see ing them that this s er ies of the mo v i e is a story about A n a k in S k y w al k er , who is also D ar th V ad er .
The person who in f l u ence d me the most is my J a p an e se teacher .
In addition , he re c o m m en d s me to read many b ook s , not only J a p an e se litera ture but also for e i g un one .
I can b ro d en out l ook on my life .
No w I would like to be a teacher like him and also I am tak ing a teaching c or se .
F is t s , we have to dr in k at least 2 0 0 0 c c of water each day .
We can full of en er g y if we have a good b re a k f a st .
There ' s nothing better than ex er c is e to im p ro ve your he al th y , and make you feel better about your s el f .
H ar d work start
So I went to the c a f e .
I k i ke the ic e co f f e e .
B ro n d on did n ' t go back home this week en d , I took 4 students .
He could n ' t stay with his gr o up unti l before dinner .
And K ome change d the s ta f f as s i g n ment .
So My s ch ed ul e change d too .
B e c a us e She ' ll take G e or g e 3 day s .
F ir st , I do n ' t have p at i ence to sit still pe a ce ful ly and not to think the people who have made my life difficult .
I at e a s al ad as l un ch .
And I at e a co l d noodle as dinner .
I could n ' t wait the s un to ri se .
Then by 2 am , my hand s were sh ive r ing .
I could n ' t even draw a line straight ly .
I almost pass ed off .
I even t u ally got some me e t to eat , my body stop p ed feel ing co l d and stop p ed sha k ing .
M a y b e I was b or n as a c ar n i v or a .
I eat gr il led noodle for l un ch .
It ' s a very good ta s te .
But to day work is very bu s y .
To be honest , when I came back home from T e x as in the end of this M a y ,
my un ive r s ity was in the middle of se m est er , which mean s my school did n ' t let me re g is ter class es for this se m est er .
As long as my credit s for gradua tion conc er n ed , it ' s o k a y : - ) I ' ve already take n class es enough to gradua te , p l us I ' m go n n a go on to the 5 th year for job hu n ting .
T h in k ing about job hu n ting make s me feel a ng s ty . ) No w I ' m work ing for s um m er in ter n s h i p , I ' m not sure whether I can be an in ter n for some comp an y though ( B e c a us e it ' s serious ly comp e t it ive and the ch ance s of me get ting into a comp an y are re ally l ow .
As for the comp an y I a p p l i ed for , it was like there were more than 1 0 0 0 a p p l ic ant s while only 4 or 5 people were hi r ed . ) M an y of my friend s talk re l u c t ant ly and c ry p t ic ally about what ' s going on with their s um m er in ter n s h i p s .
I try not to get my wish high but I ' ll do my be st : - ) I ' m go n n a take an in ter v i e w with a comp an y I re ally w an n a work for this s um m er .

M an y J a p an e se comp an ies , es pe c i ally ex p or ter s , their business re s ul t s for last ter m were ex t re m e ly bad .
That of my comp an y was the same as that and I am not certain whether it can s ur v ive the next g en er ation .
But it will have re a ch ed the limit s in next year .
M an ch est er United is the big f o ot b a ll c l u b in E ng l and .
That ' s my f a v o ite tea m .
S in ce he j o in ed M an U , he de d ic at ed the tea m .
He left the tea m because he con f l ic ted with Sir A le x who is the co a ch of M an U .
I ho pe R o on e y would not go same way .

And I was request ed to study English and J a p an e se at English v i ll age on the de ce m b er 2 3 .
So I have been study ing j a p an e se and English s te p by s te p , and F in ally I ' ll have im p ro v ed language ability about English and j a p an e se .

But I have f e w to p ic s and my e ng l ish is poor , there f or e it is so difficult for me to keep ing a da ir y here .
But , of course I c a n ' t give up it already .
I ' m always surprise d by people here with keep ing th i er j o ur n al in a for e i g n language .
I el n v y them .
Y e a h , I know it ' s mean ing less .

To day , I went to In ter n ation al mar ke t , the l i b r ar y and the s up er m ar ke t .
The s un light is get ting more strong and more strong so I was we ar ing a ha t with big b ri m .
O h I want to go to H a w a i i again .
The w in d turn ed over the b ri m and I got a l ot of s un light . . .
I have a b ook I had to return so I went to the l i b r ar y .
The l i b r ar y would be c l s ed at 6 : 0 0 .
I ha ng out with my friend s yesterday .
When we me t , we did n t know where the `` bu d a e z z i g a e `` re st a ur ent was .
So we walk ed to look for the re st a ur ent for an hour .
We found the re st a ur ent in the end .
But I s u f f er d my friend s by walk ing for an hour .
It ' ll help us s a ve our time .
I l o ve to see many for e i g n er friend s .
H o pe to C o m m un ic ate with them and have a ha p p y time with them !
Some day , I stay in A ust r al i a in the future .
It s my dr e a m .
On a co u ch
I ' m listen ing to my favor ite m us ic now .
No w play ing is `` C ome back home : by T w o do or c in e m a c l u b ``
T im e for re la x ation . . . . .
What do you usual ly do for re la x ing ?
I usual ly read a fashion ma g a z in e over listen to m us ic .
That ' s my favor ite time .
To m or r ow will be F ri day !
I want to the sea , to re la x from work . . . .
I see it in front of my eyes all day . . .
There is the my so n ' s school f est i v al yesterday .
My w if e took part of a mi n i - c ar ra c ing game .
While she was do ing that , the other of my family had a l un ch .
My A m er ic an friend started his m us ic b l o g !
A c t u ally he is a J a p an e se le ar n er , and we have been do ing language ex change s for one and a half year s every day over S k y pe .
I re ally think that keep ing a b l o g in our le ar n ing language is a great idea because we can us e the language da i ly .
In my case , I l o ve receiv ing a commen t from some on e because it always en c o ur age s me and mo t i v ate s me up for keep ing b l o g s in English .
So , to an no un c ing his b l o g , I have l in k ed his m us ic b l o g to two of my b l o g s to day .
I also in t ro d u c ed his b l o g to some J a p an e se so c i al ne t w or k s er v ic e sit es that I have been us ing like mi x i .
I po st ed his b l o g ' s U R L in my J a p an e se b l o g and on the wall of my F a ce b ook .
I ho pe his b l o g will become world f a m ous , and he will be able to get many In ter n ation al follow er s .
A fter we gradua ted our school , we had a long b re a k and we f in ally started keep ing in to u ch last year .
I think she almost change d my life because I do n ' t think I would have been the same me without the per i o d .
she was living at her bo y f ri en d ' s mo m ' s house with him and his p ar ent s .
In my opinion , He r bo y f ri en d seemed like a person who dis c o ur age s her by i g n or ing her .
I am pretty sure having that kind of bo y f ri en d for over se ve n year s affect ed her person al ity little by little .
I do n ' t know when my dr e a m come s tru e .
I c a g h t a co l d
3 day a g o I had a so re th ro at . . .
To day I have a run n y no se , head a ch e , and a bad c ough .
That ' s s y m p t on of co l d .
I c a g h t a co l d to day : (
When we see an object , we do it by accept ing light re f le c ted from the object .
S in ce light has a f in ite sp e ed , there is a de la y in this pro ce s s .
The C M B is not only a me s se ng er who has en or m ous i nformation of the e ar ly un ive r se , but also an im p or t ant c l u e to answer the es s ent i al question s since the begin n ing of hu man history , like `` what is the sha pe of the un ive r se ? `` , `` what is the future of the un ive r se ? `` .
My re se ar ch is a im ed at g i v ing a more a c c ur ate an a ly s is of the C M B , by ex a m in ing the in ter a ction between the p la s m a in c l ust er s of ga la x ies and the C M B .
I believe that it is one of the most im p or t ant v o c ation s for us that ex p l or ing the un ive r se - the place where we all live .
No body can know that .
F or this reason , we should make effort s to ful f i ll our dr e a m s or wish es .
What do you see your s el f in five year s ?
I ' d like to study over se as to m aster English again and I need to le ar n some me th o d s to make my less on s at t r a c t ive and enjoy able .
In addition , I need to know much about c ul t ur al di f f er ence s between J a p an and other co un t ri es because I believe that I should not only tea ch English but also let my students feel some c ul t ur al di f f er ence s in English class .
As my d aught er is now e i g h t year s old , she will have gradua ted from e le ment ar y school and she will be going to j un i or high school five year s from now .
I ho pe to keep a good re l ation s h i p with her .
Yes ter day night , I was p l an ing to go to a live of a m us ic i an , who are one of the most ma j or in J a p an .
The ir name is M r .
I do n ' t know why they have this name ( and I ' m sure they are re al ch il d re n , that is they are all over thirty year s old .
A c t u ally , I have never part ic i p at ed to a live of m us ic , that is said to be f a b ul ous .
Some of my friend s have enjoy ed a conc er t of some m us ic i an s and they all say s they enjoy ed so o o o o o o o much , when ever I he ar say in like those , I en v i ed them so much .
T h us , I thought this year I would like to , or I must j o in a live conc er t !
A t the same time , I thought if I am both er ed to j o in it , I will j o in the one , that is most p op ul ar !
However , there are some difficult ies we have to over c ome .
F ir st , get ting ti c ke t s for it is so difficult for us , because so many people e age r to j o in their conc er t .
They are so p op ul ar in J a p an .
And another pro ble m is the ter m of ex a m of my part n er may f a ll on to the same ter m of the conc er t , but we are not sure yet .
There are some sit u ation s that we should n ' t us e mo b i le .
F or ex amp le they are in the class , in the meeting in the job .
It is de b ate right now , too .
They are not case only for a d ul t s .
E ver y on e need s to j ud g e whether it ' s c or re c t to us e mo b i le in the each sit u ation s .
So even if to b r ing ce ll p h on e was b an n ed in the school ,
it would n ' t be good for get ting ability to j ud g e them .
C h il d re n should le ar n manner s since when they were you ng .
I find that I ' ve work ed for 2 7 days without ho l i day !
I ' ll go to T ur ke y for 9 days start s from tomorrow .
It ' ll be great if some body has anything T ur ke y new s for me !
As you know , J F A name d A l b er t o Z a c ch er on i as the new co a ch of J a p an e se n ation al f o ot b a ll s qu ad , however , he could n ' t be in this game because of not get ting v is a .
It was the first time in 1 0 year s to see the n ation al tea m ' s act u al ma t ch .
A bout 66 0 0 0 people were ga ther ed at the st ad i um , which is the ma x im um c a p ability of the st ad i um .
What is good new s for me is 7 of the start ing me m b er play es over se as .
Ka g a w a who play s in B or s s i a D or tm un d ( G er man y ) got the go al .
It was be a ut ful go al .
n at ive speak er s ;
The even t of the con se c t ive ho ll i day s for about 1 0 days was over .
In the per i o d we sp ent l ot s of money dis or d er ly , which we had not

C on se qu ent ly , we have a hard time e c on o m ical y sp en d ing

I c l ic k another ta b on my b r ow s er and give a g l ance to la ng - 8 .
C or re c ting or commen ting to some on e ' s di ar y make s me a w a k en .
L an g - 8 is a kind of re st or at ive for me : )
I ' m j un i or high school st ud ent .
B y the way , I l o ve J a p an e se dr a m .
J a p an e se dr a m is `` T A I K O `` in J a p an .

I want ed to re p ly to the all .
So I will write me s s age t o this week .
G in z a is the J a p an ' s most ex p en s ive re al est ate .
R e c ent ly , the world ' s bra n d sh op s ( es pe c i ally reason able bra n d s ) has open ed in G in z a . ( L i ke H & M , A b er c ro m b i e & F it ch , U n i q ro , G a p , F or ever 2 1 and so on . ) So G in z a became easy to a p p ro a ch for or d in ar y c it i z en s .
Yes ter day , I went to see my da d to K o b e .

I did n ' t have enough time to take p ic s , but I found some through in ter ne t .
H a ha , I ' ve no idea , but I can gue s s the own er of that bu il d ing w o n ' t se ll h is re al est ate and ro ad con st r u c t or s had no ch o ic e to way out .
On sat ur day , I had a le c ture about p re v ent ive me d ic in e .
So people have more interest in what they eat in The U S A .
The go ver ment im po s ed a tax on c ar b on at ed dr in k ( like a co ke ) , and every f o o d s have in d ic ation for n ut ri tion , es pe c i ally for tra n s - f at .
T r an s - f at is very ha r m ful to your he al th , but many of j un k f o o d s , like a ha m b ur g er , f ri ed p ot at o s , p i z z a , con tain tra n s - f at .
But J a p an e se f o o d , like a s us h i , s ash im i con tain s less tra n s - f at , So re c ent ly J a p an e se f o o d is very p op ul ar in The U S A .
I s it sure ?
