A family , seemingly a father , a mother and two of their children , get in a car .
Funky music starts , playing some bad obscenities .
It seems they do n't care so much about its lyrics and ride on to the rhythm .
This commercial film is really reflecting what happens to English learners .
Characters of the seasons are completely different from each other in Japan .
In spring , we can see not only plums and cherry blossoms , but also a trailing mist across mountains which is a crowning beauty in the morning .
In summer , if you go to the countryside , many fireflies will welcome you .
It must be a fantastic scene .
In autumn , especialy late autmn , when you look at the reeds flashing ( ? ) golden and the leaves turning red or yellow , you will surely feel happy , as if you were dreaming .
In winter , silent snow indicates great intelligence ( / wisdom ) which man can not have .
In response to the question as to which season I like , it must be the time of seasonal change .
I miss passing seasons with affection , while I admire coming seasons .
Japanese value evanescence .
The beauty of the cherry blossom is not so much in its appearance , but its evanescence .
The life of a firefly is very short .
I wanna learn Japanese but I 'm so busy and I ca n't type Japanese on this PC in the coming weeks .
I like it here , so does Kichan
It tasted very good ! !
It takes two hours to commute to work to and fro .
I take a subway to work and change trains twice .
I study my English books in the train .
Usually , we use them only when we go far away .
Today I needed to go to the post office to pick up a letter from Japan .
I used a highway just to go to the post office .
I think my Japanese friends would never believe this .
Japan won against Argentina ! I 'm so excited !
But I could n't see the game .
Do you know about MANGA cafes ?
Does anyone know about Manga cafes ?
A Manga cafe is where you can read many many Manga .
In the Manga cafes they give us separate rooms .
Their prices are low so many generations can use them .
If you come to Japan and your are good at Japanese , I suggest going a Manga cafe .
By the way , Manga cafes have many different surroundings .
They have good surroundings .
In IKEBUKURO , KITITYOUZI , SIBUYA have good one . ( ? )
Thank you for reading ^ ^
It is the first time I 've [ I have ] come here .
Hello ! !
Yesterday , I went drinking with my friends from when I was college student .
One of them is working for a Japanese automaker .
Sometimes he goes around the world .
enjot it ! I 'm enjoying it !
I decided to read aloud using the AFN book .
The first section was the inaugural address of Barack Obama as the nation 's 44th president .
Usually I carry my I - pod to listen to some music and English programs .
Today I found out a new thing about English .
The sentence is ( space ) `` I can not thank you enough ``
I felt this sentence sounded like that person is n't grateful .
Yeah I learned today one thing today .
I put a fish , which was his favourite food , on his grave .
I can think of nothing , because I am tired now , or just pretending to be tired now .
What I am doing now looks like nothing , but it 's ( ? ) coming from nowhere , or it is just that I have to think more to find out what is needed .
I have trouble with my studies , livelihood and my girlfriend ( who may leave soon )
I went to a cafe near my school to read books and I walked for a long time .
Honestly I need to challenge my German .
But it does n't mean that I 'm giving up .
There are a lot of students from various countries .
England , Italy , Austria , Slovakia , Serbia etc .
Since this was my first time meeting Slovakian and Serbian people ,
Almost all conversation was in English , but I would have to say I had much difficulty communicating with them .
My communication skill in English is not good enough , particularly for listening .
In addition to that , everybody had a different accent in English including me .
So they tried to memorize it by associating it with `` Hiroshima ( Japanese city ) ``
It sounds funny , I never hit upon such an idea .
But I think Hiroshi is easier than Hiroshima , because it 's shorter , is n't it ?
Nice to meet u ~ ~ I 'm a freshman here ~ ~ I was born in Chengdu , China .
I hope I can make friends with you ~ ~
I hope everyone has a nice day ~ ~
Thank you ~ ~ ~ ~
When I happend to walk by the front of a kimono shop , a cute young clerk wearing kimono talked to me whilst smiling .
Some pretty girls wearing kimono were in Kyoto or Universal Studio Japan in Osaka on the pictures .
We talked about kimonos and things for a long time .
The clerk said , `` If you have time , why do n't you try this on ? ``
Of corse I tried it .
I had enough time and I do n't have any kimonos instead of yukata .
The kimono which I tried on was really beautiful .
I was satisfied with trying it on and had fun talking with the clerk .
But Kimono 's are very expensive , I ca n't afford to buy it now .
It seems that today will be a really nice day .
There are n't any clouds in the sky . The sun is shining and there is no wind .
Also , it is3 degrees Celsius , but it isonly11 a . m . Today I 'm going to play basketball in the skate park .
By the way , in the NBA , theOklahoma City Thunders wonversus L .
Lakers and arenow 2 - 2 in theseries .
m EST time , Cleveland will play versus Chicago .
I hope theCavaliers will win .
It like the spring had come already here in Chubu area , the center of Japan .
This is a quick digression , and the headquarters of hot TOYOTA is here .
And yesterday was my pay day , so I withdrew some money from ATM .
But it took me no less than 100 yen to withdraw some money as it was on saturday .
you see , just to withdraw money !
The banks are so budget - minded . Why should I pay money to withdraw my money ?
What do you think about it ?
Though I make fuss over it , I take out my money on weekends .
By the way , I walked to the convience store on foot since it 's so close .
I could see many spring flowers out there , and I was able to feel spring is actually around the corner .
I looked up other words to mean warm and found `` as snug as a bug in a rug `` .
I found it isvery interesting .
My name is Phyten !
I am a student in Hitotsubashi University , and my major is economics .
( Here is a list of my hobbies . . . )
Playing guitar , reading books ( especially on business and finance ) , playing badminton , surfing the Internet , programming , and talking ( chatting ) with my friends !
Also we can play with our neighbors . Not only we can make good friends but also we can spend quality time together .
Maybe I guess there is a saying , `` There will be fortunes to people who do nice things for their neighbors . `` .
If we share the foods to our neighbors when they are becoming poor , then we can get some food from them when they become okay and I become poor .
Next , we should act in a polite and positive manner towards our neighbors .
Neighbors are the part of our life and society , and all people like the neighbors who are very nice .
We should be friendly , helpful , and act in a suitable manner if we want to become a nice neighbors .
I 've finished my work .
I fixed some program code .
On this line ' Ninja ' trains - trains withninjas ' facespainted on - run every day .
But the train I 'm taking is not a ' Ninja ' train .
It does n't mean I got lost but that I lost my bank card .
Till recently , I was always absent - minded for some reason .
I kept thinking about things while walking on the road or siting in the train .
After I found out that the card was not in the right place .
I emptied my bag and anxiously checked it 3 ( three ) times . with .
But I still could n't find it .
Then , I called my family to let them . report the loss to the bank immediately .
I ca n't do that any more .
But what can I do ?
I just got home , recently I 've been getting back home late because of my job .
I really want to say thank you to everyone who corrected my mistakes and sent me a message .
I am now exchange student in America , and this is the first time I have ever lived without my family , so my parents worried a lot when I said goodbye to them at the airport .
But I reassured them by saying that I would send emails .
At first glance , my roommate actually left a very good impression on me because she was 5 years older than me , which made me feel she would support me in so many ways .
When I arrived at my room , she was with her Japanese boyfriend , so she introduced him to me and told me that if I had any Japanese questions , I could just ask her boyfriend .
I felt that I was so lucky that God gave me such a nice roommate , because she seemed to be very protective .
For a girl who had left home for the first time , it really helped a lot ! !
At least , she gave a made me feel secure , though her boyfriend always stayed in our room even at the bed time .
To let my roommate know that I would not be a threat to her relationship , I only brought up my questions when she was there as well .
Therefore , she hoped that I could turn to other Japanese for help instead .
As a result , I wrote a note to her , apologized and made it clear that I did not mean to upset her .
If she felt hurt , I would stop doing it right away ! !
Even though her boyfriend told me that he felt his girlfriend was too emotional and that I could still consult him questions when she was away , I declined his kindness and hardly spoke to him .
Originally I thought that everything would just go back to normal , to the very beginning when I was on good terms with her .
However I was totally wrong because now she only gives me the cold shoulder .
Last time , I fuzzed every time as speaking more than usual .
Sounds ironic , does n't it ?
What I mean is the more I study about expressions or vocabularies , the more I 'm confused , because everytime I try to use new things , it does n't come to my mind as automatically as I wish , and it makes me murmur ( ? ) .
It 's because I have a school trip on September 7 - 9 .
Although I live in Fukushima in Japan , I 'll be going to Tokyo in Japan . ( Future Tense )
So I need to be ready for my school trip soon .
I 'll write about my school trip when I get back home .
This leads to nowhere .
I want to try myself against the material world .
Our turn is at 14 : 25 .
I 'm going to my university , and starting choir practice from now on .
I live in a dorm with an international student from the U .
She is very good at Japanese and always helps me study English .
However , because she speaks Japanese so well , I sometimes hesitate to speak English .
Moreover , she always speaks Japanese instead of using English , so I do n't have enough chances to speak English .
Therefore , I try to decide `` ONLY ENGLISH DAY `` and I ask her to speak only English during that day !
I 'd go back in time , if I could : (
Annzu was a stray cat and was pecked by crows in a park , before a volunteer saved her life .
When she came to my house for the first time , she was so skinny that we could n't hug her tightly .
Today , I begin lang - 8
I 've been studying English since I was a junior high school student .
I can understand wrriten Emglish , for example news papers ,
but I ca n't listen and write English .
The class consists of students and teachers .
I had to speak many times , so it was profitable .
Gossip Girl is a popular American TV series that was introduced to China as a fashion and life style book .
In the shows , Serana and Blair are the most lucky girls who are rich , beautiful , charming , and so on .
They possess all the things which was most girls want to have in the world over all .
The people in the upper east live in a gorgeous and lavish area , plus they are elite who know how to managemultinational corporations even though maybe inherited them from family .
Obviously , they are in the spotlight in any parties at New York they go to at night .
We are mortal , directly I envy that kind of bule ( ? ) blood people .
Let me cite a fashionable word `` hold `` which is fantasy of an amazing girl in China .
I want to go to NY someday .
One of the serious problems in Japan .
I watched a TV news broadcast which was about the high numbers of suicide among younger people around 20 to 30 years old .
The news said that the numbers have continue to increase over the last 10 years .
I think that most younger people in Japan have no dreams or purpose for the future .
Then they feel themselves as useless to the world and that they have no reason to live anymore .
Anyway , presently , we are much richer materially than we have been in past , but our minds have weakened .
And Japanese society is in aging society . We are running out of younger people in the work force .
Somehow we must stop younger people from committing suicide , or our society will collapse much sooner than we expected .
I went to Oita , my home town , for about three weeks for summer vacation , and I came back home three days ago .
I felt a fresh appreciation of my parents this time because of going back to my home town .
I also realized how I had always had a luxurious life .
I did n't feel lonely before I went back to Oita , but still if I go back once , I will get accustomed to my old life with dogs , a sister and parents , so when I am alone again , I will feel very lonely .
But in fact , I 'm know that it is too bad for me because I 'm going abroad to America for four years as a university studdent .
None of my friends lives near my house , so whenever I go shopping , I am alone .
It is only a matter of time now before I start my class ( again ) , so I 'm looking forward to seeing my friends now .
This happened a few months ago .
I was on the platform , waiting for a train , as usual .
She seemed to be over 50 years - old , and came near to
where I was standing , because there was public phone near me .
She put money into phone , then dialed .
`` Oh , I 'm sorry I 'm going to be late . `` the woman said in a loud voice that
She continued talking .
`` I was having a poo . ( lol . . )
It was really big one so it took a long time to flush . ``
That 's why I missed the train .
I 'm sorry I ca n't be there on time , but it could n't be flushed ``
She desperately explained that it was n't her fault , but her poos fault .
Sometimes people make excuses for their mistakes , such as tardiness
However , I have never heard such a childish excuse .
Otherwise , nobody will believe her .
Everyday , going to the office , I watch a video on my iPod touch .
Recently I 've been watching `` Sesame Street ``
for the purpose of studying English .
`` Sesame street `` is fun for me .
But it 's exciting story tires me sometimes .
The word ' excitement ' means `` Hi - tensyon `` -
Maybe it is bad English .
`` sesame street `` is useful for studying english .
about `` less exciting `` English studying videos .
I had a dream that I drove a car and it fell off from the road .
I had to lie down before I checked the e - mail yesterday .
So , maybe I think I might have an allergy to pollen .
In spring I get dry skin and my eyes become very itchy . . .
Studying English
Hello , everyone .
My name is KAORI and I live in Japan Osaka .
I had studied English while I was a student , but I ca n't understand English now .
This trauma is very heavy to me .
So , I decided to start studying English at this site .
Please teach me the correct English .
So recently I have not updated my diary .
I work in a trading company .
We receive telephone calls from abroad , take care of foreign customer who visits Japan , go on business trips to do research at various conferences and exhibitions .
I believe someday I will improve my English if I keep on studying and updating ( my diary on ) this website .
Wow . . what a good website this is !
This is my first time writing here .
I want to meet many people from other countries !
I 'm very interested in classical guitar , but I ca n't play well .
After I graduate from college , I would play the guitar freely ! !
Tonight the World cup Japan vs Paraguay game is on !
I want to support the Japanese team , but I have to go to my part - time job . . . .
DVD shop have many dvds : 24 , prison brake , ugly betty , gossip girl , fringe , and so on . . .
What is your recommendation ?
The Japanese government warned people that there was a possibility of electric power failure in the Kanto region yesterday afternoon .
Tokyo power company had already stopped their service in the scheduled area
but they said there was still not enough power .
I filled plastic bottles , pots and buckets with as much water as possible .
We ca n't use water if we have a power failure .
My apartment is serving water to each family with electric power .
Fortunately , we avoided the crisis , although all the ATMs temporarily did n't work at one major Japanese bank .
The Fall approaches .
It was rainning day . It was raining today
The weather in Korea is a little cold due to the change of seasons .
For that reason , I thought about a lot of things .
So , now I 'm mentally overloaded .
I should do something fun !
Yesterday , I hung out to relax .
I walked from Shibuya to Harajuku and returned to Shibuya .
It was a nice weather , so I felt well .
It was a happy day , because I went to a spot I never go .
I forgot what I wanted to write about today .
My cellphone was n't working well .
I thought my cellphone finally broke down , because it did n't react even after I pressed the buttons .
I almost lost my composure .
I noticed that my friend 's cellphone is the same type as mine .
He was studying , but I broke in because I did n't afford to care for him .
He told me some information about the cellphone and suggested that I call customer service .
After he had finished his story , I tried to call customer service .
The moment I called to the customer center , I noticed that I was using my cellphone and it was working as usual .
I think it is because of my aging .
Every time I write an essay , I use a lot of the same transitional words .
If you know a variety of transitional words , could you please let me know ?
I have had lots of work to do , but I need to keep my learning time somehow .
It 's difficult for me to do two things at the same time .
But I 'll try hard , hoping that I can keep up at least once a week .
I want to be an international translation volunteer .
So maybe I should practice English often , hoping that Lang - 8 will help .
Outside was too hot , so I went home early and stayed in the living room .
The reason why is that the living room is the only room that has an air conditioner .
I live in Saint Petersburg near the metro station `` Ploshad Mygestva `` .
This station is not situated in the center of the city , but I very often go to the center to walk on the beautiful streets .
Many of St Petersburg 's streets still have some special historical features .
Little courtyards , narrow streets and buildings from the 19th century surround you and can immerse you in this fantastic time .
And a lot of cars , shops and coffee houses ca n't break this illusion .
You can walk in this city for many days and every day you will discover some new details of this atmosphere for youself .
Many times I just walk on `` Nevsky prospect `` and go to Aleksander Nevsky square .
Sometimes when I 'm not in a hurry , I just turn right or left at random crossroads and aimlessly walk around the little streets to feel the unique atmosphere .
If you are ever in Saint Petersburg and you have a lot of free time , I advise you to just walk around the city for one or two hours without any plan , and you will feel the unique atmosphere of the 19th century .
I was surprised at / by how big they were .
I thought that these cucumbers were more than twice as large as ones in Japan .
I recognized that even the same vegetables can have / be different shapes .
I began using Lang - 8 today .
I 'm not good at English , therefore I think that I should write short sentences every day .
This is my first time writing a diary .
I 'm Japanese . I 'm 21 years old .
My name means cherry blossoms , which is the most popular flower in japan .
I live in Kanagawa prefecture which is near Tokyo .
I 'm learning about ' Environment and Humanity ' in my University .
My hobbies are dancing , listening to hip - hop music and going to museums .
In March I 'm going to go to Colorado State University in the USA .
If you find any errors , please correct them .
My year end result will come out this Thursday .
I feel pretty anxious waiting for this day .
I hope to pass with flying colours !
Even though I try to write short entries , I regret that nobody corrected yesterday 's entry . . .
You do you think I should do to get corrections ?
Please give me some advice on how to get more corrections .
Would you please correct the entry I made yesterday ?
Yesterday I went to a hot spring and the bookstore .
The hot spring was very good .
At the bookstore I bought a textbook on English proficiency .
Someday I want to be proficient in English .
I went to school before going to the hot springs and book store .
It was to meet with fellow teachers .
I made cheesecake and delivered it to the fellow who had to work .
( * The second picture is a view of the nearby hot springs . )
Math is a very important subject in Korea .
If you give up on this subject , you give up on college .
But I am really poor in math .
I ca n't understand ( it ) at all .
Whenever I try to solve a question , I just get stuck .
How I can get better at math ?
so I decided to send a present for her today !
She likes to eat Japanese snacks so I decided to send her a plenty of Japanese snacks .
Most of it are rice crackers in different tastes .
I can not see the end of the tunnel .
I can not go back , and all I can do is to go forward while touching the wall of the tunnel .
I sometimes experience fear , depression and loneliness , but I have to conquer them if I want to become a fluent English speaker .
I almost lose my confidence of whether I can do it or not . . . . . .
It was too cold to use my room today .
The heater in my room is not warm enough , so I decided using my laptop in my living room .
According to the weather news , this cold weather will last until tomorrow .
I wonder if I 'll use my room tomorrow .
I do n't like to go out during a long holiday , everywhere is crowded with car and people .
It 's not easy to go for a few meters in a traffic jam .
Most of Chiang Mai residents will stay at home for celebration with families , while the visitors from around the world choose to countdown on the street .
Have you seen any accidents on the street in this season ?
After the celebrations finish , the drunken drivers need to go back home , but they always lost their control in driving .
During this festival we wish there was less disaster or loss .
The police station has a service to provide a cup of coffee or a foot massage for a long distance driver .
We have only a small hope that there will be less loss than last year .
Our long holiday lasts from 31st Dec 2009 to 3rd Jan 2010 including the beginning and finishing day . It 's six days in total .
Lately , I spend a lot of my time on the computer .
The reason is that it is on my table .
When I start using the computer I go mad with the internet .
But I cure that now using this program :
This program shows how much time you spend using the computer
So since I 've started using this program , my computer time has gone down
It 's really summer , is n't it ?
It 's . luxurious !
It 's reminiscent of a taste during my childhood in my hometown .
When I close my eyes , I can see myself eating corn , sitting outside in front of my house .
All of the doors and windows are open , because there is no air [ space ] conditioner .
In my hometown , there is a very beautiful river .
Sometimes we went to the river with cucumbers , tomatoes , some cheap melons and occasionally watermelons .
It was the most enjoyable time for us students .
I still remember the cucumbers and tomatoes , withjust a little salt on them . They tasted very good !
But please do n't ask me what I ate for dinner yesterday .
I had a pre - speech contest today .
Unfortunately I did n't make it to the final because I made a fluff .
I was also told by a teacher that I made a fluff because I did n't speak from my heart .
That was a blow to me .
I know this is kind of a small matter but it was very , very regrettable anyway ! !
Please give me your advice .
At this class , lots of people were American teachers .
After that , I draw a picture about trees .
At that , we sung a lot of Beatles ' songs .
It was delicious but , I was still hungry .
Then , I sung a song called `` Under the Sea . ``
I could n't sung very good because my voice was so high .
Today was really full of fun , because we did a lot of things .
And I 'm interested in Fuel Cell research and the Internet .
There are n't any stimulating things at the University .
Working or studying energy and environmental technologies including Fuel Cell research in graduate school .
Repairing a Computer
Recently , There were some problems with my computer ,
When I turned my computer on , the screen was blank
Finally , my computer started to work again .
I 'm going to take the TOEIC ( exam ) this weekend .
I missed it in January since I got the flu the day before the test .
Therefore I 'm glad to be able to take it this time .
I wonder if my English vocabulary has been improving during this period .
I had my hair cut today because summer is coming soon .
The length of my hair is pretty short now , compared to before .
I feel so good .
Today , I went to the ( / my ) office by car .
I ride on a train as usual .
But , it was really hot and humide today .
I did n't want to walk for a long time .
I like driving ( my car ) !
But , my car is getting worse because it is so old .
the window 's sensor and it 's very noisy .
I think I 'd better buy a new car .
But , I do n't have enough money : ( .

I went to various parts of Japan .
I want to go on a tour of Europe sometime in the future .
Today , my mom told me that in a high school in my hometown , there was a student suicide .
Swimming is difficult for me although I live inSoutheast China , a place rich in rivers and lakes .
During this summer vacation , I decided to learn it .
I have already had two swimming classes from which I have learned some basic swimming skills . With more and more practice , I have fallen in love with it . It can keep me fit . What 's more , it 's also a good way to relax .
Do you love swimming ? Can you share your swimming experience with me ?

Soon the snow turned into snow storm .
When I pushed the break pedal , the car did n't stopp .
At the time , the ABS worked and the car stopped
We arrived at the museum only to find that a reservation was necessary .
Actually , needing a reservation is unusual in Korea .

A Day Spent Waiting
Today , I wasted a lot of time waiting .
I waited the entire morning for my company 's car to help me deliver a shelf to my customer and also waited for my customer to put the shelf in the supermarket the whole afternoon .
What a boring day this was !
but I need to wake up now , because the sun is already high . . . ? ?
and also its Sunday today , , I need to go to the Church maybe later , , and later too at 3 pm . .
I am going to the B - day Party of my grade school classmates its her daughter 1st b - day , , and also its been a long time since I saw her , . .
its 9 : 30 in the morning here , , instead of taking milk and breakfast first , , I opened first my computer hahaha . . . word order
These are serious problems .
In Hong Kong , the government focuses on the drug problem .
Also , Many social workers are concerned about the family and violence problems .
However , there are no programs to deal with young people 's sexual behaviour .
But why has this issue in recent years been even more serious ?
The researchers note that `` If women are exposed to abuse , domestic violence , and family strife , it has enduring effects . ``
Also there are many cases which teenagers give up their babies in the street or have an abortion .
The most important thing is , they do not think they are wrong .
She wrote a diary and posted her pregnancy photos on the Internet .
She was proud of her pregnancy .
We have three kinds of solutions to solve the teenage pregnancy problem .
The second one is non - government and social workers . The last one is consulting with other countries ' policies .
Firstly , government should invest more in sex education .
Also , teenagers feel embarrassed communicating with their teachers and parents .
Their peer group also affects them .
For example , their peer group may give them the wrong messages regarding & nbsp ; sex .
Teenagers may misunderstand issues regarding sex when they receive incorrect information from their & nbsp ; peer group .
They are curious about sex and want to try it .
Sex education reduces the rate of teenage pregnancy .
Teachers can take care of teenagers when teaching them safe sex .
Also , it can reduce their curiosity and let them learn the the correct values .
Moreover , mass media gives unsuitable messages to young people . For example , Mother at 14 ( television drama ) , My Guardian Characters ( children 's comic book ) , and Juno ( Film ) provide & nbsp ; negative messages .
They may think teenage pregnancy is a universal phenomenon and part of & nbsp ; Western culture , or that & nbsp ; it is not a problem and not special .
Also , it can be perceived as a trend to follow .
So , the Hong Kong government should set up the law so & nbsp ; as to supervise the mass media .
I do n't need to use English in daily life .
I do n't have a strong reason to study English ,
I 'd like to read many books from English countries in English .
Whatever , I 'd like to use English for my work .

Chinese , Italian or Indian food .
I did not eat breakfast and am very hungry !
Right now I 'm watching the movie `` American Gigolo ( I do n't know how should I spell it ) ``
Richard Gere ( I do n't know again how should I spell it ) plays ( stars ) in the movie .
In the movie , he was very young and so fine , so cute !
The college student is busy ^ ^ ; ( or undergraduate student )
Do you think that the college class is difficult ?
I am majoring in electrical engineering .
But it 's tough to keep pace with myself .
I was trying to concentrate on studying for the exam , but the sound of cicadas
Besides , it was really hot today .
Therefore , I decided to go to the library and then I made a good progress .
I am now busy with the computer examination , which will take place this Saturday morning .
I scanned the book this afternoon , and found that it was boring and not relevant to daily life .
However , as a college school student , I have to accumulate the necessary certificates to get a good job .

His big smiley face makes me happy !
It is a charming garden city with picturesque scenery and pleasant weather .
SHENZHEN was setup as the economic special zone in 1980 .
It has developed from a small frontier town to a modern city , whose comprehensive economic strength has led the large and middle cities in china .
High - tech industries are feature that have constituted the first increasing section in the economic development of shenzhen .
In addition , there are about ten historical and cultural relics from the new stone age to Ming and Qing dynasties as well as modern revolutionary sites in china .
The china folk culture villages are showcases of the different arts , customs and architectural styles . ' being from life and yet going upon to a higher plain than life itself , absorbing what is good and rejecting what is bad ' is the guideline for the construction of the park
It 's easiest to listen to English in music , especially the Beatles and The Carpenters .
( Some music is impossible to listen to though ) . It 's second easiest to listen to English on the radio .
I often listen to J - wave in my car ( a Honda Fit ) .
The radio personalities on the programme are very friendly and polite , which means we can easily listen without getting offended , but sometimes I do n't like their goody two shoes attitudes .
At first , I noticed his familiar face when I was going to buy underwear at UNIQULO , the largest apparel company in Japan , but I was n't confident that he was my old friend .
Because I have n't met him since my junior high school graduation .
I did not write dairies for almost a week because I was lazy . ( I am not going to say BUSY ) My previous English tutor told me to never use BUSY as the excuse to postpone something , because no matter how busy you are , millions people will be busier than you such as presidents , CEOs , celebrities and a lot of people .
I went to the Chinese medicine hospital last Thu , helped my Japanese friend to find a sweet room on Fri , set up the internet and went to a darts bar with him on Sat , played beach vollyball and fooled around with some new friends at a beautiful beach in the north Taiwan on Sunday .
How do I become abetter English speaker ?
It 's just a matter of ( keeping ) practice .
Today , I got a day off and went to see the circus with my family .
The circus has run every season in this area
from ( since ) when I was a child .
I have never seen itlive ( or `` a live performance `` ) because I could have seen ( see ) it on TV
Actually , the live circus was interesting ,
My daughter 's pleasure was the best for me from this show .
But if someone asks me to go again , I wo n't go even ( if ? ) I pay .

brave : My friend said I 'm brave , but I could n't find any brave qualities in myself .
I wonder if the usage of `` serious `` above is correct . It is ! = )
Thank you for always writing comments .
I 'm happy and study them .
I think that it is difficult to always think in English .
Because I want to study abroad someday , I 'll do my best .
It is nice , because I can study and learn new words .
I enjoy life every day .
I started learning english . recently
English is very difficult to me , but I enjoy learning .
Two diaries in one day .
I always write a diary twice a day .
Because I write in Korean and in Lang - 8 .
Every day . ! ! !
well , sometimes I forget to write in korean .
Hehe - _ - ;
During spring break , I would go to bed around 3 a .
m and sleep till 1 p . m .
The new semester will start next week and some of my classes will begin at 11 a . m .
It 's a shame to let them pass me by because of oversleeping .
So I have been waking up at 8 a .
It 's not easy for me to wake up early and sometimes I feel an irrestitible urge to sleep during the day , but still I manage to get out of bed by at least 8 a .
I have an appointment to meet my boss at my new job tomorrow a bit late at night .
I will fight to keep myself awake tomorrow ! !
The package included an electronic dictionary that I borrowed from her a long time ago .
I had forgotten to return it , but she suddenly called me and asked for it to be returned .
So I found it in my desk and she sent it with some souvenirs .
I called my mom and let her know it was sent by my wife this morning .
After I finished my work , I met a friend who is member of the same English circle .
She has a lot of DVDs which at last count was over 200 !
I introduced her to Lang - 8 .
I said it was good for studying .
Then we went for a little drink and had a good time talking .
She said she wanted to begin studying an English radio program .
So we will study the same program and compare what we learnt every week .
It started raining just as I got home by bicycle .
Yesterday , I bought a great deal of ripened tomatoes .
I should or , actually , I have to study hard this week - end , but you know , there 's always some stuff that catches my attention more than studying .
What is Happiness ? Part 2
While I was listening to her story , I was looking at my dinner that had already became cold .
Both of us were n't eating .
She sometimes expressed her tears and sighed .
Actually , I listened to her since I could n't encourage her .
However , I listened to her story silently .
All I could do was to grip her hands .
To tell you to the truth , I really wanted to hug her , but I could n't because I did n't want to surprise her .
Hugging is n't a part of Japanese culture .
That 's life . : (
It is cheaper to play now compared with before .
Though the origins of golf are unclear , it seems that shepherds knocking stones into rabbit holes is an established theory .
If it had been kept that way , it would cost nothing , right ?
Anyway , I really want to see Tiger play golf .
It is raining hard today .
In Japan , there are a lot of typhoons in September .
I am worried about getting back home .
The train will probably have to stop .
My interpreter 's class was so tough for me last lesson .
The theme was about social participation in Japan .
One of my classmates made a presentation about how Japan is struggling and facing tough economic times as well as political issues .
For the past twenty years , specially middle - aged men in particular have had many abilities and privileges .
They could control all of Japan .
However they do n't have enough abilities and publicity now .
So , we need to get a second wind .
In the future more people who are women , non - residence and youth should participate in any social movements .
It should be better than now .
That theme felt abstract for me .
I thought she should have focused more on the concrete details .
We are , naturally , always looking for the best method , the fastest way , the easiest path to mastering English , Japanese , Spanish , whateverish . . .
On the other hand , good methods [ Assimil ? ] when used wrong can produce poor results .
In the end , what you should know , what you should [ at least you should . . . ] notice by yourself is that there is n't A SINGLE METHOD for language learning .
Each student has to find his own method , his own way of learning .
Of course , this is n't an easy thing to do .
I know some things work and some do n't , but to find out exactly how to do it is n't that easy .
All methods have good and bad points , so what you have to do is notice the good points and use them in your own way .
Of course I 'm being a bit theatrical , but I just want to show that there is n't one method that rules over all others .
If you work hard on it , you probably will not only find out which learning methods and strategies suit you better , but you also will start to notice some universal principles about language learning .
The average language learner , who usually follows just one methods ( like many English teachers here in Brazil who have taught English using the same method for more than 20 years ) , will probably not learn these principles and , therefore , become kind of limited when it comes to how to learn a language .
We had a very good time playing a chasing game in the water .
I 'm very happy to see that my daughter started to have more confidence in the water because she could n't put her face in the water before she went to swimming lessons .
She was even scared of getting a splash on her face when she had a shower .
Now she can do a headstand in the water !
As her school will have swimming lessons starting soon , hopefully she will have no problem in the water and can enjoy swimming with others .
I can tell the chlorine in the pool was very strong since a splash of the water hurt my eyes quite a bit .
In addition to that , I felt really tired after getting out of the water although I had n't swum much .
It is already December .
Did you enjoy every day so far ?
If you go , you will not regret it .
Study More English
I want to know more English words , and I look words up with a dictionary .
I do n't know many English words and grammar and idioms and culture , etc . , , , , , I have no choice but to study English every day .
That 's why I have to go to Canada . I want to go there ! ! !
So , I dooooooo n't give up ! ! !
I do n't lose myself !
But I 'm Japanese , so my thinking of things is in Japanese . x ( I want to think things in English .
Grammar is difficult for me . x ( I want to have confidence in my English .
I goofed off yesterday .
And then , I stopped at a supermarket near my house to buy something to eat .
When I came back home , I left the things I bought at the drug store and forgot about it !
I remembered 2 hrs later , so I rushed to the supermarket and asked the cashier where they were .
Fortunately , he kept them , and I found / took them .
Please explain the following sentences .
( It happened ) right before she lost control of her reactions / emotions .
How are you connected to this situation .
The big one found you attractive .
We know how troublesome / difficult it is to do .
But I have a sore throat .
I wanna try to sing some songs .
Therefore , whenever I sing a foreign song I 'm always stifled .
Plz teach me good singing skills .
In Japan there is a flu going around .
Actually , it 's all over the world , is n't it ?
I also got it the other day , in spite of having been immunized !
But now , my fever has gone down with Tamiflu , several different types of Chinese medicine , and with my parent 's good nursing .
It totaled out to 6000yen ( $ 73 ) in sales .
Book - Off is the largest franchise of used bookstores in Japan .
To bring 3 carton boxes of books , I rented a car at Kichijoji .
I 'm a member of a car sharing system ' Times plus ' and I can rent a car for short periods .
It 's a very good system for those who do n't want to own a car .
Hi , everyone .
I like travelling , taking photos and shopping . ( ^ - ^ )
I have been to Canada , Australia and Thailand .
I hope to go Europe , U .
, Egypt and Japan ( ha ha ) to see
world heritage sites .
I think it 's important to always value nature .
NO natures NO life ( ^ - ^ ) / /
I talked about studying abroad with the / my professor .
I ate out with a friend .
A short time ago , my friend changed into a cockroach .
I 'll write about the story that happened in my bathroom .
I washed oneself with my body sponge , like a panda as they do everyday .
Then , something happened .
Suddenly `` this fellow `` passed by me quickly !
It 's a cockroach ! `` I shouted , and pointed the shower head at it .
After a few minutes , I was able to regain my calm .
It stopped moving .
It was the sponge 's ( panda 's ) leg .
I somehow laughed .
I decided to operate on it ( decided to weave its leg . )
After that , it was back to normal .
Now , it watches me from the desk .
What a fearful story that was ! !
It is difficult for me to speak and write in English .
And let 's tell own language to each other ! !
My thinking has come to a standstill .
I have no ideas .
So , there is nothing and nothing again .
Where did my inspiration go ?
I traveled with my class 3 days ago .
Although we were tired everybody felt pleased .
We took many photos ; about 700 .
we went to an island , its name is Thung Nai and it is a new tourist spot .
People who live there are friendly , it has fresh air and many fruit trees .
After this journey I understand my friends better and love them so much .
I think they feel the same way .
Today in Yokohama it was rainy , though I had fulfilled my plan in my previous journal .
The heavy feeling of my body was relieved by indoor climbing exercise .
Afterwards , my palm skin peeled and I could hardly move my tired body .
But I 'll have a good night 's sleep .
I must fight the feeling of not wanting to go to my office .
I guess I 'll suffer muscle ache tomorrow morning .
I 've read The Scheme Team , the 5th book in the Chestnut Hill Series .
The Chestnut Hill Series is written by Lauren Brooke .
They are 7th grader students in a boarding school for girls called Chestnut Hill .
The school has good horse riding programs as well as educational programs .
They face some difficulties .
But in each case , they help each other to overcome these difficulties .
In this series , the relationship with horses is n't so much the main topic of the story , compared to the Heartland Series .
Still the heroines ' devotion to horses is prominent in the story .
The interviewers asked us [ 18 interviewees including me ] to come up with an idea of a new product and the marketing strategy to make it outstanding .
I was really surprised but not nervous because I take International Business Management at the university .
There had been two interviews before I got the internship program .
Moreover , one of the new employees who had just come to work only two weeks before told me to finish his work of a 19 page translation within 2 weeks .
And to compose 17 English vocabulary poems for a SAT course .
I was and still am infuriated with the way they treat an internship student .
I get only 100 Baht per day , which is about 3 dollars a day !
My son
It 's been two days since I registered at this site
What a great site !
Anyway , I have a one - year - old boy .
He ca n't talk at all yet , but he always says `` Oh ! `` .
Whenever he finds something ( a dog , a light , a button , etc . . . ) , he says `` Oh ! `` .
He discovers something every day like an inventor .
I woke up few minutes ago .
I have a meeting today , so there work that I have to do .
I 'm really late .
A Firework Display !
I went to a fireworkdisplay on August 7 .
It was held near the sea at my hometown .
About ten thousand of fireworks were set off .
I went there wearning a yukata with my friends .
Both of them were delicious !
After that , I watched the fireworks .
They were wonderful and I was excited ! !
Have you ever seen the movie `` This is it `` ?
In Japan , the movie got to No . 1 on a weekly movie chart .
A lot of my friends have seen `` This is it `` and all of them have been enthusiastic about Micheal Jackson .
I 've also been a Michael Jackson fanatic since I was a teenager , but I ca n't go see the movie because I have to take care of my two young children with my wife . . .
BTW , I can do the dances in Micheal Jackson 's music videos , like `` Thriller , `` `` Billie Jean , `` and `` Smooth Criminal `` .
I will teach the dance of `` Thriller `` to my friend who is a dance club member .
I made a GM , which appears in Japanese animation `` Mobile Suit Gundam . `` I like this robot .
It is also fun to paint differently from the original version .
Yesterday , I submitted my graduation thesis .
I thought that submitting it was the same as the certification of my graduation since my thesis was already checked by my professor .
But in fact , I understood that in March I have to take an oral examination .
I 'm a little disappointed with this .
I had planned how to spend my holiday . . .
The days I have to study will continue . .
JP are too nervous to survive !
and let them go abroad for one year or so ! !
I sympathize with that way of thinking ,
I participated ina training workshop for sports orthopedics .
Each doctor spoke about `` knee problems `` .
The content of the speeches interested me .
I was especially interested in the speech about `` movement of analysis `` .
maybe I caught a cold : (
I think that maybe I caught a cold .
Usually I 'm the one who always complains about the air - conditioner in my office .
I always feel hot and I always shout `` It 's too hot `` at my colleagues , but now I have to turn off the air - conditioner .
I sit near the window so it 's the hottest place in the room but now although the sky is full of sunshine and all the heat is coming through the window I do n't feel any warmer .
I have to take some medicine first before a real cold catches me ( ^ _ _ ^ )
This is my first time writing an article using English !
I 'm a university student in Japan !
I like baking sweets , going on trips , listening to music , and playing instruments .
I can play a guitar and a piano .
And I love Japanese culture so I am learning about the Japanese tea ceremony .
I want to work in a foreign country in the future : )
I 'm a student of the department of history . However , I must learn more than that . Such as international relations , English , and Japanese .
Everyday , I study those four aspects from 7 : 00 to 22 : 00 .
And I always have no time to do any others .
someone told me I must speak English very well .
I need friend and I need people to be content with me . However , people do n't like me . Atleast this is what I think .
who can help me or tell me what can I do ?
My Anxiety
He had secretly smoked with his friends .
His teacher came to our house .
He told me what had happened .
This is the first time that I have heard of their misbehavior .
I thought my son wanted to escape from being forced to study by me .
I reflected on myself a lot and said to him ,
`` You do not have to study so much , so you should stay home . ``
I have heard the sound of them walking on the roof .
One day I heard a voice in his room so I opened the door to his room .
Then , I saw two boys hiding behind the bunk bed .
I asserted to them about a few things .
I am sorry that you do not keep the promises you made with me about not smoking and studying harder .
What should I do ?
This is my first time to use this site .
So I would like to communicate with whoever wants to ( speak with me ) .
I tend to believe in ghosts because I was born in small town .
The population of my town was low .
My neighbor 's house was old so it was easily broken when a typhoon comes to our region .
Before I tried to sleep at night , I always went to the restroom where I can see their house .
I could n't do anything because I was a kid .
I called my mom : `` Hey , I found a cockroach so please kill them . ``
`` com ' on mom ! ``
`` hurry up ! ``
I often used something like that .
My high school years ( 4 )
They entertained me nearly through all of grade 2 .
Of course , I was worried about my behavior when I was found enjoying them .
They finally found out .
I was suspended to make a self - examination . ?
At the beginning , though , I found that I could not catch up with my lessons , for I had missed so many lessons .
Because of this , it took me four years to finish the three - year junior high school .
She likes the new hospital because the doctor explains to her well .
It 's at a very easy level .
I heard it 's good to read many books in a suitable level .
Now , the number of words I can read is 2666 words .
5th generation iPod nano
I bought a 5th generation iPod nano last December .
So it is not easy for me to use Apple products .
I can import music into my iPod nano but ca n't understand the way to import any pictures .
Finally , today , I found out how to import some pictures into it !
I am very happy about being able to do that .
I had a very busy day today . I had two classes , checked students ' notebooks and there was a business trip .
I was going to go to conversational English class , but the English teacher caught a cold yesterday , so today 's lesson was canceled .
I went to a Mexican restaurant , `` El Torito `` tonight and ate Enchilada , Salsa chips , Ceaser salad , and ice cream and drank a Margarita which was frozen with a salt fringe around the glass .
I like Margaritas very much , but its alcohol level is kind of high , so I 'm always getting sleepy after drinking .
There are many tv screens hanging on the wall and the tv channel is always sports channel `` ESPN . `` Today 's sport was baseball .
football season will start in August . . . . .
so now all that we can watch is baseball games and hockey games .
Today is Guy Fawkes Night ( or bonfire night ) in Oxford .
Although it is officially the fifth of November , the event is to be held Saturday night this year .
Last year my wife and I went to the bonfire held at South Park .
Although it was a cold night , the large park was full of people .
Guy Fawkes tried to blow up Parliament in order to kill King James I of England and VI of Scotland , but failed and was arrested on the fifth of November in 1605 .
The failed assassination attempt is now known as the gunpowder plot .
For some reason , the British have been celebrating this day with a bonfire and fireworks for more than 400 years .
I 'm not even sure that the British are in favour of or are against Guy Fawkes himself and his plot .
In my opinion , most of them may be taking advantage of his failed attempt as a reason / excuse to enjoy fireworks .
For me as a Japanese , fireworks on a cold autumn night are very unusual and is quite a surreal experience , since fireworks are icons of the hottest summer season in Japan , reminding me the humidity and hot air , girls wearing yukata ( by the way , girls with yukata look 30 % more attractive and prettier than usual ) , kakigori ( crushed ice with fruit - flavoured syrup ) , and so on .
When a British `` guy `` visits Japan and see fireworks festivals in summer , what would he think / how would he feel ?
Drowsiness
I stayed up all night last night , and so I am terribly sleepy today .
However , I do it anyway .
Because drowsiness harms study , it is necessary to take care .
In most schools in Japan there is vacation during summer .
But I must go to school tomorrow .
Our school starts vacation at the end of this week .
I am looking forward to it very much .
Packers v . s . Falcons
One of the division play - offs is `` Packers v . s . Falcons `` .
The Falcons have beaten the Packers this season .
This clip tells me that the next game will be too close to call .
This movie 's origin is the graphic novel `` WATCHMEN `` , written by Alan Moore , illustrated by Dave Gibbons .
I can say , `` WATCHMEN `` challenges the reader 's mind .
What is evil ?
What is justice ?
What is humanity ?
We can be allowed to sacrifice someone to save the world ?
I 've had no time to write on Lang - 8 .
I 'm writing on Lang - 8 for the first time in a month .
I went to Shiga prefecture last week , and stayed at Biwako Hotel beside a lake .
At night , I watched the harvest moon .
I completely forgot about a lot of work .
Then he begins climbing the stairs .
I study English almost every day .
But I 'm not good at English .
Therefore , I want to learn to read , write and speak English .
By the way , I have a Twitter account .
I went out to a Yakitori restaurant with my collegue after work last night .
It was so hot during the day , so I wanted to go to a restaurant in which air conditioning works .
When we stood in front of the door of that restaurant , we found the door was open .
I had a feeling that what I did n't hope for would now happen .
Due to the hot atmosphere I could drink much more beer .
I felt more comfortable as wind sometimes blew into the restaurant .
As you might know , the Yakitori is a popular Japanese food .
It is made from several bite - sized pieces of chicken meat , or chicken offal , skewered on a Bamboo skewer and barbecued .
It is served with salt or with `` Tare `` sauce , which is generally made up of mirin , sake , soy sauce and sugar .
Yesterday I went to a famous fortune teller .
She is in Harajuku Tokyo and is called `` Mother of Harajuku `` .
I always inquire about my job , my marriage and my health .
She said that I 'll meet my destined woman next spring ! !
I 'm looking forward to meeting her .
I just have a question :
How do you say TO and FROM in Japanese
Or when you give a gift ?
I write in my diary on Lang - 8 in English for the first time .
So , I try to write in my diary to learn how to use English .
I write in my diary every day as much as I can / as much as possible .
Today , I went to a restaurant to eat okonomiyaki with my friends .
I could eat as much as I wanted .
However , I ate too much and have a sore stomach .
I 'm studying the immune system now .
I will explain about my research in more detail someday .
I passed the qualification exam , `` Eiken , Pre - one grade `` a few months ago .
applicants , so I think that is why they 're going to hold this sample test .
In these months , I have not been a diligent student .
I 'm always busy these days !
These days I 'm always busy because school has started .
Since school started , I do n't have much time to do anything I want to do .
Unfortunately , the only thing that I have time for is studying , studying , and more studying .
We are all going crazy now .
This year my teachers are funny . Also , I have joined a modern drama club .
Drama club is funny and exciting .
My new life , is full of happiness and fun times .
But my life is also full of pressure .
So , I need to study hard now .
I bought some stocks last Oct .
Since then , I 've been really interested in economics .
The economics in Japan is easily affecteed by that of foreign countries ( especially US ) .
Of course not only Japan , many countries ' economics are affected by other countries ' economics .
Now , in my country , many people were fired , and what is worse , it 's difficult for anyone to find new job .
There 's alot of bad news like this now . . .
However , do n't you think the relationship of economics between one country and another is interesting ?
I think it 's still too early for me to talk about economics in English .
Since I 'd like to know about these places as much as possible , I am reading guide books and checking the internet every day .
I Have Become Aware
Recently , I 've become aware that it 's not easy to earn money .
We never earn money at the time of working .
Maybe there are some jobs that can get lots of money a day .
But I do n't think they are absolutely good jobs .
Have a nice day ! !
It is a nice weather today !
I like such a day .
I had only a class on management today . It was boring ,
It means that the final - exams are coming soon .
Maybe I gon na turn crazy . . . . .
But I am not in the mood to study . . . . I am so lazy . . . . . .
By the way I am about to leave for home
Today my college will hold an event ! I think it will be fun !
This event is held once a year .
I could meet a lot of friends ! I am very excited !
This story shall continue later . . . . . . . .
I cooked two hamburger dishes yesterday .
I was going to play tennis in the afternoon .
But what makes these two videos totally different ?
When the sun shines , I will hold your hand and together we will walk along the streets .
Today I 'd like to tell a story about a drunk who lost his keys .
It 's a famous joke , so you may have heard it
I think it is a simple story but it teaches us important lesson about our life .
One night , a man goes out to drink at a local bar .
After saying goodbye to his friends , he begins walking home , singing happily
As he is getting close to his apartment , he takes his keys out of his pocket but drops them on the ground in the dark .
Once he realizes his keys are missing , he wanders around a street lamp and begins looking for them
I had a trouble with my English .
Though I have been learning English for a long time .
I knew my problem was that I cound 't catch the meaning what people had said , and my pronunciation was too bad .
I wanted to be able to master English conversation , but I spent most of the time studying grammar and even I tried to read newspaper and novels .
All study are helpful , but some of them are not effective .
It is important for me to know what I want and focus on it .
Japanese comedians sometimes parody the foreigner 's way of speaking Japanese .
The way they do this is by omitting particles , incorrect accent and intonation and it seems that they can be categorised by nationalities .
I suppose this may be true from my experiences and acutally English children learn nursery rhymes by language acquisition .
Otherwise , if Japanese learners mimicked their rhythm , even if it was strange Japanese , they might obtain the skill to speak naturally .
Junzo Kawada is a researcher in cultural anthropology and he went to Africa to research a tribe whose language does not have letters .
He claimed that they use their imagination to convey to their drums .
When I listened to this story , I thought this is like typing to a keyboard .
Because there are rhythm patterns when you hit the keyboard .
It takes about a minute to go the station . ( by foot ? )
I 'm going to commute , by subway , to my office which is in Liu Jia Zui .
I have to transfer to `` line two `` at Jing An Si station .
It 's a big station and there are a lot of shops and restaurants around there .
I drink coffee everyday .
My favorite coffee is Coffee Mocha .
This is a chocolate flavored coffee .
Because it tastes very bitter .
What type of coffee do you like ?
Laptops make people lazy .
I hate to use the laptop because it makes me lazy .
I use the laptop on my bed , I surf the internet , and finally I watch dramas . . .
it makes me NOT STUDY , and NOT EXERCISE !
I worked until late tonight .
I 'm very tired and ( very ) sleepy .
What are the most popular English websites ?
Which of them are the majority of Englishmen / Americans visiting every day ?
The best would be those with interesting contents , news , or sites about science , computer science etc .
I want to improve my ability to write in English .
I finished my work a little earlier than usual and bought a birthday cake for her on the way back home .
Our oldest son had a headache during the daytime .
Today , I read a magazine about environment .
The magazine is NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC .
I was impressed by an article written about jet man .
He flew by jet engine , which made the man a bird .
so he was called Bird man .

It 's a sunny day today .

It makes me happy .
Yesterday I was not happy .
I went to my graduate school by bus .
On the way back home it was raining even more .
I got on the bus .
After I sat down , I checked my wallet .
Oh my god !
I had a bill of five thousand yen , but I did n't have anychange .
The fare of the bus was 220 yen .
On most Japanease buses , you ca n't get change .
He said he did n't have any change .
I asked him what should I do .
He said I could go without paying the fare , but next time I get on the bus I you should tell the driver this story , and pay the fare then .
I thanked him , and got off the bus .
On the way home from the bus stop I got soaking wet .
Hi everyone , nice to meet you .
Because Gunma is not a famous like Tokyo , and Kiryu is in that prefecture 's countryside .
I had to pay for electricity and Internet .
In Tanzania , almost everything is an advance payment system while everything is a later payment in Korea .
Here , I use a prepaid electricity system called LUKU .
I have to buy voucher first if I want to use electricity .
( I 'm not sure whether voucha is an English word or not . ) ( voucher is correct )
in case of mobile phone and Internet and so on . . . . .
I could n't use internet during last weekend beause my internet valid period was over on last Friday .
Thus , I had to go to town today .
I bought some fruit and a bottle of wine on my way to town .
I also bought a wine glass to drink / for drinking wine .
I drank a glass of wine and I felt so good .
I may look like an alcoholic : - (

Recently , we can see foreign sumo wrestlers , especially from mongolia .
If he wins the championship this season , he will be selected as `` Ozeki `` .
I had planned to go skiing with my family this weekend ,
but I canceled when we heard about this disaster .
It would have been the first time for my children to go skiing .
