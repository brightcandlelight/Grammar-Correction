A family , see m ing ly a father , a mother and two of their ch il d re n , get in a c ar .
F un k y m us ic start s , play ing some bad o b s c en it ies .
It see m s they do n ' t care so much about it s ly ri c s and ri d e on to the r h y th m .
This co m m er c i al f il m is re ally re f le c ting what happen s to English le ar n er s .
C h ar a c ter s of the sea s on s are comp le te ly different from each other in J a p an .
In sp r ing , we can see not only p l um s and ch er ry b l o s s o m s , but also a tra il ing mi st a cross mo un tain s which is a c r ow n ing be a ut y in the morning .
In s um m er , if you go to the country s id e , many f i re f l ies will we l c ome you .
It must be a f ant a st ic scene .
In a ut um n , es pe c i a ly l ate a ut m n , when you look at the re ed s f l ash ing ( ? ) go l d en and the leave s turn ing re d or y e ll ow , you will sure ly feel ha p p y , as if you were dr e a m ing .
In w in ter , s il ent s n ow in d ic ate s great in te ll i g ence ( / w is d o m ) which man can not have .
In respon se to the question as to which sea s on I like , it must be the time of sea s on al change .
I mi s s pass ing sea s on s with affect ion , while I a d m i re coming sea s on s .
J a p an e se va l u e e v an es c ence .
The be a ut y of the ch er ry b l o s s o m is not so much in it s appear ance , but it s e v an es c ence .
The life of a f i re f ly is very short .
I w an n a le ar n J a p an e se but I ' m so bu s y and I c a n ' t ty pe J a p an e se on this P C in the coming week s .
I like it here , so does K i ch an
It ta st ed very good ! !
It take s two hour s to co m m ut e to work to and f ro .
I take a sub way to work and change train s t w ic e .
I study my English b ook s in the train .
U s u ally , we us e them only when we go far away .
To day I need ed to go to the po st office to p ic k up a letter from J a p an .
I us ed a high way just to go to the po st office .
I think my J a p an e se friend s would never believe this .
J a p an w on against A r g ent in a ! I ' m so ex cited !
But I could n ' t see the game .
D o you know about M A N G A c a f es ?
D o es any on e know about M an g a c a f es ?
A M an g a c a f e is where you can read many many M an g a .
In the M an g a c a f es they give us se p ar ate room s .
The ir p ri ce s are l ow so many g en er ation s can us e them .
If you come to J a p an and your are good at J a p an e se , I suggest going a M an g a c a f e .
B y the way , M an g a c a f es have many different s ur r ound ing s .
They have good s ur r ound ing s .
In I K E B U K U R O , K I T I T Y O U Z I , S I B U Y A have good one . ( ? )
T h an k you for read ing ^ ^
It is the first time I ' ve [ I have ] come here .
He ll o ! !
Yes ter day , I went dr in k ing with my friend s from when I was co ll e g e st ud ent .
One of them is work ing for a J a p an e se a ut o m a k er .
Some time s he go es around the world .
en j ot it ! I ' m enjoy ing it !
I de c id ed to read al o ud us ing the A F N b ook .
The first se ction was the in a u g ur al address of B ar a c k O b a m a as the n ation ' s 44 th p re s id ent .
U s u ally I c ar ry my I - po d to listen to some m us ic and English pro g r a m s .
To day I found out a new thing about English .
The sen t ence is ( sp a ce ) `` I can not than k you enough ``
I felt this sen t ence sound ed like that person is n ' t gr ate ful .
Y e a h I le ar n ed to day one thing to day .
I put a fish , which was his f a v o ur ite f o o d , on his gra ve .
I can think of nothing , because I am tired now , or just p re ten d ing to be tired now .
What I am do ing now look s like nothing , but it ' s ( ? ) coming from no where , or it is just that I have to think more to find out what is need ed .
I have trouble with my st ud ies , live l i h o o d and my girl f ri en d ( who may leave soon )
I went to a c a f e near my school to read b ook s and I walk ed for a long time .
H on est ly I need to cha ll e ng e my G er man .
But it does n ' t mean that I ' m g i v ing up .
There are a l ot of students from va ri ous co un t ri es .
E ng l and , I ta ly , A ust ri a , S l o v a k i a , S er b i a e t c .
S in ce this was my first time meeting S l o v a k i an and S er b i an people ,
A l m o st all con ver s ation was in English , but I would have to say I had much difficult y co m m un ic at ing with them .
My co m m un ic ation s k i ll in English is not good enough , particular ly for listen ing .
In addition to that , every body had a different a c c ent in English includ ing me .
So they tri ed to me m or i z e it by as s o c i at ing it with `` H i ro s h im a ( J a p an e se c ity ) ``
It sound s funny , I never hi t upon such an idea .
But I think H i ro s h i is e as i er than H i ro s h im a , because it ' s short er , is n ' t it ?
N ic e to me e t u ~ ~ I ' m a fresh man here ~ ~ I was b or n in C he ng d u , C h in a .
I ho pe I can make friend s with you ~ ~
I ho pe every on e has a n ic e day ~ ~
T h an k you ~ ~ ~ ~
When I happen d to walk by the front of a k im on o sh op , a c ut e you ng c l er k we ar ing k im on o talk ed to me w h il st s m il ing .
Some pretty girl s we ar ing k im on o were in K y ot o or U n ive r s al S t ud i o J a p an in O s a k a on the picture s .
We talk ed about k im on o s and things for a long time .
The c l er k said , `` If you have time , why do n ' t you try this on ? ``
O f c or se I tri ed it .
I had enough time and I do n ' t have any k im on o s in s te ad of y u k at a .
The k im on o which I tri ed on was re ally beautiful .
I was sat is f i ed with try ing it on and had f un talk ing with the c l er k .
But K im on o ' s are very ex p en s ive , I c a n ' t a f f or d to bu y it now .
It see m s that to day will be a re ally n ic e day .
There are n ' t any c l o ud s in the s k y . The s un is sh in ing and there is no w in d .
A l s o , it is 3 de g re es C el s i us , but it is on ly 1 1 a . m . To day I ' m going to play b as ke t b a ll in the s k ate p ar k .
B y the way , in the N B A , the O k la h o m a C ity T h un d er s w on ver s us L .
L a k er s and are n ow 2 - 2 in the s er ies .
m E S T time , C le ve l and will play ver s us C h ic a g o .
I ho pe the C a v al i er s will w in .
It like the sp r ing had come already here in C h u b u are a , the c ent er of J a p an .
This is a quick di g re s s ion , and the head qu ar ter s of hot T O Y O T A is here .
And yesterday was my pay day , so I with d re w some money from A T M .
But it took me no less than 1 0 0 yen to with d r a w some money as it was on sat ur day .
you see , just to with d r a w money !
The b an k s are so bu d g e t - mind ed . Why should I pay money to with d r a w my money ?
What do you think about it ?
T h ough I make f us s over it , I take out my money on week en d s .
B y the way , I walk ed to the con v i ence st or e on f o ot since it ' s so close .
I could see many sp r ing f l ow er s out there , and I was able to feel sp r ing is act u ally around the corner .
I looked up other w or d s to mean w ar m and found `` as s n u g as a bu g in a r u g `` .
I found it is ver y interest ing .
My name is P h y ten !
I am a st ud ent in H it ot s u b ash i U n ive r s ity , and my ma j or is e c on o m ic s .
( He re is a l is t of my ho b b ies . . . )
P la y ing g u it ar , read ing b ook s ( es pe c i ally on business and f in ance ) , play ing bad m in t on , s ur f ing the In ter ne t , pro g r a m m ing , and talk ing ( cha t ting ) with my friend s !
A l s o we can play with our ne i g h b or s . No t only we can make good friend s but also we can sp en d qu al ity time to g e ther .
M a y b e I gue s s there is a saying , `` There will be for t un es to people who do n ic e things for their ne i g h b or s . `` .
If we sha re the f o o d s to our ne i g h b or s when they are becom ing poor , then we can get some f o o d from them when they become o k a y and I become poor .
N e x t , we should act in a polite and po s it ive manner to w ar d s our ne i g h b or s .
N e i g h b or s are the part of our life and so c i e ty , and all people like the ne i g h b or s who are very n ic e .
We should be friend ly , help ful , and act in a s u it able manner if we want to become a n ic e ne i g h b or s .
I ' ve finish ed my work .
I f i x ed some pro g r a m co d e .
On this line ' N in j a ' train s - train s with n in j as ' face s p a in ted on - run every day .
But the train I ' m tak ing is not a ' N in j a ' train .
It does n ' t mean I got los t but that I los t my b an k c ar d .
T i ll re c ent ly , I was always a b s ent - mind ed for some reason .
I kept think ing about things while walk ing on the ro ad or sit ing in the train .
A fter I found out that the c ar d was not in the right place .
I e m p t i ed my b a g and an x i ous ly c he c k ed it 3 ( three ) time s . with .
But I still could n ' t find it .
Then , I called my family to let them . re p or t the los s to the b an k im m ed i ate ly .
I c a n ' t do that any more .
But what can I do ?
I just got home , re c ent ly I ' ve been get ting back home l ate because of my job .
I re ally want to say than k you to every on e who c or re c ted my mistake s and sen t me a me s s age .
I am now ex change st ud ent in A m er ic a , and this is the first time I have ever live d without my family , so my p ar ent s w or ri ed a l ot when I said good b y e to them at the a ir p or t .
But I re as s ur ed them by saying that I would sen d e m a il s .
A t first g l ance , my room m ate act u ally left a very good impress ion on me because she was 5 year s old er than me , which made me feel she would s up p or t me in so many way s .
When I ar ri v ed at my room , she was with her J a p an e se bo y f ri en d , so she in t ro d u c ed him to me and told me that if I had any J a p an e se question s , I could just as k her bo y f ri en d .
I felt that I was so l u c k y that G o d ga ve me such a n ic e room m ate , because she seemed to be very pro te c t ive .
F or a girl who had left home for the first time , it re ally help ed a l ot ! !
A t least , she ga ve a made me feel se c ur e , though her bo y f ri en d always stay ed in our room even at the be d time .
To let my room m ate know that I would not be a th re at to her re l ation s h i p , I only brought up my question s when she was there as well .
There f or e , she ho p ed that I could turn to other J a p an e se for help in s te ad .
As a re s ul t , I w ro te a not e to her , apologize d and made it clear that I did not mean to up se t her .
If she felt hu r t , I would stop do ing it right away ! !
Even though her bo y f ri en d told me that he felt his girl f ri en d was too e m o tion al and that I could still con s ul t him question s when she was away , I de c line d his kind ness and hard ly spoke to him .
O ri g in ally I thought that everything would just go back to normal , to the very begin n ing when I was on good terms with her .
However I was to t ally wrong because now she only give s me the co l d should er .
L a st time , I f u z z ed every time as speak ing more than usual .
S ound s ir on ic , does n ' t it ?
What I mean is the more I study about express ion s or v o c a b ul ar ies , the more I ' m con f us ed , because every time I try to us e new things , it does n ' t come to my mind as a ut o m at ic ally as I wish , and it make s me m ur m ur ( ? ) .
It ' s because I have a school tri p on S ept e m b er 7 - 9 .
A l th ough I live in F u ku s h im a in J a p an , I ' ll be going to Tokyo in J a p an . ( F u ture T en se )
So I need to be read y for my school tri p soon .
I ' ll write about my school tri p when I get back home .
This le ad s to no where .
I want to try myself against the ma ter i al world .
O ur turn is at 1 4 : 2 5 .
I ' m going to my un ive r s ity , and start ing ch o ir p r a c t ic e from now on .
I live in a do r m with an in ter n ation al st ud ent from the U .
She is very good at J a p an e se and always help s me study English .
However , because she speak s J a p an e se so well , I some time s he s it ate to speak English .
M or e o ver , she always speak s J a p an e se in s te ad of us ing English , so I do n ' t have enough ch ance s to speak English .
There f or e , I try to de c id e `` O N L Y E N G L I S H D A Y `` and I as k her to speak only English d ur ing that day !
I ' d go back in time , if I could : (
A n n z u was a str a y c at and was pe c k ed by c r ow s in a p ar k , before a volunteer s a v ed her life .
When she came to my house for the first time , she was so s k in n y that we could n ' t hu g her ti g h t ly .
To day , I begin la ng - 8
I ' ve been study ing English since I was a j un i or high school st ud ent .
I can understand w r ri ten E m g l ish , for ex amp le new s paper s ,
but I c a n ' t listen and write English .
The class con s is t s of students and teachers .
I had to speak many time s , so it was pro f it able .
G o s s i p G ir l is a p op ul ar A m er ic an T V s er ies that was in t ro d u c ed to C h in a as a fashion and life style b ook .
In the show s , S er an a and B la ir are the most l u c k y girl s who are ri ch , beautiful , cha r m ing , and so on .
They po s se s s all the things which was most girl s want to have in the world over all .
The people in the up p er e a st live in a go r g e ous and la v ish are a , p l us they are el ite who know how to man age m ul t in ation al c or p or ation s even though may b e in he ri ted them from family .
O b v i ous ly , they are in the sp ot light in any part ies at N e w Y or k they go to at night .
We are mo r t al , direct ly I en v y that kind of bu le ( ? ) b l o o d people .
Let me c ite a fashion able w or d `` hold `` which is f ant as y of an am a z ing girl in C h in a .
I want to go to N Y some day .
One of the serious pro ble m s in J a p an .
I watch ed a T V new s b ro ad c a st which was about the high number s of s u ic id e among you ng er people around 2 0 to 3 0 year s old .
The new s said that the number s have con t in u e to in c re a se over the last 1 0 year s .
I think that most you ng er people in J a p an have no dr e a m s or purpose for the future .
Then they feel themselves as us e less to the world and that they have no reason to live any m or e .
A n y way , present ly , we are much ri ch er ma ter i ally than we have been in past , but our mind s have we a k en ed .
And J a p an e se so c i e ty is in a g ing so c i e ty . We are run n ing out of you ng er people in the work for ce .
Some h ow we must stop you ng er people from co m m it ting s u ic id e , or our so c i e ty will co ll a p se much soon er than we expect ed .
I went to O it a , my home town , for about three week s for s um m er va c ation , and I came back home three days a g o .
I felt a fresh a p p re c i ation of my p ar ent s this time because of going back to my home town .
I also re al i z ed how I had always had a l u x ur i ous life .
I did n ' t feel l on e ly before I went back to O it a , but still if I go back once , I will get a c c ust ome d to my old life with do g s , a s is ter and p ar ent s , so when I am alone again , I will feel very l on e ly .
But in fact , I ' m know that it is too bad for me because I ' m going a b ro ad to A m er ic a for four year s as a un ive r s ity st ud d ent .
No ne of my friend s live s near my house , so when ever I go sh op p ing , I am alone .
It is only a matter of time now before I start my class ( again ) , so I ' m look ing for w ar d to see ing my friend s now .
This happen ed a f e w month s a g o .
I was on the p l at f or m , wait ing for a train , as usual .
She seemed to be over 5 0 year s - old , and came near to
where I was stand ing , because there was public p h on e near me .
She put money into p h on e , then di al ed .
`` O h , I ' m sorry I ' m going to be l ate . `` the woman said in a loud voice that
She con t in u ed talk ing .
`` I was having a po o . ( l o l . . )
It was re ally big one so it took a long time to f l us h . ``
That ' s why I mi s s ed the train .
I ' m sorry I c a n ' t be there on time , but it could n ' t be f l us h ed ``
She de s p er ate ly explain ed that it was n ' t her fault , but her po o s fault .
Some time s people make ex c us es for their mistake s , such as t ar d i ness
However , I have never heard such a ch il d ish ex c us e .
O ther w is e , no body will believe her .
E ver y day , going to the office , I watch a v id e o on my i P o d to u ch .
R e c ent ly I ' ve been watch ing `` S es ame S t re e t ``
for the purpose of study ing English .
`` S es ame street `` is f un for me .
But it ' s ex c it ing story ti re s me some time s .
The w or d ' ex c ite ment ' mean s `` H i - ten s y on `` -
M a y b e it is bad English .
`` s es ame street `` is us e ful for study ing e ng l ish .
about `` less ex c it ing `` English study ing v id e o s .
I had a dr e a m that I dr o ve a c ar and it f e ll off from the ro ad .
I had to lie down before I c he c k ed the e - ma il yesterday .
So , may b e I think I might have an all er g y to po ll en .
In sp r ing I get dr y s k in and my eyes become very it ch y . . .
S t ud y ing English
He ll o , every on e .
My name is K A O R I and I live in J a p an O s a k a .
I had st ud i ed English while I was a st ud ent , but I c a n ' t understand English now .
This tra um a is very he a v y to me .
So , I de c id ed to start study ing English at this sit e .
P le a se tea ch me the c or re c t English .
So re c ent ly I have not up d at ed my di ar y .
I work in a tra d ing comp an y .
We receiv e te le p h on e call s from a b ro ad , take care of for e i g n c ust ome r who visit s J a p an , go on business tri p s to do re se ar ch at va ri ous con f er ence s and ex h i b i tion s .
I believe some day I will im p ro ve my English if I keep on study ing and up d at ing ( my di ar y on ) this we b s ite .
W ow . . what a good we b s ite this is !
This is my first time writing here .
I want to me e t many people from other co un t ri es !
I ' m very interest ed in class ical g u it ar , but I c a n ' t play well .
A fter I gradua te from co ll e g e , I would play the g u it ar free ly ! !
To night the W or l d c up J a p an v s P ar a g u a y game is on !
I want to s up p or t the J a p an e se tea m , but I have to go to my part - time job . . . .
D V D sh op have many d v d s : 2 4 , p ri s on bra ke , u g ly be t ty , go s s i p girl , f r ing e , and so on . . .
What is your re c o m m en d ation ?
The J a p an e se go ver n ment w ar n ed people that there was a po s s i b il ity of e le c t ri c p ow er f a il ur e in the Ka n t o re g ion yesterday after no on .
Tokyo p ow er comp an y had already stop p ed their s er v ic e in the s ch ed ul ed are a
but they said there was still not enough p ow er .
I f il led p la st ic bo t t le s , p ot s and bu c ke t s with as much water as possible .
We c a n ' t us e water if we have a p ow er f a il ur e .
My a p ar t ment is s er v ing water to each family with e le c t ri c p ow er .
F or t un ate ly , we a v o id ed the c ri s is , al th ough all the A T M s te m p or ar i ly did n ' t work at one ma j or J a p an e se b an k .
The F a ll a p p ro a ch es .
It was ra in n ing day . It was ra in ing to day
The we a ther in K or e a is a little co l d d u e to the change of sea s on s .
F or that reason , I thought about a l ot of things .
So , now I ' m ment ally over l o ad ed .
I should do something f un !
Yes ter day , I hung out to re la x .
I walk ed from S h i b u y a to H ar a j u ku and return ed to S h i b u y a .
It was a n ic e we a ther , so I felt well .
It was a ha p p y day , because I went to a sp ot I never go .
I for g ot what I want ed to write about to day .
My ce ll p h on e was n ' t work ing well .
I thought my ce ll p h on e f in ally b ro ke down , because it did n ' t re a c t even after I p re s s ed the but t on s .
I almost los t my comp o s ur e .
I not ic ed that my friend ' s ce ll p h on e is the same ty pe as mi ne .
He was study ing , but I b ro ke in because I did n ' t a f f or d to care for him .
He told me some i nformation about the ce ll p h on e and suggest ed that I call c ust ome r s er v ic e .
A fter he had finish ed his story , I tri ed to call c ust ome r s er v ic e .
The moment I called to the c ust ome r c ent er , I not ic ed that I was us ing my ce ll p h on e and it was work ing as usual .
I think it is because of my a g ing .
E ver y time I write an es s a y , I us e a l ot of the same tra n s i tion al w or d s .
If you know a va ri e ty of tra n s i tion al w or d s , could you please let me know ?
I have had l ot s of work to do , but I need to keep my le ar n ing time some h ow .
It ' s difficult for me to do two things at the same time .
But I ' ll try hard , ho p ing that I can keep up at least once a week .
I want to be an in ter n ation al translation volunteer .
So may b e I should p r a c t ic e English of ten , ho p ing that L an g - 8 will help .
O ut s id e was too hot , so I went home e ar ly and stay ed in the living room .
The reason why is that the living room is the only room that has an a ir condition er .
I live in S a in t P e ter s b ur g near the me t ro st ation `` P l o s ha d My g est v a `` .
This st ation is not sit u at ed in the c ent er of the c ity , but I very of ten go to the c ent er to walk on the beautiful street s .
M an y of S t P e ter s b ur g ' s street s still have some sp e c i al his t or ical f e a ture s .
L it t le co ur ty ar d s , narrow street s and bu il d ing s from the 1 9 th c ent ur y s ur r ound you and can im m er se you in this f ant a st ic time .
And a l ot of c ar s , sh op s and co f f e e house s c a n ' t b re a k this i ll us ion .
You can walk in this c ity for many days and every day you will dis c o ver some new de ta il s of this at m o s p he re for you s el f .
M an y time s I just walk on `` N e v s k y pro s pe c t `` and go to A le k s and er N e v s k y square .
Some time s when I ' m not in a hu r ry , I just turn right or left at r and o m cross ro ad s and a im less ly walk around the little street s to feel the un i qu e at m o s p he re .
If you are ever in S a in t P e ter s b ur g and you have a l ot of free time , I a d v is e you to just walk around the c ity for one or two hour s without any p l an , and you will feel the un i qu e at m o s p he re of the 1 9 th c ent ur y .
I was surprise d at / by how big they were .
I thought that the se c u c um b er s were more than t w ic e as large as one s in J a p an .
I re c o g n i z ed that even the same ve g e t able s can have / be different sha pe s .
I began us ing L an g - 8 to day .
I ' m not good at English , there f or e I think that I should write short sen t ence s every day .
This is my first time writing a di ar y .
I ' m J a p an e se . I ' m 2 1 year s old .
My name mean s ch er ry b l o s s o m s , which is the most p op ul ar f l ow er in j a p an .
I live in Ka n a g a w a p re f e c ture which is near Tokyo .
I ' m le ar n ing about ' E n v ir on ment and H um an ity ' in my U n ive r s ity .
My ho b b ies are da n c ing , listen ing to hi p - ho p m us ic and going to m us e um s .
In M ar ch I ' m going to go to C o l or ad o S t ate U n ive r s ity in the U S A .
If you find any er r or s , please c or re c t them .
My year end re s ul t will come out this T h ur s day .
I feel pretty an x i ous wait ing for this day .
I ho pe to pass with f ly ing co l o ur s !
Even though I try to write short ent ri es , I re g re t that no body c or re c ted yesterday ' s ent ry . . .
You do you think I should do to get c or re ction s ?
P le a se give me some a d v ic e on how to get more c or re ction s .
W o ul d you please c or re c t the ent ry I made yesterday ?
Yes ter day I went to a hot sp r ing and the b ook st or e .
The hot sp r ing was very good .
A t the b ook st or e I b ough t a te x t b ook on English pro f ic i en c y .
Some day I want to be pro f ic i ent in English .
I went to school before going to the hot springs and b ook st or e .
It was to me e t with fellow teachers .
I made c he e se c a ke and de l ive r ed it to the fellow who had to work .
( * The second picture is a view of the near b y hot springs . )
M a th is a very im p or t ant sub j e c t in K or e a .
If you give up on this sub j e c t , you give up on co ll e g e .
But I am re ally poor in ma th .
I c a n ' t understand ( it ) at all .
When ever I try to so l ve a question , I just get st u c k .
How I can get better at ma th ?
so I de c id ed to sen d a present for her to day !
She like s to eat J a p an e se s n a c k s so I de c id ed to sen d her a p l ent y of J a p an e se s n a c k s .
M o st of it are ri ce c r a c k er s in different ta st es .
I can not see the end of the t un n el .
I can not go back , and all I can do is to go for w ar d while to u ch ing the wall of the t un n el .
I some time s ex pe ri ence f e ar , de p re s s ion and l on el i ness , but I have to con qu er them if I want to become a f l u ent English speak er .
I almost los e my con f id ence of whether I can do it or not . . . . . .
It was too co l d to us e my room to day .
The he at er in my room is not w ar m enough , so I de c id ed us ing my la p t op in my living room .
A ccord ing to the we a ther new s , this co l d we a ther will last unti l tomorrow .
I wonder if I ' ll us e my room tomorrow .
I do n ' t like to go out d ur ing a long ho l i day , every where is c r ow d ed with c ar and people .
It ' s not easy to go for a f e w me ter s in a tra f f ic j a m .
M o st of C h i an g M a i re s id ent s will stay at home for ce le b r ation with f a m il ies , while the visit or s from around the world ch o o se to co un t d ow n on the street .
H a ve you see n any a c c id ent s on the street in this sea s on ?
A fter the ce le b r ation s finish , the dr un k en dr ive r s need to go back home , but they always los t their con t ro l in dr i v ing .
D ur ing this f est i v al we wish there was less dis aster or los s .
The police st ation has a s er v ic e to provide a c up of co f f e e or a f o ot ma s s age for a long dis t ance dr ive r .
We have only a small ho pe that there will be less los s than last year .
O ur long ho l i day last s from 3 1 st D e c 2 0 0 9 to 3 r d J an 2 0 1 0 includ ing the begin n ing and finish ing day . It ' s six days in to t al .
L ate ly , I sp en d a l ot of my time on the comp ut er .
The reason is that it is on my t able .
When I start us ing the comp ut er I go ma d with the in ter ne t .
But I c ur e that now us ing this pro g r a m :
This pro g r a m show s how much time you sp en d us ing the comp ut er
So since I ' ve started us ing this pro g r a m , my comp ut er time has go ne down
It ' s re ally s um m er , is n ' t it ?
It ' s . l u x ur i ous !
It ' s re m in is c ent of a ta s te d ur ing my ch il d h o o d in my home t ow n .
When I close my eyes , I can see myself eat ing c or n , sit ting outside in front of my house .
A ll of the do or s and w in d ow s are open , because there is no a ir [ sp a ce ] condition er .
In my home t ow n , there is a very beautiful ri ver .
Some time s we went to the ri ver with c u c um b er s , to m at o es , some c he a p me l on s and o c c as ion ally water m el on s .
It was the most enjoy able time for us students .
I still re m e m b er the c u c um b er s and to m at o es , with j ust a little s al t on them . They ta st ed very good !
But please do n ' t as k me what I at e for dinner yesterday .
I had a p re - speech con t est to day .
U n f or t un ate ly I did n ' t make it to the f in al because I made a f l u f f .
I was also told by a teacher that I made a f l u f f because I did n ' t speak from my heart .
That was a blow to me .
I know this is kind of a small matter but it was very , very re g re t t able any way ! !
P le a se give me your a d v ic e .
A t this class , l ot s of people were A m er ic an teachers .
A fter that , I draw a picture about tree s .
A t that , we s un g a l ot of B e at le s ' so ng s .
It was de l ic i ous but , I was still hung ry .
Then , I s un g a so ng called `` U n d er the S e a . ``
I could n ' t s un g very good because my voice was so high .
To day was re ally full of f un , because we did a l ot of things .
And I ' m interest ed in F u el C e ll re se ar ch and the In ter ne t .
There are n ' t any st im ul at ing things at the U n ive r s ity .
W or k ing or study ing en er g y and en v ir on ment al te ch no l o g ies includ ing F u el C e ll re se ar ch in gradua te school .

When I turn ed my comp ut er on , the s c re en was b l an k
F in ally , my comp ut er started to work again .

I mi s s ed it in J an u ar y since I got the f l u the day before the t est .
There f or e I ' m glad to be able to take it this time .
I wonder if my English v o c a b ul ar y has been im p ro v ing d ur ing this per i o d .
I had my ha ir c ut to day because s um m er is coming soon .
The le ng th of my ha ir is pretty short now , comp ar ed to before .
I feel so good .
To day , I went to the ( / my ) office by c ar .
I ri d e on a train as usual .
But , it was re ally hot and hu m id e to day .
I did n ' t want to walk for a long time .
I like dr i v ing ( my c ar ) !
But , my c ar is get ting w or se because it is so old .

I think I ' d better bu y a new c ar .
But , I do n ' t have enough money : ( .
P le a se do n ' t b re a k c ar ! ! !
My b ir th day is on S ept e m b er 2 1 st .

I want to go on a to ur of E ur o pe some time in the future .
To day , my mo m told me that in a high school in my home t ow n , there was a st ud ent s u ic id e .
S w im m ing is difficult for me al th ough I live in S o ut he a st C h in a , a place ri ch in ri ver s and la ke s .
D ur ing this s um m er va c ation , I de c id ed to le ar n it .
I have already had two s w im m ing class es from which I have le ar n ed some b as ic s w im m ing s k i ll s . With more and more p r a c t ic e , I have f al le n in l o ve with it . It can keep me f it . What ' s more , it ' s also a good way to re la x .

My mo b i le p h on e is a D o C o M o f o m a .

So , I want to change to a s m ar t p h on e .
To day , I went to a D o C o M o sh op , _ and I to u ch ed / looked at a R e g z a p h on e .
Yes ter day my family visit ed the N ation al M us e um .
So on the s n ow turn ed into s n ow st or m .
When I push ed the b re a k p ed al , the c ar did n ' t stop p .
A t the time , the A B S work ed and the c ar stop p ed
We ar ri v ed at the m us e um only to find that a re s er v ation was ne ce s s ar y .

To day , I was ted a l ot of time wait ing .
I wait ed the ent i re morning for my comp an y ' s c ar to help me de l ive r a she l f to my c ust ome r and also wait ed for my c ust ome r to put the she l f in the s up er m ar ke t the who le after no on .
What a b or ing day this was !
but I need to w a ke up now , because the s un is already high . . . ? ?
and also it s S un day to day , , I need to go to the C h ur ch may b e la ter , , and la ter too at 3 p m . .
I am going to the B - day P ar ty of my gra d e school class m ate s it s her d aught er 1 st b - day , , and also it s been a long time since I saw her , . .

In H on g K on g , the go ver n ment f o c us es on the dr u g pro ble m .

However , there are no pro g r a m s to de al with you ng people ' s se x u al be ha v i o ur .
But why has this is s u e in re c ent year s been even more serious ?
The re se ar ch er s not e that `` If w ome n are ex po s ed to a b us e , do m est ic v i o l ence , and family str if e , it has end ur ing effect s . ``
A l s o there are many case s which te en age r s give up their b a b ies in the street or have an a b or tion .
The most im p or t ant thing is , they do not think they are wrong .
She w ro te a di ar y and po st ed her p re g n an c y p h ot o s on the In ter ne t .
She was pro ud of her p re g n an c y .
We have three kind s of so l u tion s to so l ve the te en age p re g n an c y pro ble m .
The second one is no n - go ver n ment and so c i al work er s . The last one is con s ul ting with other co un t ri es ' po l ic ies .
F ir st ly , go ver n ment should in ve st more in se x education .
A l s o , te en age r s feel e m b ar r as s ed co m m un ic at ing with their teachers and p ar ent s .
The ir pe er gr o up also affect s them .
F or ex amp le , their pe er gr o up may give them the wrong me s s age s regard ing & n b s p ; se x .
T e en age r s may mi s un d er st and is s u es regard ing se x when they receiv e in c or re c t i nformation from their & n b s p ; pe er gr o up .
They are c ur i ous about se x and want to try it .
S e x education re d u ce s the ra te of te en age p re g n an c y .
T e a ch er s can take care of te en age r s when teaching them s a f e se x .
A l s o , it can re d u ce their c ur i o s ity and let them le ar n the the c or re c t va l u es .
M or e o ver , ma s s me d i a give s un s u it able me s s age s to you ng people . F or ex amp le , M o ther at 1 4 ( te le v is ion dr a m a ) , My G u ar d i an C h ar a c ter s ( ch il d re n ' s co m ic b ook ) , and J un o ( F il m ) provide & n b s p ; ne g at ive me s s age s .
They may think te en age p re g n an c y is a un ive r s al p h en ome n on and part of & n b s p ; We s ter n c ul ture , or that & n b s p ; it is not a pro ble m and not sp e c i al .
A l s o , it can be per ce ive d as a t re n d to follow .
So , the H on g K on g go ver n ment should set up the law so & n b s p ; as to s up er v is e the ma s s me d i a .
I do n ' t need to us e English in da i ly life .
I do n ' t have a strong reason to study English ,
I ' d like to read many b ook s from English co un t ri es in English .
What ever , I ' d like to us e English for my work .

I ' m going to C al if or n i a in this J u ly .
I also want to make friend s with other ex change students and the ho st family !

In the mo v i e , he was very you ng and so fine , so c ut e !
The co ll e g e st ud ent is bu s y ^ ^ ; ( or under g r ad u ate st ud ent )
D o you think that the co ll e g e class is difficult ?
I am ma j or ing in e le c t r ical e ng in e er ing .
But it ' s t ough to keep p a ce with myself .
I was try ing to conc ent r ate on study ing for the ex a m , but the sound of c ic ad as
Besides , it was re ally hot to day .
There f or e , I de c id ed to go to the l i b r ar y and then I made a good pro g re s s .
I am now bu s y with the comp ut er ex a m in ation , which will take place this S at ur day morning .
I s c an n ed the b ook this after no on , and found that it was b or ing and not re le v ant to da i ly life .
However , as a co ll e g e school st ud ent , I have to a c c um ul ate the ne ce s s ar y c er t if ic ate s to get a good job .

It ' s e as ies t to listen to English in m us ic , es pe c i ally the B e at le s and The C ar p ent er s .
( Some m us ic is im po s s i ble to listen to though ) . It ' s second e as ies t to listen to English on the ra d i o .
I of ten listen to J - w a ve in my c ar ( a H on d a F it ) .
The ra d i o person al it ies on the pro g r a m m e are very friend ly and polite , which mean s we can easily listen without get ting off en d ed , but some time s I do n ' t like their good y two sh o es at t it ud es .
A t first , I not ic ed his f a m il i ar face when I was going to bu y under w e ar at U N I Q U L O , the large st a p p ar el comp an y in J a p an , but I was n ' t con f id ent that he was my old friend .
B e c a us e I have n ' t me t him since my j un i or high school gradua tion .
I did not write da ir ies for almost a week because I was la z y . ( I am not going to say B U S Y ) My previous English t ut or told me to never us e B U S Y as the ex c us e to po st po ne something , because no matter how bu s y you are , mi ll ion s people will be bu s i er than you such as p re s id ent s , C E O s , ce le b ri t ies and a l ot of people .
I went to the C h in e se me d ic in e ho s p it al last T h u , help ed my J a p an e se friend to find a sweet room on F ri , set up the in ter ne t and went to a d ar t s b ar with him on S at , play ed be a ch v o l ly b a ll and fool ed around with some new friend s at a beautiful be a ch in the no r th T a i w an on S un day .
How do I become a b e t ter English speak er ?
It ' s just a matter of ( keep ing ) p r a c t ic e .
To day , I got a day off and went to see the c ir c us with my family .
The c ir c us has run every sea s on in this are a
from ( since ) when I was a ch il d .
I have never see n it l ive ( or `` a live perform ance `` ) because I could have see n ( see ) it on T V
A c t u ally , the live c ir c us was interest ing ,
My d aught er ' s pleasure was the be st for me from this show .
But if some on e as k s me to go again , I w o n ' t go even ( if ? ) I pay .
R e c ent ly I have been a b it la z y . . .
de c ent : H is father want ed him to get a de c ent education , so his family mo v ed from his country .
in no c ent : He tri ed to pro ve his in no c ence , but no one believe d what he said .
sen s it ive : She said her s k in is sen s it ive to every st im ul i , so she does n ' t want to go on a hi ke .
serious : I thought she was j o k ing , but when I looked at her face , it was quite serious so I re al i z ed she was tell ing the tru th .
no ble : I think every person need s something no ble in their life .
bra ve : My friend said I ' m bra ve , but I could n ' t find any bra ve qu al it ies in myself .
I wonder if the us age of `` serious `` a b o ve is c or re c t . It is ! = )
T h an k you for always writing commen t s .
I ' m ha p p y and study them .
I think that it is difficult to always think in English .
B e c a us e I want to study a b ro ad some day , I ' ll do my be st .
It is n ic e , because I can study and le ar n new w or d s .
I enjoy life every day .
I started le ar n ing e ng l ish . re c ent ly
English is very difficult to me , but I enjoy le ar n ing .
T w o di ar ies in one day .
I always write a di ar y t w ic e a day .
B e c a us e I write in K or e an and in L an g - 8 .
E ver y day . ! ! !
well , some time s I for g e t to write in k or e an .
He he - _ - ;
D ur ing sp r ing b re a k , I would go to be d around 3 a .
m and sleep ti ll 1 p . m .
The new se m est er will start next week and some of my class es will begin at 1 1 a . m .
It ' s a sh ame to let them pass me by because of over s le e p ing .
So I have been w a k ing up at 8 a .
It ' s not easy for me to w a ke up e ar ly and some time s I feel an ir re st it i ble ur g e to sleep d ur ing the day , but still I man age to get out of be d by at least 8 a .
I have an a p po in t ment to me e t my bo s s at my new job tomorrow a b it l ate at night .
I will fight to keep myself a w a ke tomorrow ! !
The pack age includ ed an electronic di ction ar y that I b or r ow ed from her a long time a g o .
I had for g ot ten to return it , but she s ud d en ly called me and asked for it to be return ed .
So I found it in my desk and she sen t it with some so u ve n ir s .
I called my mo m and let her know it was sen t by my w if e this morning .
A fter I finish ed my work , I me t a friend who is me m b er of the same English c ir c le .
She has a l ot of D V D s which at last co un t was over 2 0 0 !
I in t ro d u c ed her to L an g - 8 .
I said it was good for study ing .
Then we went for a little dr in k and had a good time talk ing .
She said she want ed to begin study ing an English ra d i o pro g r a m .
So we will study the same pro g r a m and comp ar e what we le ar n t every week .
It started ra in ing just as I got home by b ic y c le .
Yes ter day , I b ough t a great de al of ri p en ed to m at o es .
I should or , act u ally , I have to study hard this week - end , but you know , there ' s always some stuff that catch es my at ten tion more than study ing .
What is H a p p i ness ? P ar t 2
While I was listen ing to her story , I was look ing at my dinner that had already became co l d .
B o th of us were n ' t eat ing .
She some time s express ed her tea r s and s i g h ed .
A c t u ally , I listen ed to her since I could n ' t en c o ur age her .
However , I listen ed to her story s il ent ly .
A ll I could do was to gr i p her hand s .
To tell you to the tru th , I re ally want ed to hu g her , but I could n ' t because I did n ' t want to surprise her .
H u g g ing is n ' t a part of J a p an e se c ul ture .
That ' s life . : (
It is c he a p er to play now comp ar ed with before .
T h ough the or i g in s of go l f are un c le ar , it see m s that she p h er d s knock ing stone s into ra b b it ho le s is an est a b l ish ed the or y .
If it had been kept that way , it would co st nothing , right ?
A n y way , I re ally want to see T i g er play go l f .
It is ra in ing hard to day .
In J a p an , there are a l ot of ty p h o on s in S ept e m b er .
I am w or ri ed about get ting back home .
The train will probab ly have to stop .
My in ter p re ter ' s class was so t ough for me last less on .
The them e was about so c i al part ic i p ation in J a p an .
One of my class m ate s made a present ation about how J a p an is str u g g ling and f a c ing t ough e c on o m ic time s as well as po l it ical is s u es .
F or the past twenty year s , sp e c i ally middle - a g ed me n in particular have had many a b il it ies and p ri v i le g es .
They could con t ro l all of J a p an .
However they do n ' t have enough a b il it ies and public ity now .
So , we need to get a second w in d .
In the future more people who are w ome n , no n - re s id ence and you th should part ic i p ate in any so c i al mo ve ment s .
It should be better than now .
That them e felt a b st r a c t for me .
I thought she should have f o c us ed more on the conc re te de ta il s .
We are , natural ly , always look ing for the be st me th o d , the f a st est way , the e as ies t p a th to m aster ing English , J a p an e se , S p an ish , what ever ish . . .
On the other hand , good me th o d s [ As s im il ? ] when us ed wrong can pro d u ce poor re s ul t s .
In the end , what you should know , what you should [ at least you should . . . ] not ic e by your s el f is that there is n ' t A S I N G L E M E T H O D for language le ar n ing .
E a ch st ud ent has to find his own me th o d , his own way of le ar n ing .
O f course , this is n ' t an easy thing to do .
I know some things work and some do n ' t , but to find out ex a c t ly how to do it is n ' t that easy .
A ll me th o d s have good and bad point s , so what you have to do is not ic e the good point s and us e them in your own way .
O f course I ' m being a b it the at r ical , but I just want to show that there is n ' t one me th o d that r ul es over all other s .
If you work hard on it , you probab ly will not only find out which le ar n ing me th o d s and str ate g ies s u it you better , but you also will start to not ic e some un ive r s al p r in c i p le s about language le ar n ing .
The a ver age language le ar n er , who usual ly follow s just one me th o d s ( like many English teachers here in B r a z il who have t aught English us ing the same me th o d for more than 2 0 year s ) , will probab ly not le ar n the se p r in c i p le s and , there f or e , become kind of limit ed when it come s to how to le ar n a language .
We had a very good time play ing a cha s ing game in the water .
I ' m very ha p p y to see that my d aught er started to have more con f id ence in the water because she could n ' t put her face in the water before she went to s w im m ing less on s .
She was even s c ar ed of get ting a sp l ash on her face when she had a show er .
No w she can do a head st and in the water !
As her school will have s w im m ing less on s start ing soon , ho pe ful ly she will have no pro ble m in the water and can enjoy s w im m ing with other s .
I can tell the ch l or in e in the po o l was very strong since a sp l ash of the water hu r t my eyes quite a b it .
In addition to that , I felt re ally tired after get ting out of the water al th ough I had n ' t s w um much .
It is already D e ce m b er .

Then , something happen ed .
S ud d en ly `` this fellow `` pass ed by me quick ly !

A fter that , it was back to normal .
No w , it watch es me from the desk .
What a f e ar ful story that was ! !
It is difficult for me to speak and write in English .
And let ' s tell own language to each other ! !
My think ing has come to a stand st i ll .
I have no idea s .
So , there is nothing and nothing again .
Where did my in s p ir ation go ?
I tra ve led with my class 3 days a g o .
A l th ough we were tired every body felt please d .
We took many p h ot o s ; about 7 0 0 .
we went to an is l and , it s name is T h un g N a i and it is a new to ur is t sp ot .
P e op le who live there are friend ly , it has fresh a ir and many f r u it tree s .
A fter this j o ur ne y I understand my friend s better and l o ve them so much .
I think they feel the same way .
To day in Y o k o ha m a it was ra in y , though I had ful f il led my p l an in my previous j o ur n al .
The he a v y feel ing of my body was re l i e v ed by in d o or c l im b ing ex er c is e .
A fter w ar d s , my p al m s k in pe el ed and I could hard ly mo ve my tired body .
But I ' ll have a good night ' s sleep .
I must fight the feel ing of not want ing to go to my office .
I gue s s I ' ll s u f f er m us c le a ch e tomorrow morning .
I ' ve read The S ch e m e T e a m , the 5 th b ook in the C he st n ut H i ll S er ies .
The C he st n ut H i ll S er ies is written by L a ur en B r ook e .
They are 7 th gra d er students in a boarding school for girl s called C he st n ut H i ll .
The school has good ho r se ri d ing pro g r a m s as well as education al pro g r a m s .
They face some difficult ies .
But in each case , they help each other to over c ome the se difficult ies .
In this s er ies , the re l ation s h i p with ho r se s is n ' t so much the ma in to p ic of the story , comp ar ed to the He ar t l and S er ies .
S t i ll the her o in es ' de v o tion to ho r se s is pro m in ent in the story .
The in ter v i e w er s asked us [ 1 8 in ter v i e w e es includ ing me ] to come up with an idea of a new pro d u c t and the mar ke ting str ate g y to make it out st and ing .
I was re ally surprise d but not n er v ous because I take In ter n ation al B us i ness M an age ment at the un ive r s ity .
There had been two in ter v i e w s before I got the in ter n s h i p pro g r a m .
M or e o ver , one of the new e m p l o y e es who had just come to work only two week s before told me to finish his work of a 1 9 p age translation with in 2 week s .
And to comp o se 1 7 English v o c a b ul ar y po e m s for a S A T course .
I was and still am in f ur i at ed with the way they treat an in ter n s h i p st ud ent .
I get only 1 0 0 B a h t per day , which is about 3 do ll ar s a day !
My so n
It ' s been two days since I re g is ter ed at this sit e
What a great sit e !
A n y way , I have a one - year - old bo y .
He c a n ' t talk at all yet , but he always say s `` O h ! `` .
When ever he find s something ( a do g , a light , a but t on , e t c . . . ) , he say s `` O h ! `` .
He dis c o ver s something every day like an in v ent or .
I w o ke up f e w minute s a g o .
I have a meeting to day , so there work that I have to do .
I ' m re ally l ate .
A F i re w or k D is p la y !
I went to a f i re w or k d is p la y on A u g ust 7 .
It was he l d near the sea at my home t ow n .
A bout ten th ous and of f i re w or k s were set off .
I went there we ar n ing a y u k at a with my friend s .
B o th of them were de l ic i ous !
A fter that , I watch ed the f i re w or k s .
They were wonder ful and I was ex cited ! !
H a ve you ever see n the mo v i e `` This is it `` ?
In J a p an , the mo v i e got to No . 1 on a week ly mo v i e cha r t .
A l ot of my friend s have see n `` This is it `` and all of them have been ent h us i a st ic about M ic he al J a c k s on .
I ' ve also been a M ic ha el J a c k s on f an at ic since I was a te en age r , but I c a n ' t go see the mo v i e because I have to take care of my two you ng ch il d re n with my w if e . . .
B T W , I can do the dance s in M ic he al J a c k s on ' s m us ic v id e o s , like `` T h ri ll er , `` `` B i ll i e J e an , `` and `` S m o o th C ri m in al `` .
I will tea ch the dance of `` T h ri ll er `` to my friend who is a dance c l u b me m b er .
I made a G M , which appear s in J a p an e se an im ation `` M o b i le S u it G un d a m . `` I like this ro b ot .
It is also f un to pai n t different ly from the original ver s ion .
Yes ter day , I sub m it ted my gradua tion the s is .
I thought that sub m it ting it was the same as the c er t if ic ation of my gradua tion since my the s is was already c he c k ed by my p rofessor .
But in fact , I understood that in M ar ch I have to take an or al ex a m in ation .
I ' m a little dis a p po in ted with this .
I had p l an n ed how to sp en d my ho l i day . . .
The days I have to study will con t in u e . .
J P are too n er v ous to s ur v ive !
and let them go a b ro ad for one year or so ! !
I sympath i z e with that way of think ing ,
I part ic i p at ed in a train ing works h op for sp or t s or th op ed ic s .
E a ch do c t or spoke about `` k ne e pro ble m s `` .
The con t ent of the speech es interest ed me .
I was es pe c i ally interest ed in the speech about `` mo ve ment of an a ly s is `` .
may b e I c aught a co l d : (
I think that may b e I c aught a co l d .
U s u ally I ' m the one who always comp la in s about the a ir - condition er in my office .
I always feel hot and I always shout `` It ' s too hot `` at my co ll e a gue s , but now I have to turn off the a ir - condition er .
I sit near the w in d ow so it ' s the hot t est place in the room but now al th ough the s k y is full of s un s h in e and all the he at is coming through the w in d ow I do n ' t feel any w ar m er .
I have to take some me d ic in e first before a re al co l d catch es me ( ^ _ _ ^ )
This is my first time writing an ar t ic le us ing English !
I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent in J a p an !
I like b a k ing sweet s , going on tri p s , listen ing to m us ic , and play ing in st r u ment s .
I can play a g u it ar and a p i an o .
And I l o ve J a p an e se c ul ture so I am le ar n ing about the J a p an e se tea ce re m on y .
I want to work in a for e i g n country in the future : )
I ' m a st ud ent of the de p ar t ment of history . However , I must le ar n more than that . S u ch as in ter n ation al re l ation s , English , and J a p an e se .
E ver y day , I study those four as pe c t s from 7 : 0 0 to 2 2 : 0 0 .
And I always have no time to do any other s .
some on e told me I must speak English very well .
I need friend and I need people to be con t ent with me . However , people do n ' t like me . A t le a st this is what I think .
who can help me or tell me what can I do ?
My A n x i e ty
He had se c re t ly s m o k ed with his friend s .
H is teacher came to our house .
He told me what had happen ed .
This is the first time that I have heard of their mi s b e ha v i or .
I thought my so n want ed to es c a pe from being for c ed to study by me .
I re f le c ted on myself a l ot and said to him ,
`` You do not have to study so much , so you should stay home . ``
I have heard the sound of them walk ing on the ro o f .
One day I heard a voice in his room so I open ed the do or to his room .
Then , I saw two bo y s hi d ing behind the bu n k be d .
I as s er ted to them about a f e w things .
I am sorry that you do not keep the pro m is es you made with me about not s m o k ing and study ing hard er .
What should I do ?
This is my first time to us e this sit e .
So I would like to co m m un ic ate with who ever want s to ( speak with me ) .
I ten d to believe in g h o st s because I was b or n in small town .
The p op ul ation of my town was l ow .
My ne i g h b or ' s house was old so it was easily b ro k en when a ty p h o on come s to our re g ion .
B e f or e I tri ed to sleep at night , I always went to the re st ro o m where I can see their house .
I could n ' t do anything because I was a kid .
I called my mo m : `` He y , I found a c ock ro a ch so please k i ll them . ``
`` co m ' on mo m ! ``
`` hu r ry up ! ``
I of ten us ed something like that .
My high school year s ( 4 )
They ent er tain ed me near ly through all of gra d e 2 .
O f course , I was w or ri ed about my be ha v i or when I was found enjoy ing them .
They f in ally found out .
I was s us p en d ed to make a s el f - ex a m in ation . ?
A t the begin n ing , though , I found that I could not catch up with my less on s , for I had mi s s ed so many less on s .
B e c a us e of this , it took me four year s to finish the three - year j un i or high school .
She like s the new ho s p it al because the do c t or explain s to her well .
It ' s at a very easy le ve l .
I heard it ' s good to read many b ook s in a s u it able le ve l .
No w , the number of w or d s I can read is 2 666 w or d s .
5 th g en er ation i P o d n an o
I b ough t a 5 th g en er ation i P o d n an o last D e ce m b er .
So it is not easy for me to us e A p p le pro d u c t s .
I can im p or t m us ic into my i P o d n an o but c a n ' t understand the way to im p or t any picture s .
F in ally , to day , I found out how to im p or t some picture s into it !
I am very ha p p y about being able to do that .
I had a very bu s y day to day . I had two class es , c he c k ed students ' not e b ook s and there was a business tri p .
I was going to go to con ver s ation al English class , but the English teacher c aught a co l d yesterday , so to day ' s less on was c ance led .
I went to a M e x ic an re st a ur ant , `` E l To ri t o `` to night and at e E n ch il ad a , S al s a ch i p s , C e as er s al ad , and ic e c re a m and dr an k a M ar g ar it a which was f ro z en with a s al t f r ing e around the g la s s .
I like M ar g ar it as very much , but it s al c o h o l le ve l is kind of high , so I ' m always get ting sleep y after dr in k ing .
There are many t v s c re en s ha ng ing on the wall and the t v cha n n el is always sp or t s cha n n el `` E S P N . `` To day ' s sp or t was b a se b a ll .
f o ot b a ll sea s on will start in A u g ust . . . . .
so now all that we can watch is b a se b a ll game s and ho c ke y game s .
To day is G u y F a w ke s N i g h t ( or bo n f i re night ) in O x f or d .
A l th ough it is off ic i ally the f if th of No ve m b er , the even t is to be he l d S at ur day night this year .
L a st year my w if e and I went to the bo n f i re he l d at So u th P ar k .
A l th ough it was a co l d night , the large p ar k was full of people .
G u y F a w ke s tri ed to blow up P ar l i a ment in or d er to k i ll K ing J ame s I of E ng l and and V I of S c ot l and , but f a il ed and was ar re st ed on the f if th of No ve m b er in 1 6 0 5 .
The f a il ed as s as s in ation attempt is now know n as the g un p ow d er p l ot .
F or some reason , the B ri t ish have been ce le b r at ing this day with a bo n f i re and f i re w or k s for more than 4 0 0 year s .
I ' m not even sure that the B ri t ish are in f a v o ur of or are against G u y F a w ke s himself and his p l ot .
In my opinion , most of them may be tak ing a d v ant age of his f a il ed attempt as a reason / ex c us e to enjoy f i re w or k s .
F or me as a J a p an e se , f i re w or k s on a co l d a ut um n night are very un us u al and is quite a s ur re al ex pe ri ence , since f i re w or k s are ic on s of the hot t est s um m er sea s on in J a p an , re m in d ing me the hu m id ity and hot a ir , girl s we ar ing y u k at a ( by the way , girl s with y u k at a look 3 0 % more at t r a c t ive and p re t t i er than usual ) , k a k i g or i ( c r us h ed ic e with f r u it - f la v o ur ed s y r up ) , and so on .
When a B ri t ish `` guy `` visit s J a p an and see f i re w or k s f est i v al s in s um m er , what would he think / how would he feel ?
D r ow s i ness
I stay ed up all night last night , and so I am ter ri b ly sleep y to day .
However , I do it any way .
B e c a us e dr ow s i ness ha r m s study , it is ne ce s s ar y to take care .
In most school s in J a p an there is va c ation d ur ing s um m er .
But I must go to school tomorrow .
O ur school start s va c ation at the end of this week .
I am look ing for w ar d to it very much .
P a c k er s v . s . F al c on s
One of the di v is ion play - off s is `` P a c k er s v . s . F al c on s `` .
The F al c on s have be a ten the P a c k er s this sea s on .
This c l i p tell s me that the next game will be too close to call .
This mo v i e ' s or i g in is the gra p h ic no ve l `` W A T C H M E N `` , written by A l an M o or e , i ll ust r at ed by D a ve G i b b on s .
I can say , `` W A T C H M E N `` cha ll e ng es the read er ' s mind .
What is e v il ?
What is just ic e ?
What is hu man ity ?
We can be all ow ed to s a c ri f ic e some on e to s a ve the world ?
I ' ve had no time to write on L an g - 8 .
I ' m writing on L an g - 8 for the first time in a month .
I went to S h i g a p re f e c ture last week , and stay ed at B i w a k o H ot el be s id e a la ke .
A t night , I watch ed the ha r ve st mo on .
I comp le te ly for g ot about a l ot of work .
Then he begin s c l im b ing the s ta ir s .
I study English almost every day .
But I ' m not good at English .
There f or e , I want to le ar n to read , write and speak English .
B y the way , I have a T w it ter account .
I went out to a Ya k it or i re st a ur ant with my co ll e gue after work last night .
It was so hot d ur ing the day , so I want ed to go to a re st a ur ant in which a ir condition ing works .
When we stood in front of the do or of that re st a ur ant , we found the do or was open .
I had a feel ing that what I did n ' t ho pe for would now happen .
D u e to the hot at m o s p he re I could dr in k much more be er .
I felt more co m f or t able as w in d some time s ble w into the re st a ur ant .
As you might know , the Ya k it or i is a p op ul ar J a p an e se f o o d .
It is made from s ever al b ite - s i z ed piece s of ch ic k en me at , or ch ic k en off al , s ke w er ed on a B a m b o o s ke w er and b ar b e c u ed .
It is serve d with s al t or with `` T ar e `` s a u ce , which is g en er ally made up of mi r in , s a ke , so y s a u ce and s u g ar .
Yes ter day I went to a f a m ous for t un e tell er .
She is in H ar a j u ku Tokyo and is called `` M o ther of H ar a j u ku `` .
I always in qu i re about my job , my mar ri age and my he al th .
She said that I ' ll me e t my de st in ed woman next sp r ing ! !
I ' m look ing for w ar d to meeting her .
I just have a question :
How do you say T O and F R O M in J a p an e se
O r when you give a g if t ?
I write in my di ar y on L an g - 8 in English for the first time .
So , I try to write in my di ar y to le ar n how to us e English .
I write in my di ar y every day as much as I can / as much as possible .
To day , I went to a re st a ur ant to eat o k on o m i y a k i with my friend s .
I could eat as much as I want ed .
However , I at e too much and have a so re st o m a ch .
I ' m study ing the im m un e s y s te m now .
I will explain about my re se ar ch in more de ta il some day .
I pass ed the qu al if ic ation ex a m , `` E i k en , P re - one gra d e `` a f e w month s a g o .
a p p l ic ant s , so I think that is why they ' re going to hold this s amp le t est .
In the se month s , I have not been a di l i g ent st ud ent .
I ' m always bu s y the se days !
The se days I ' m always bu s y because school has started .
S in ce school started , I do n ' t have much time to do anything I want to do .
U n f or t un ate ly , the only thing that I have time for is study ing , study ing , and more study ing .
We are all going c r a z y now .
This year my teachers are funny . A l s o , I have j o in ed a mo d er n dr a m a c l u b .
D r a m a c l u b is funny and ex c it ing .
My new life , is full of ha p p i ness and f un time s .
But my life is also full of p re s s ur e .
So , I need to study hard now .
I b ough t some st ock s last O c t .
S in ce then , I ' ve been re ally interest ed in e c on o m ic s .
The e c on o m ic s in J a p an is easily affect e ed by that of for e i g n co un t ri es ( es pe c i ally U S ) .
O f course not only J a p an , many co un t ri es ' e c on o m ic s are affect ed by other co un t ri es ' e c on o m ic s .
No w , in my country , many people were f ir ed , and what is w or se , it ' s difficult for any on e to find new job .
There ' s al ot of bad new s like this now . . .
However , do n ' t you think the re l ation s h i p of e c on o m ic s between one country and another is interest ing ?
I think it ' s still too e ar ly for me to talk about e c on o m ic s in English .
S in ce I ' d like to know about the se place s as much as possible , I am read ing g u id e b ook s and c he c k ing the in ter ne t every day .
I H a ve B e c ome A w ar e
R e c ent ly , I ' ve become a w ar e that it ' s not easy to e ar n money .
We never e ar n money at the time of work ing .
M a y b e there are some job s that can get l ot s of money a day .
But I do n ' t think they are a b s o l ut e ly good job s .
H a ve a n ic e day ! !
It is a n ic e we a ther to day !
I like such a day .
I had only a class on man age ment to day . It was b or ing ,
It mean s that the f in al - ex a m s are coming soon .
M a y b e I go n n a turn c r a z y . . . . .
But I am not in the mo o d to study . . . . I am so la z y . . . . . .
B y the way I am about to leave for home
To day my co ll e g e will hold an even t ! I think it will be f un !
This even t is he l d once a year .
I could me e t a l ot of friend s ! I am very ex cited !
This story sha ll con t in u e la ter . . . . . . . .
I c ook ed two ha m b ur g er dis he s yesterday .
I was going to play ten n is in the after no on .
But what make s the se two v id e o s to t ally different ?
When the s un sh in es , I will hold your hand and to g e ther we will walk along the street s .
To day I ' d like to tell a story about a dr un k who los t his ke y s .
It ' s a f a m ous j o ke , so you may have heard it
I think it is a simple story but it tea ch es us im p or t ant less on about our life .
One night , a man go es out to dr in k at a l o c al b ar .
A fter saying good b y e to his friend s , he begin s walk ing home , s ing ing ha p p i ly
As he is get ting close to his a p ar t ment , he take s his ke y s out of his pocket but dr op s them on the gr ound in the dark .
On ce he re al i z es his ke y s are mi s s ing , he w and er s around a street l amp and begin s look ing for them
I had a trouble with my English .
T h ough I have been le ar n ing English for a long time .
I knew my pro ble m was that I c ound ' t catch the mean ing what people had said , and my pro n un c i ation was too bad .
I want ed to be able to m aster English con ver s ation , but I sp ent most of the time study ing gra m m ar and even I tri ed to read new s p a p er and no ve l s .
A ll study are help ful , but some of them are not effect ive .
It is im p or t ant for me to know what I want and f o c us on it .
J a p an e se come d i an s some time s p ar o d y the for e i g n er ' s way of speak ing J a p an e se .
The way they do this is by o m it ting part ic le s , in c or re c t a c c ent and into n ation and it see m s that they can be c ate g or is ed by n ation al it ies .
I suppose this may be tru e from my ex pe ri ence s and a c ut ally English ch il d re n le ar n n ur se ry r h y m es by language a c qu is i tion .
O ther w is e , if J a p an e se le ar n er s mi m ic k ed their r h y th m , even if it was strange J a p an e se , they might o b tain the s k i ll to speak natural ly .
J un z o Ka w ad a is a re se ar ch er in c ul t ur al an th ro po l o g y and he went to A f ri c a to re se ar ch a tri b e who se language does not have letter s .

What are the most p op ul ar English we b s ite s ?
W h i ch of them are the ma j or ity of English m en / A m er ic an s visit ing every day ?
The be st would be those with interest ing con t ent s , new s , or sit es about s c i ence , comp ut er s c i ence e t c .
I want to im p ro ve my ability to write in English .
I finish ed my work a little e ar l i er than usual and b ough t a b ir th day c a ke for her on the way back home .
O ur old est so n had a head a ch e d ur ing the day time .
To day , I read a ma g a z in e about en v ir on ment .
The ma g a z in e is N A T I O N A L G E O G R A P H I C .
I was impress ed by an ar t ic le written about j e t man .
He f le w by j e t e ng in e , which made the man a b ir d .
so he was called B ir d man .
I think that the hu man dr e a m is to f ly in the s k y , and I en v y him .

It make s me ha p p y .
Yes ter day I was not ha p p y .
I went to my gradua te school by bu s .
On the way back home it was ra in ing even more .
I got on the bu s .
A fter I sat down , I c he c k ed my wall e t .
O h my go d !
I had a b i ll of five th ous and yen , but I did n ' t have any change .
The far e of the bu s was 2 2 0 yen .
On most J a p an e a se bu se s , you c a n ' t get change .
He said he did n ' t have any change .
I asked him what should I do .
He said I could go without pay ing the far e , but next time I get on the bu s I you should tell the dr ive r this story , and pay the far e then .
I than k ed him , and got off the bu s .
On the way home from the bu s stop I got so a k ing we t .
H i every on e , n ic e to me e t you .
B e c a us e G un m a is not a f a m ous like Tokyo , and K ir y u is in that p re f e c ture ' s country s id e .
I had to pay for e le c t ri c ity and In ter ne t .
In T an z an i a , almost everything is an a d v ance pay ment s y s te m while everything is a la ter pay ment in K or e a .
He re , I us e a p re p a id e le c t ri c ity s y s te m called L U K U .
I have to bu y v o u ch er first if I want to us e e le c t ri c ity .
( I ' m not sure whether v o u ch a is an English w or d or not . ) ( v o u ch er is c or re c t )
in case of mo b i le p h on e and In ter ne t and so on . . . . .
I could n ' t us e in ter ne t d ur ing last week en d be a us e my in ter ne t va l id per i o d was over on last F ri day .

I b ough t some f r u it and a bo t t le of w in e on my way to town .
I also b ough t a w in e g la s s to dr in k / for dr in k ing w in e .
I dr an k a g la s s of w in e and I felt so good .
I may look like an al c o h o l ic : - (
We have a good time there , because our house is big g er than our old house that we live d in a month a g o .
It is not n ation al a sp or t ,
but we can watch every ma t ch on N H K n ation al T V b ro ad c a st .
In J a p an , s um o ma t ch es are he l d 6 time s per year .
The f est i v al s on o d d number month s are he l d in to k y o ,
and even one ' s are in other are as such as O s a k a N a o y a and K y us y u .
last S un day , the f est i v al in O s a k a began .
It is called `` H ar u - b as y o `` which mean s sp r ing sea s on .
R e c ent ly , we can see for e i g n s um o w re st l er s , es pe c i ally from mo ng o l i a .
If he w in s the ch amp ion s h i p this sea s on , he will be se le c ted as `` O z e k i `` .
I had p l an n ed to go s k i ing with my family this week en d ,
but I c ance led when we heard about this dis aster .
It would have been the first time for my ch il d re n to go s k i ing .
R e c ent ly I ' ve had in s o m n i a .
I ' ve felt very tired .
What should I do ?
ne c k is st if f and back is so re too .
What is the di f f er ence between `` can `` and `` k in `` ?
To day ' s W or k
I have to make a do c u ment by F ri day .
I finish ed ma k ing the do c u ment to day .
M e and my s ta f f visit ed one c l i ent and had a meeting with them .
In that meeting , there was a hard ne g ot i ation between us and the c l i ent .
We dis c us s ed about how to op er ate this de al .
F in ally , we set the d ate of our next meeting and agree d on our next point s to dis c us s .
P o ll en is blow ing every where .
It become s w ar m and con f or t able to go outside .
P o ll en give s me ha y f ever .
When I was look ing up the w or d ' a g it ate ' in di ction ar y , I found an ex amp le which con f us ed me .
A big mo s qu it o has b it ten me !
There ' s a mo s qu it o in my room .
It look s very big .
He already b it me a co up le time s when I was tak ing a n a p .
I do n ' t want him to live all night long . . .
My friend who is J a p an e se can listen care ful ly th i er sound and then he can tell if they are ma le or f e m al e .
I think that if they are ma le , they do n ' t want ( to b ite me / my b l o o d ) .
I c a n ' t do the same as my friend .
But I think the mo s qu it o in my room is f e m al e .
B e c a us e it b it me in two place s .
I am it ch y now . . . .
On our pro j e c t meeting , we talk about what each person try ing next week .
A n y way , we have kind of a strange c ust o m for ch ri st m as .
E at ing K F C ch ic k en is one of the ex amp le for our un i qu e c ust o m for ch ri st m as .
My c ous in said my di ar ies always are so short , but I do n ' t know what I can write in the di ar y .
M o s qu it o es like this we a ther .
They f ly into the house when some on e open s the do or .
I am on a train on the way to my un ive r s ity .
When ever I ' m on a train , I o b s er ve people in there , es pe c i ally those who are on the op po s ite sea t from where I ' m sit ting .
A bout 1 0 people can sit down on the sea t , but I can see 5 people at first sight .
No w , three girl s are play ing with their mo b il es and two old guy s are sleep ing .
A h , the train ar ri v ed at the st ation , so I have to change train s .
As I w ro te on this di ar y on No ve m b er 4 th , one of our man age r s ga ve a le c ture on co st man age ment .
The me as ur e to de al with the f al ling b ir th r ate
D P J ' s ma in po l ic y to co m b at the f al ling b ir th r ate is by g i v ing 2 6 0 0 0 y en per ch il d per month to p ar ent s .
I think that it ' s not enough and not a good po l ic y .
I read an e c on o m is t opinion in the paper that said `` B i g comp an ies should set up day - care c ent er s for ch il d re n . `` The same paper said that It o ch u , a f a m ous tra d ing comp an y , set up a day - care c ent er .
A ccord ing to the ar t ic le , M it s u i B us s an and S um it o m o S h o j i , which are also f a m ous tra d ing comp an ies , already have their day - care c ent er s .
I think & n b s p ; that comp an ies having their own day - care c ent er is very good idea , and a very good me as ur e to address the f al ling b ir th r ate .
M o st of the father s or mother s would go to day - care c ent er s on their way to the office and they take more time for co m m ut ing .
But if their comp an y has a day - care c ent er they can go to their office with their ch il d re n without time con s um ing de t o ur s .
If a day - care c ent er is near their office , they can easily go there to watch their ch il d ' s life .
So I wish many more comp an ies would set up their own day - care c ent er s near their office and many people can easily have both a care er and ch il d re n .
I will start my di ar y .
R e c ent ly , It has been very hot ! !
then I tri ed to sleep again .
It was too ti r ing to do in the morning .
I ' m work ing at a d mission c ent er of a un ive r s ity in J a p an .
I do n ' t like office work , but my co ll e a gue s are very funny .
so I can keep on work ing there .
O ur bo s s give s us ic e c re a m some time s .
but I have de c id ed to go a b ro ad or take part in work ing ho l i day next year .
that ` s it for to day .
I have to study English more .
If you go and look at the mo on , it appear s to mo ve with you .
And , if you ' ll look at it care ful ly , you might not ic e that it has a hu man ' s face : a no se , raise d e y e b r ow s , a l o ve ly smile . . .
One dark night , I r a D m it ri e v a was coming home , but the mo on ' s smile was n ' t l o ve ly for her .
On the con t r ar y , the mo on seemed to tell her : `` You ' ll see how you will be me t at home .
`` It ' s very l ate . ``
I r a looked at the gr ound and thought : `` If only my p ar ent s were sleep ing ! ``
She want ed to b l ame some on e , but she knew that she could n ' t .
I r a looked quick ly at the w in d ow s of her f l at on the f if th floor .
M u ch to I r a ' s dis m a y , there was a light on inside .
`` What should I tell them ?
I r a re m e m b er ed how her mo m ' s voice sound ed when she was a ng ry .
I r a was very s c ar ed .
I watch ed a mo v i e called , `` B ro k en English `` alone yesterday .
I got a day off s ud d en ly and I wonder ed what I would do .
Even t u ally , I watch ed it but it was re ally b or ing .
It was about a lady who f a ll s in l o ve with a F re n ch man .
I thought he could n ' t speak English f l u ent ly which was the reason of the ti t le , but he could .
He only made one mistake , and it was mi x ing up a ng ry and hung ry .
He said he was hung ry , but she re al i z ed that he was a ng ry .
It was re ally funny because his English was re ally f l u ent .
I have finish ed two line draw ing ( hand m ad e s ke t ch es on paper ) , I am going to co l or it in class tomorrow , so teacher could c or re c t me s im ul ta ne ous ly .
she went to see a do c t or in a big ho s p it al .
And yesterday , she came back with the re s ul t .
The re s ul t of the b l o o d t est and C T s c an were all normal .
A c t u ally , she had ter ri ble con st i p ation . . . .
B e c a us e of my do u b t s I re se ar ch ed something about this to p ic on the in ter ne t and I dis c o ver ed that for some people it ' s not easy .
but I think this t est would last five minute s !
The ch amp ion s le a gue ' s 2 n d le g of the qu ar ter f in al s were he l d yesterday and to day .
In the qu ar ter f in al s , R a ul , who be l on g s to S ch al ke , got the go al s in the 1 st le g and the 2 n d le g , which ga ve me go o se p um p s .
I start ( started ) la ng - 8 to day .
I ' ve been think ing about why I want to study English .
And to night I got a part of the answer .
I have a feel ing that it is different from every body else ' s ( reason ) .
But every body has a reason why they want to study second la un g u age .
I want to study hard so I can explain my answer .
I was a ch il d when I first watch ed this mo v i e .
It was am a z ing , the story line in particular .
In the last scene of this mo v i e , D o c d ropped an im p or t ant c able from the ro o f of the school many time s .
I almost de st ro y ed the T V in a ng er .
I can im a g in e , after this mo v i e re le as ed , many A m er ic an kid s play ed with s k ate b o ar d s on the ro ad .
I think the be st way s to le ar n K or e an are the same as English .
The be st way to p r a c t ic e listen ing is watch ing K or e an dr a m as or mo v ies .
I will give you one .
R e ad out loud even though you do n ' t understand the mean ing s .
E ver y day , read K or e an b ook s out loud , you will even t u ally m aster it .
If you do n ' t have a friend to talk to , you can talk to me through s k y pe .
M a y b e , you can speak in K or e an to your family , even though they do n ' t understand it .
It is good p r a c t ic e .
I think this is the hard est one .
The be st way is to write some things on this we b s ite and as k n at ive K or e an s to c or re c t them .
I , act u ally , ha ted study ing English when I was in high school .
My C o ll e g e ' s A n n ive r s ar y C e le b r ation s
A p ri l 1 8 th is a sp e c i al day .
It ' s just one day away , and the co ll e g e will be bu st ling with no is e and ex c ite ment , I think .
I will be bu s y receiv ing for m er students [ 1 ] on that day , because many of them are look ing for w ad to re v is it ing their old co ll e g e . [ 2 ]
Some of them have a ch i e v ed great success in so c i e ty , so they want to see how their for m er un ive r s ity [ 1 ] has de ve l op ed in re c ent year s .
My co ll e g e has had a sp le n d id 5 0 - year history .
S in ce I entered it in 2 0 0 7 , it has de ve l op ed great ly .
It s full name is J i an g x i U n ive r s ity of T r ad i tion al C h in e se M ed ic in e .
H a ve you ever gradua ted from un ive r s ity ?
T e ll me something about your co ll e g e . [ 2 ]
D r an k with my C o - work er s .
Yes ter day , I went to dr in k with my co - work er s in an I Z A K A Y A .
I sp ent a f e w hour s read ing e - ma il s .
I could n ' t finish all of my work to day , but I can take another va c ation for this week en d .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to get ting the va c ation .
I need a certain am o un t of salary to s up p or t my family , however my c ur r ent salary is not good .
So yesterday , I looked at some job hu n ting we b s ite s .
D o n ' t as k me `` Why did n ' t you wait to get mar ri ed unti l you had a high pay ing job ? `` A t that time I was very de s p er ate to set t le down in S ing a po re .
N e ed less to say , speak ing a for e i g n language like a n at ive speak er is almost im po s s i ble for every on e ex c ept n at ive b il ing u al s .
But for me , `` business English `` sound s like . . . `` almost per f e c t English . `` As far as I can see , S u ch s up er J a p an e se work er s do n ' t ex is t .
A re there many J a p an e se people who can speak English like n at ive speak er s some where in S ing a po re some where that I do n ' t know yet ?
What the he c k is business English ?
L a st night my friend told me about L an g - 8 , and I think it is very good for study ing English . .
I wish to make friend s with you guy s . . .
To day is a beautiful and s un n y S at ur day !
I usual ly sp en d my week en d s going sh op p ing or do ing ex er c is es or just re la x ing .
I always think that keep ing an English di ar y is a good way to p r a c t ic e my English s k i ll s .
But , un f or t un ate ly , I some h ow did n ' t do it .
There f or e , I ch o se to j o in L an g - 8 !
It has been 1 year since I came to the U . S .
But even though my English h [ / B L U E ] as not im p ro v ed , one thing that I have felt is that I am not afraid of us ing English any more , even though I could not understand what people said .
In other w or d s , I do not care about the people around me .
I do n ' t know if it is good or bad .
I am still e age r ly wish ing that I could us e English like a n at ive .
S e c on d , I am going sh op p ing .
I ho pe I will have a good week en d , and so will all of you !
A t first , when I did n ' t understand the mean ing s of new w or d s , I looked them up in the di ction ar y .
But , by do ing that , I did n ' t read quick ly .
( If the b ook be l on g ed to me , I read it that way .
I understand the con t ent up to now and will finish read ing by J un . 2 1 .
T h an k you for read ing .
He ll o my name is `` P o b ir on `` , I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent in J a p an .
In the future I would like to us e English in my work .
My friend told me about this we b sit e .
And if you know a good place for my study a b ro ad , please tell me : D
I will go to gradua te school next year .
In J a p an , most gradua te students start look ing for a job in their first year ( ex c ept for those who go for a do c t or ate ) .
I ' d like to ex pe ri ence work ing over se as before look ing for a more per man ent job .
So I ' ll think about tak ing a year off to j o in an in ter n s h i p pro g r a m in E ur o pe .
I w ro te that I of ten l ic k ed my l i p s before .
It ' s called ' B ur t ' s B e es ' . It was b ough t as a so u ve n ir from A m er ic a .
My l i p s now feel en ri ch ed : )
I ' ve not been there for half a year .
It is g en er ally accept ed that our country called J a p an has been in f l u ence d by many great people a cross the country .
I think one f e m al e s ing er is the l ate st great person who pro d u ce s a p ow er ful effect on J a p an .
I would like to write about her im p a c t in this es s a y .
F or ex amp le , she of ten s ing s her own name in her so ng s .
No t only are her so ng s un i qu e , but her fashion sen se is as well .
F or ex amp le , she d y es her ha ir into strange co l o ur s ; w h ite , y e ll ow and gr e en .
He r co st um es are also se x y and un us u al .
R e c ent ly , she w or e a black on ion co st um e when she appeared on `` R o o m of the T e t s u k o `` which is J a p an e se f a m ous T V pro g r a m , because T e t s u k o ' s ha ir style look s like an on ion .
F ur ther m or e , L A D Y G A G A ga ve T e t s u k o can d y that she took out of her sp ir al ha ir .
M an y J a p an e se people were so surprise d .
I went to a b a se b a ll game .
I am a H an s h in T i g er s f an .
I saw some on e w aving J a p an e se f la g s on the ble a ch er s .
No t a pro ble m , but it does n ' t f it with a b a se b a ll game .
No r m ally they us e H an s h in T i g er ' s f la g s .
Then I could see they were a for e i g n er .
Then I understood .
That is what ' s most im p or t ant !
In J a p an e se , N e w year ' s re s o l u tion is called `` H O U F U `` .
M o st of their `` H O U F U `` is about their work .
A t J a p an e se work p la ce ' s part ies , almost every on e talk s about work .
I ' m tired of that to p ic .
h m m . English is easy , but people regard it as difficult .
Why do people think English is very difficult ?
A c t u ally , English is very simple .
W h o make s English difficult ?
English teachers !
They are saying that English is hard for you .
So you need help , such as a friend , teacher , and so on .
This is a lie .
When I ' m de p re s s ed , I feel everything will turn in a bad way .
I c a n ' t con ne c t with my bo y f ri en d , because he is at the part y h ook ing up with some girl s .
One of my friend s have n ' t re p l i ed to my e - ma il because she got in trouble or she does n ' t w an n a talk with me .
I dr e ame d some body in my family will di e and w a ke up c ry ing .
A c t u ally nothing s . bad has happen ed .
How can I w a ke up from this night m ar e here ?
To day , I ga ve a present ation .
I spoke well and con f id ent ly .
I did n ' t get n er v ous at all .
However , I f a il ed to i ll ust r ate the next sub j e c t .
I finish ed the present ation than k s to friend s and our teacher .
I felt I need ed to make l ot s of effort to im p ro ve my English .
Some day I want to give a good present ation like the other students .
A fter the less on , I went to the l i b r ar y to return a D V D .
Then , I went to the a g en c y to up g r ad e my dr ive r ' s l ic en se , but it turn ed out I was not able to up g r ad e it .
I need to sub m it a c er t if ic ation , but unti l I con ta c t the J a p an e se e m b as s y for it , I c a n ' t get a new l ic en se .
A fter that I went to a b an k to get some i nformation about how to open a b an k account .
On the way home , I d ropped by an a p p l i ance st or e in So u th g ate and b ough t a p or t able ra d i o .
J o h n , a kind c l er k , re c o m m en d ed a good one .
He show ed me one that works with so l ar p ow er and also has a d y n a m o c r an k .
O f course I got that one .
A fter that I went to a b ic y c le sh op and they only hand le sp e c i al ty pe s of b ic y c le s .
So I went there for nothing .
F in ish ing the present ation was a big l o ad off my mind .
No w I can get read y for my f in al ex a m in ation tomorrow .
A question
I was watch ing the big bang the or y and character s were us ing the p h r a se `` b ite me `` and I was wonder ing what that mean s ?
B y the way , this she l d on guy is very funny and the who le show is f ant a st ic .
The ro ad in front of my house has ch er ry tree s along the street .
On ly one tree b l o s s o m is v is i ble .
I ho pe another ch er ry b l o s s o m will show e ar ly . We would be ha p p y .
I look for w ar d to it .
What would be a good ch o ic e for me ?
so I have to become better at speak ing e ng l ish ,
so I de c id ed to go can ad a and already got a work ing ho l i day v is a .
after 5 month s I ' ll go there .
I have n ' t de c id ed anything .
the place I ' ll go , how to us e my work ing ho l i day v is a well . . .
I got a work ing ho l i day v is a so that I could le ar n English at a language school .
A fter that , I thought I ' d get a M ar ke ting or B us i ness c er t if ic ation , and us e it to get an in ter n s h i p .
are too high .
I need money to live .
So far , there ' s nothing that can get me a good in ter n s h i p .
What can I do with bad English ?
I would have to work as a dis h w ash er or something like that , go s h !
I do n ' t want to make the wrong ch o ic e .
I think it is my last ch ance in my life for my dr e a m to come tru e .
I had re ally good time on N e w Y e ar ' s E ve and N e w Y e ar ' s D a y .
However , I have to start my act i v it ies tomorrow .
I have a l ot of job in ter v i e w s this month .
It ' ll be t ough , but I ' ll enjoy it .
How to be us ed to do ing ro ut in e work .
I may be la z y , because I have never p l an n ed my s ch ed ul e .
I ' ve always thought that ma k ing a s ch ed ul e was b or ing .
But the sit u ation has change d , re c ent ly I ' m think ing about my future .
I went to a so c c er game to day .
We play ed at a school .
The re s ul t was three to two .
The next game ' s op p on ent was S en ri H i g i ri .
The re s ul t was six to z er o .
F ir st , last We d ne s day I took an ex a m at the un ive r s ity .
A ll day it was ra in ing .
A t l un ch , a light ra in in d u c ed me to bu y a de l ic i ous dis h ( e m p an ad as ) .
I finish ed the ex a m re ally f a st and then I went home to sleep .
I ch o se some sub j e c t s that will all ow me to keep work ing while study ing .
My care er , e ng in e er ing , re ally take s time to be comp le ted , and it is re ally easy to los e year s if you do not pass one sub j e c t in time .
I started to study this week , I feel con f id ent I will have a n ic e se m est er .

I am not good at it so I become tri ed quick ly .
This morning I did n ' t have class es so as usual I stay ed in the s el f - study room and did some study ing .
It is very interest ing and I have almost finish ed it so I am e age r to do it as soon as possible .
I usual ly run ten la p s ; each la p is four hu n d r ed me ter s long .

E s pe c i ally for me , if you do n ' t say anything
So , please , just as k any way .
The co a ch ' s a d v ic e were to watch a b a ll care ful ly and hi t the b a ll on c ent er of ra c ke t .

He also a d v is ed me that it was good to p r a c t ic e to s s ing the b a ll on the ra c ke t .
He be l on g ed to a t able ten n is c l u b and he went there two time s a week .
He said that ten n is and t able ten n is are the same .
He re c o m m en d ed me to start with t able ten n is .
You know , it is very difficult for J a p an e se to pro no un ce `` R `` and `` L `` c or re c t ly .
I know how to pro no un ce R and L
But , when it come s to `` p l ate `` , I pro no un ce it `` p r ate `` .
But , when I pro no un ce it very quick ly , I pro no un ce it `` p r ate `` .
To day I have to give a present ation to in c o m ing fresh m en on my gradua te school ex pe ri ence .
I am not n er v ous but I want to finish e ar ly because I have l ot s of work after w ar d s .
R e g ar d less I want to do my be st .
A re the J a p an e se l i ar s ? ( in English )
F or ex amp le , saying `` S e e you soon `` de s p ite not see ing after w ar d s , saying `` You speak J a p an e se very well ! `` when he ar ing only a f e w w or d s . . .
F or we J a p an e se the se are the un in ten tion al express ion or just the normal speak ing that we want to co m m un ic ate with other person natural ly though it see m s to be a lie at the other point of view .
I laugh ed at the M E L O N P A N which has no M el on ( ~ _ ~ ; )
( In J a p an there ' s a b re ad called M E L O N P A N ( me l on - b re ad ) but there is no me l on in it )
E ver y on e , do you think J a p an e se is l i ar a ccord ing to the a b o ve case s ?
Why do I like sweet s so much ?
I at e ti r a m is u and a piece of c he e se c a ke to day ! !
I like sweet s better than di e ting .
Yes ter day night I at ten d ed a teacher - p ar ent con f er ence . A t the con f er ence most of the p ar ent s were talk ing about their
ch il d re n ' s a c ad e m ic perform ance . They think that if their ch il d re n have l ow gra d es , they will los e face .
They only care about t est s c or es , not the le ar n ing pro ce s s .
In my opinion , t est s c or es are just an in d ic ation of ch il d re n ' s previous le ar n ing .
P ar ent s should care more about the ch il d re n ' s le ar n ing pro ce s s and le ar n ing me th o d s and help them over c ome difficult ies in their le ar n ing .
What is a he al th y life ?
But now it has change d a l ot .
I almost do n ' t read b ook s any m or e , and c ance l meeting s with the ex c us e that I had too much work to do .
To day a friend here on la ng - 8 who come s from the U S A c or re c ted my ent ry , and he said that he was in a comp ut er la b , and would re p ly to me next time , may b e even next week .
To m or r ow is another day , I live to day , everything in my mind happen ed yesterday .
I can speak C ant on e se well .
To m or r ow I will go to A u c k l and Z o o . . . .
I le ar n ed about this we b s ite from a b ook , which tell s me how to im p ro ve my English us ing i P ad .
I ho pe I can keep writing my di ar y in English here .
The D o d g er s b a se b a ll tea m is coming to T a i w an .
I ' m so ex cited to see a b a se b a ll game in T a i w an ! !
The cause may be because of an im p ro ve ment in my writing s k i ll s , but I am still not per f e c t ly con v in c ed .
am I feel ing that speak ing is the w or st of my English s k i ll s at the moment , even though I us ed to feel that speak ing was the be st .
They sit around my t able and they become my con ver s ation al part n er s that day .
I think my c he er ful person al ity will cause a good re s ul t .
The other a d v ant age is the ex is t ence of the con ver s ation al part n er s in front of me .
And also , speak ing is a two - way and re al - time co m m un ic ation , so we can con f ir m the mean ing with each other .
In other w or d s , there is no im m ed i ate way to know how much people will understand what I w ro te .
In addition to the a d v ant age s and dis ad v ant age s between the ty pe s of co m m un ic ation , there is a limit ation to my English le ve l .
I re ally ha te it when some on e mi s un d er st and s me .
That ' s why I did n ' t like writing something s in English .

I ho pe this U R L will help those people who c a n ' t read J a p an e se .
I am afraid of the future !
We thought the se were f i ction but they may be re al ity in the future !
I s that good ?

S in ce I have become b or ed of A m er ic an f o o d , it was very good .
I ' ve never eat en such good V i e t n ame se f o o d .
I at e too much , so I could n ' t eat dinner .
We re ally enjoy ed l un ch and cha t ting .
S an D o told me if we l o ve to eat good or i ent al f o o d , we should go to a re st a ur ant where are l ot s of or i ent al people .
I l o ve A m er ic an s up er m ar ke t s because they ' re very big and there is so much stuff .
I b ough t some b an an as , one s up er big bo t t le of f r u it j u ic e , a pack of ch o c o l ate c ook ies , ten dis c o un ted D V D s ( each one was just 5 do ll ar s . ) and a bo t t le of per f um e .
I also would l o ve to go to W al - M ar t in F l or id a again and bu y some more D V D s .
My pai n ting teacher , S and D o is V i e t n ame se .
While tak ing his class , he told me how he m aster ed English .
He also watch ed a bu n ch of mo v ies in English .
W at ch ing mo v ies is one of the be st and most interest ing way s .
U n t il I come back here next time , I would re ally like to im p ro ve my comp re h en s ion s k i ll s more ; I would like to become able to co m m un ic ate with my A m er ic an friend s much more .

He ' s a n aught y bo y , is n ' t he ?
I name d him P i k a .
I name d him P i k a , not because he is like a ra b b it with short e ar s .
A c t u ally , it ' s because of p i k a k ut ar .
( D o es any body know what that is ? )
He has straight w h ite f ur and pretty eyes .
He is only three month s .
O h ! A you ng p up p y re ally has a l ot of c ur i o s ity about the big big world .
J ust like a part of my body .
I will also treat him tender ly and with care .
( but I ' ll still be a ng ry with him and b l ame him when he does anything serious . )
I ho pe you can sha re your ex pe ri ence s with me : )
My p ar ent s came to T an z an i a to me e t me for one month .
A t the first when I me t them at the a ir p or t , I thought that one month would be a very long time to tra ve l around .
To day is my first time here . I ' m very ha p p y that there will be some friend s to help me study English .
To day is the twenty - second .
In Tokyo of J a p an , there are `` s amp le tree s `` of ch er ry b l o s s o m s in the Ya s u k un i - j in j a .
Some on e declar ed ch er ry b l o s s o m s began b l o o m ing when they found some f l ow er s came out ( of the s amp le tree s ) .
There were ch er ry b l o s s o m s that b l o ome d yesterday .
But they consider ed it less than enough for declar ing .
There are some ch er ry b l o s s o m tree s in my ne i g h b or h o o d .
There are many f a m ous l o c ation s to see ch er ry b l o s s o m s .

She does n ' t ever s k i p b re a k f a st in the morning for my family .

No w I can understand how hard she work ed for my family .
A n y way !
I feel ha p p y when ever think ing of the up c o m ing L un ar N e w Y e ar ' s D a y with my family .
A fter the N e w Y e ar , I will start a di e t . . . . . . . .
C an I ?
R e c ent ly , I have been study ing for 3 or 4 hour s a day , but R e ad ing and L is ten ing were ma in ly the large part .
S pe a k ing and writing were less , particular ly , just before To e ic .
To be honest , study ing to get a high s c or e was not an interest ing moment for me .
I wish I could write a di ar y ent ry every day .
la ng - 8 . co m is a n ic e we b s ite to im p ro ve my English a b il it ies ! !
No w , I ' m on va c ation .
What I did - and it was re ally n ic e - was go to a r ock conc er t perform ed by l o c al b and .
H o pe every on e is having f un n s um m er !
I have a question .
I ' m le ar n ing English now , but my English is very poor .
How can I im p ro ve my English ? O h my go d !
W ri ting a di ar y in English every day is hard for me .
I c a n ' t ( man age to ) make enough time for it .
If we make a c re a se even once on the p at ter n , it w o n ' t go away .
The c re a se will never dis a p pe ar .
L a st week en d , it was a long day off because last F ri day was M e m or i al D a y for de v ot ed people in w ar , such as de ce as ed p at ri ot s , so l d i er s and office r s of ar m ed for ce s .
The n ation al ho l i day p l us the week en d , I had three days to do something .
On F ri day , it was a c le an ing day because my p ar ent s want ed the w o o d en floor to be c le an ed up .
So for a half day we c le an ed it up , my p ar ent s and I were ex ha ust ed .
I could n ' t do anything but re la x .
L a st S at ur day , I felt down and want ed to go out for a walk so I went to H a e un d a e be a ch alone .
As you know , some t i e m s people do n ' t want to be to g e ther , just be alone .
When I ar ri v ed there , there were so many people who enjoy ed with their family , l o ver s and friend s .
I walk ed by myself along the be a ch and sat down on the s and to do some think ing and watch ing the sea view .
And I j o in ed the p ri v ate con ver s ation c l u b for im p ro v ing English s k i ll s .
E ver y S at ur day it is he l d in S e o m y e on .
B e c a us e it can be im p ro ve my English speech s k i ll s and it make s people come to g e ther as well .
To b ri e f ly let you know this c l u b , for five hour s people talk about s ever al to p ic s and make small talk .
There are no re st ri ction s to j o in the c l u b , just en ro ll on the we b s ite and then you can at ten d it every S at ur day .
On ce j o in ing this c l u b , I do n ' t go back home after finish ing con ver s ing .
U s u ally people go out to dr in k so j u and be er light ly .
And do something else like play sp or t s , such as play ing po o l , b ow ling and s ing ing to k ar a o ke .
As usual , we went to play po o l after finish ing con ver s ation .
We agree d on pay ment for po o l .
but I h ook ed up with her friend .
I do n ' t know why I did that .
I will write a di ar y of da i ly even t s and thought s .
A t first , my writing is a w k w ar d but , I should make pro g re s s every day .
I have l o v ed read ing c ar t o on s since I was a ch il d , es pe c i ally J a p an e se c ar t o on s .
T h ough C h in e se c ar t o on s have im p ro v ed a l ot , I still l o ve the style of J a p an e se c ar t o on s .
The c ar t o on called `` R ur o un i K en s h in `` is an e ar ly and sp e c i al me m or y of mi ne .
I do n ' t know how to express my feel ing about this comp le x is s u e .
The c ar t o on called `` R ur o un i K en s h in M e m or ies `` is very good , it ' s w or th watch ing .
I answered ' Yes , I understand .
I s this c or re c t ?
or should I have answered ' Yes , I do .
when should I answer ' Yes , I do .
I was so ha p p y , but I need ed to c ook by myself . I tri ed to do my be st , so I b ough t many d um p ling s , because they are easy to c ook . I at e them for two days . I play ed b as ke t b a ll with my friend in the after no on for four hour s . I had a good week en d .

I think it ' s more im p or t ant , though , to re al i z e that we ten d to worry too much about the ri s k s next to us , and ten d to i g no re those that see m to be far away .
F or ex amp le , S w in e f l u has k il led over / around 1 7 0 0 0 people in the U .
And it will con t in u e to k i ll this many people , more or less , every year .
C an we be ma k ing too much of this is s u e right now ?

A no ther ex amp le - c ar a c c id ent s k i ll about 4 0 0 0 0 people every year , but w h o give s up dr i v ing ?
Yes , we can con t ro l ri s k and our mind s .
However , once we tra p f e ar s of small l o c al at ta c k s in our mind s , `` ter r or `` can easily over - con t ro l our mind s .
That make s us d um b and we c a n ' t c or re c t ly an s w er the se kind s of question s - `` W h i ch is more serious ? `` and `` W h i ch can k i ll more ? ``
However , if we have the ri g h t i nformation , it will help us to over ta ke the effect s of f e ar .
The f in an c i al c ri s is make s it e as y for ust o los e our te m p er , so that ' s the reason I want ed to sha re this with you .

I had n ' t understood how to study English .
It w ro te about the reason s J a p an e se are we a k with English and the me th o d J a p an e se us e to study it e f f ic i en c y .
My opinion about study ing English was not comp le te ly wrong : p
It is whether I ' ve tri ed it or not .
I look for w ar d to b r ing ing about great change s in my bra in on this study ing a b ro ad .
To day is a tra d i tion al f est i v al in C h in a . I want go home e ar ly , but I have a s al on class at 6 o ' clock . I ' m so s ad !

If you are interest ed in my pro f i le , please con ta c t me on here or on S k y pe ( I D : c ry st al d e w 5 3 0 ) .
I think us ing for e i g n language s make s me dis c o ver new things about myself .
A c t u ally , this is my pro f i le for my to p p age .
I ' m afraid this es s a y may sound strange .
If it ' s al ri g h t with you , would you c or re c t the se sen t ence s ?

I ' m sorry if I made you los e your a p pe t ite .
I just want ed to us e some express ion s I le ar n ed yesterday because of my sit u ation .
The di f f er ence of the s m o k ing ra te s between ma le s and f e m al es in J a p an is much wide r than that in other co un t ri es s ur ve y ed .
It see m s to me , there f or e , the di f f er ence of the ra te s will dis a p pe ar if more and more w ome n begin to work outside the home .

I would like to watch it .
My p c has last ed almost a month since I got it back ( a month a g o it was de ad , T _ T ) . E ver y m or n ing when I get up , the first thing I do is to turn the p c on and think what I am going to do .
when all of the se are done , I ' m con f us ed again and have to t ally no idea what I am going to do .

I do n ' t even know why I am stay ing here .
My friend s told me , `` You must come back . D o n ' t be like this . You are going to gradua te soon . You must w a ke up , p re p ar e for it . `` But I just c a n ' t .
what can I do ?
It was f un and it was good ex pe ri ence .

I like s n ow y days very much .
I like to see the s n ow f l ow er s da n c ing in the a ir and s l ow ing down to the gr ound .
I str e t ch ed my p al m to wait for the s n ow da n c ing to it and put it in my mouth ; of course I would put it in to g e ther with a p r un e , ta st ing the favor s of s al t , so ur and sweet .
And then you could see w h ite s n ow every where , c le an and b ri g h t .
I still could re m e m b er the first time I enjoy ed the s n ow .
When my class m ate s and I de c id ed to s a c ri f ic e our sleep ing all night to c l im b to the to p of S e ve n - S t ar M o un tain , we put on all the he a v y c l o th ing we had .
When we went out to our a p ar t ment , there were c r ow d s p ar ad ing on the ro ad .
We j o in ed to the c r ow d s and laugh ted our s el ve s c r a z y .
It was a re ally n ic e time and we enjoy ed it very much .
I got a little sat is f i ed w i th speak ing English .
Yes ter day our business part n er came to J a p an .
S ur e ly we were able to c on ver se in English .
S in ce now a day s I study writing English on this p age and I can speak better than before .
I suppose that writing English is am o st the same as speak ing .
I got a little sat is f i ed w i th that .
I ' m study ing English v i a we b less on with the P h i ll i p p in o teacher .
They are very kind .

I have done s el f - study unti l now .
M o st ly , I st ud i ed in the train when I co m m ut ed to my office .
But I re al is ed that it will be difficult to m aster con ver s ation and writing that way .
R e c ent ly , the M T R had a short f il m comp e t i tion .
U s ing `` 1 0 3 `` as a to p ic for the f il m s .
No matter what , whether y o u are you ng or old ,
T ry ing to do something that is sp e c i al to make your life ha p p i er is the most im p or t ant thing .
just a way to explain / express that w e are the be st of our own .
A B us y L if e !
I feel that many things must finish ; for ex amp le : my home w or k , my pro g r a m , and so on .
We have some course left but I do n ' t want to go to class because other things see m more im p or t ant and my course is not interest ing .
A l th ough I always go to class , I read my b ook and do n ' t listen to what my teacher ' s saying .
R e c ent ly , some class m ate s had co l d s so they did n ' t go to class .
I us ed to run , but I have not had enough time to do it l ate ly .
F or t un ate ly , I have a good body so I can do many things ; however , I feel too tired at the moment .
It ' s a bu s y life but it is ha p p y !
I dr in k a l ot of water and bu y 1 . 5 l it er bo t t led V o l v ic every day on my way to the office .
They ' ve been so good to me even though they ' ve had some t ough time s re c ent ly .
I c ri ed when I hu g g ed his mother good b y e .
It was very de l ic i ous .
I am writing to as k you about the p l an to bu il d a sh op p ing c ent er near the p ar k .
I found out about the p l an to day by read ing a new s p a p er ar t ic le about an in ter v i e w in which you were explain ing the p l an .
I am also w or ri ed about what the effect s on the en v ir on ment of this are a will be , such as tra f f ic and no is e po ll u tion .
I would like to know the de ta il s of the p l an .
U n less you do so and I agree the idea , I will not we l c ome the sh op p ing c ent er .
I would be very gr ate ful if you re p l i ed me with in ten days .
The c l im ate in j a p an is usual ly very hu m id , but in this sea s on , it ' s even w or se !
I w an n a go some where where the we a ther is clear er .
I started writing a di ar y o n la ng - 8 , but the number of c or re c ted time s is only one . . .
I s there any trick to get ting c or re c ted by some on e well ?
It would have been better if I had got ten a a p re m i um me m b er s h i p . . .
My un c le is 39 year s old .
I thought that that could happen only to other people ( ? ? )
And we went to the w ed d ing place .
The w ed d ing started at 1 1 .
A fter the w ed d ing we took picture s .
N e x t , the tra d i tion al K or e an w ed d ing started .
He ll o , every body ! !
I took part in a perform ance which was made to we l c ome the fresh m en .
The perform ance I dance d in was about the `` 5 . 1 2 `` v i o l ent e ar th qu a ke . It was about a teacher who s a v ed her st ud ent at the last second , and the girl found the teacher in He a ve n where they dance d to g e ther , push ing the perform ance to it s c l im a x .
The play is a t est im on i al to the strong affect ion between the teacher and the little girl .
This picture is from the last scene .
I l o v ed the dance !
It was my honor to part ic i p ate in the perform ance , and I made friend s with all of h te act or s includ ing the little girl , the teacher , and the other a ng el s .
He is a f a m ous J a p an e se b a se b a ll play er and is c ur r ent ly a me m b er of the S e at t le M ar in er s .
When it come s to past a d m ir able f a m ous people , I think of M o ther T er es a .
She de d ic at ed her s el f to help ing people who were poor or sick .
He r who le life can de f in ite ly tea ch them the sign if ic ance of help ing other people .
It is ne ce s s ar y for me to re p ly to e m a il s in English .
But I know that my English is bad .
I ' m very str es s ed .
A t work on the middle of the ho l i day s .
I ' m at work now even though it ' s the middle of the ch us u k ho l i day s .
My high er office r have been w or ri ed about any da m age to the bu il d ing and his me n .
It ' s very quiet and pe a ce ful to day ex c ept for the c l o ud y s k y .
There see m s to be no da m age to our comp an y .
D es p ite the fact , I have to be here because I was told that .
I original ly p l an ed to visit my re l at ive s to day . They live in S e o ul , which is near my place .
I mi s s them . I wish I could have visit ed them to day .
The only thing I can do is call them and say he ll o .
W h o ever read this ent ry , might also be at work .
You however might sp en d your We d ne s day s off of work .
That would be the di f f er ence between you and ( ? ) me .
I turn ed the ra d i o on , and am listen ing to A F K N , a cha n n el for the U S ar m y in Y on g s an .
It ' s in in English , so I do n ' t understand much , but it ' s b ro ad c as ting a l ot of good p op s on g s .
I to t ally enjoy that !
H a ve a n ic e day !
R e c ent ly , I have done some less on s us ing a comp ut er .
I kept us ing the comp ut er for a while this morning .
So my eyes are very tired .
It ' s s un n y to day , I was h ed c l o th es . I hung out the c l o th es and a ma t t re s s .
To m or r ow , I will work because I have to finish a ta s k that I have n ' t finish ed yet .
To day , I have s up p le ment le c ture s .
N at ur ally to day is a ho l i day .
I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent .
I ' m in my j un i or year of co ll e g e .
I ' m bad at speak ing for e i g n language s , but I like tra ve ling a b ro ad and I ' m interest ed in in ter n ation al co m m un ic ation .
I stay ed in E ng l and for a month .
And I have visit ed H a w a i i and So u th K or e a .
I want to go on a tri p !
( I wish I could write a good s el f in t ro d u ction in English . )
I ' d like to try to d y e my ha ir from b r ow n to b ro n z e ( I was b or n with black ha ir ) , a p ar t from whether it s u it s me or not ^ ^
I wish b ro n z e ha ir would s u it me l o l
One is that d y ing ha ir da m age s my ha ir , another is that b ro n z e ha ir does n ' t s u it me .
A l th ough I like my natural ha ir co l or , black , I want to attempt to d y e my ha ir .
I did n ' t write any English w or d s for quite a long time since I left here .
But re c ent ly , I entered a law f ir m and started my care er as a law y er .
It is not easy for me to hand le the part n er ' s as s i g n ment well .
F or ex amp le , I dr a f t some le g al re se ar ch ti t led `` M in ing In ve st ment in the P h il i p p in es `` .
I am interest ed in B B C T V s er ies .
I s it a good idea to at ten d a sub t it ling gr o up ?
So D or a y a k i has R a b b it de s i g n s .
My el d est so n at e a l ot of D or a y a k i like D O R A E M O N .
And I also like de a th such ty pe s of m us ic as me t al , gr in d c or e and go re g r in d .
My da ir y was los t d u e to the serve r being down after I c l ic k ed the `` sub m it `` but t on .
I have no way but re - write it , and it is now 1 1 : 3 0 P M which is l ate for me . . .
I f in ally finish ed the pay ro ll c al c ul ation for A u g ust on time .
O h , I for g ot to in t ro d u ce that I work in the hu man re s o ur ce de p ar t ment , and have been since I gradua ted from co ll e g e .
C ur r ent ly there are more than 3 5 0 e m p l o y e es s ta f f ed in our f a c il ity , and for me , it take s at least 2 days to comp le te pay ro ll c al c ul ation p ri or to sub mission each month .
There is an on line H R s y s te m that was la un ch ed last year to f a c il it ate the pay ro ll pro ce s s , im p ro ve a c c ur a c y and s a ve time on ma s s da ta pro ce s s ing by up d at ing b as ic person n el i nformation , includ ing but not limit ed to s ta f f mo ve ment and salary a d j ust ment .
I am going to s a ve the a b o ve in M ic ro s o f t W or d before po st ing .
To day , I went to the l i b r ar y to study English .
On the way to it , high school students were play ing b a se b a ll in the st ad i um .
I watch ed it for a while because they seemed to enjoy it .
T h an k s mo m !
The ra d i ation le ve l in Tokyo is as usual a ccord ing to me as ur e ment on the 1 9 th .
But J a p an e se go ver n ment request ed not to go ( ? ) for w ar d .
I can only p r a y .
R o ll ing black o ut s for ce us to stop work .
To day , I me t the new s ta f f me m b er in our office .
He r face is so small !
It ' s about one - th ir d the s i z e of mi ne . . .
I had a l un ch with her and some other co ll e a gue s from our de p ar t ment to we l c ome her .
She has to get us ed to her new job as soon as possible ,
so I will have to help her .
To m or r ow , I will make a speech in morning meeting .
No w , I will go p re p ar e for it . . .
My G r and f a ther ' s H ous e
The day before yesterday , I went to my gr and f a ther ' s house to stay with my friend s .
My ( gr and ? ) father ' s home is in the sub ur b of Ka ng W on D o .
And some time s my ce ll p h on e does n ' t work because there are so many mo un tain s near b y .
A l th ough it is a little in c on ve n i ent , there is c le an a ir , water , and very beautiful scene ry .
We had a good time .
But the next day , we could n ' t go home , because there was too much ra in and the ro ad s to S e o ul were block ed .
F or t un ate ly , we could go home once the ra in stop p ed .
If the we a ther is good , I would like to go there again .
I re ally like the so ng `` S ing S ing `` the be st .
E m man u el le S e i g n er , a F re n ch act re s s , is the le ad v o c al is t of the b and .
The reason why I b ough t this C D was only her voice .
I saw a mo v i e ti t led `` The D i v ing B e ll and the But ter f ly `` last week . The mo v i e f e a ture s their so ng `` D o n ' t K is s M e G o o d b y e `` .
To day , the 1 46 th T O E I C took place and I took it .
I mar k ed all the answer s , but I do n ' t know what s c or e I will get .
F or p re p ar ation , I p r a c t ic ed the ex a m and read gra m m ar b ook s , in s te ad of writing j o ur n al s .
I ' m not sure if I can get ga in more a c c ur a c y for my gra m m ar and my v o c a b ul ar y through the ex er c is e .
But I clear ly understand that I need to im p ro ve my read ing sp e ed of English .
When I asked my English teacher question s about the t est , he answered so f a st , so quick ly .
It was a b it strange for me , because the se b ook s were written in J a p an e se and they were read ing J a p an e se more than English .
So , how will they be s u ce s s ful if they read J a p an e se ?
But new s p a p er s in English have a much ri ch er so ur ce of v o c a b ul ar y .
There f or e , the T O E I C is just a turn ing point .
I want to im p ro ve this s k i ll as much as I can !
I ' m tired now , so I ' ll commen t on my past j o ur n al s .
T h an k you for c or re c ting my j o ur n al s .
There are a l ot of ch er ry b l o s s o m s
which s y m b o l i z e sp r ing time in J a p an .
and I ho pe I ' ll be able to write better English .
I ho pe to tea ch J a p an e se too .
C h at ting is difficult for people more than what they think .
A b ook in which ti p s about cha t ting is written is very much so l d in J a p an .
I ra re ly go to V an c o u ver because it take s 4 hour s from my town .
So I ' m always bu s y sh op p ing when I stay there .
I de f in ite ly get a l ot of J a p an e se b ook s at `` B ook O f f `` .
I usual ly bu y no ve l s and I like all kind s of them F or ex amp le , I like my s ter y , a d ve n ture , S .
S e ar ch ing for b ook s is re ally ex c it ing . x D
I always enjoy look ing for them .
I am living in Tokyo , J a p an .
But I do n ' t watch J a p an e se dr a m as or an im e .
S im il ar ly , I am not f a m il i ar with J R ock .
T al k ing about m us ic , I ' m more f a m il i ar with E ur o pe an and A m er ic an m us ic .
B e c a us e my di ar y got a l ot of commen t s !
It is difficult to study English comp o s i tion myself / alone .
So L an g - 8 is great ! ! ! ! O r `` us e ful ``
I will do my be st to study English ! !
I write this di ar y in English for the first time .
I have been study ing English since the e le ment ar y school .
However , it is I was not good at it .
I think that I work ed re ally hard .
I went to the ha ir s al on for a ha ir c ut yesterday .
I had 3 p h ot o s of R ing o S in a , and so I made a request to the be a ut y ar t is t .
`` C an you c ut my ha ir to look like her ? `` .
He looked at her p h ot o s many time s , and then he was c ut ting my ha ir .
H is s al on is small , but he has a good te ch n i qu e .
And when my ha ir c ut was finish ed , I looked at my ha ir in the mi r r or .
My heart and my ha ir felt light er .
A bout 9 0 people were k il led .
Why did he at ta c k in no c ent people ?
I do n ' t know what he was think ing .
C an people own a g un in No r way ?
If there were no g un s , there would n ' t be any ter ro ri st at ta c k s .
I think g un s are un ne ce s s ar y .
In J a p an , o b es ity is a big is s u e for a d ul t s .
O f course , It ' s a big is s u e for me .
U s u ally I go to the g y m to keep in good sha pe ,
but my we i g h t still stay s the same .
My friend told me to run , do sit - up s and a b d o m in al ex er c is es
So I just now started do ing them .
I ' ve been ex er c is ing that way for three days .
B y next s um m er , I ' d like to show off my f ir m m us c le s .
I tri ed to cha ll e ng e many time s .
My job is to ma k game s and we b sit e .
There f or e , I like J a p an e se - man g a and v id e o game s .
I like to listen to m us ic and go for a walk too .
I will play a v id e o game with x b o x to day .
And , I am think ing to go for a walk .
I want to write every day , but some time s I do n ' t know what to write . O ther time s , when I start to write , I do n ' t know how to say something and I do n ' t finish it .
I think I need to study more and le ar n more v o c a b ul ar y .
I usual ly watch f il m s and s er ies in English with sub t it le s .
No w I am watch ing L o st , and I think I could understand most of it without sub s .
I am tired , so I am going to have dinner and watch one L o st e p is o d e before I go to be d .
I have one question though , what is it the di f f er ence between a `` town `` and a `` c ity `` ?
I have been a little bu s y and I have not written no r c or re c ted much l ate ly .
I ' ve just started us ing L an g - 8 . I want to study English and F re n ch .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to ex pe ri en c ing L an g - 8 !
S e e You N e x t Y e ar !
My F l or id i an friend return ed to his country .
I re ally re ally mi s s him .
When I looked at the things that he had us ed in my house , I re m e m b er ed him .
There are too many me m or ies in my house .
When I saw his gr e en s and al s that he left in my house , I c ri ed and thought about him .
It ' s hard on me also .
T h an k s Z a c for the 2 month s we had to g e ther .
I would l o ve to tell him : T h an k you so much from the bo t t o m of my heart .
I like sh ar ing my life with them .
No w they cha t with me on line on QQ .
I ho pe I make more friend s on L an g - 8 .
Some person s have go ne to other se ction and some on e has come to my for m er se ction .
I am the one of the person s who has go ne .
However people who are still in the se ction are talk ing about me and sen d me e - ma il s .
I than k my for m er co ll e a gue s .
I was and am s up p or ted by a l ot of people .
I want to make an an im ation us ing very f e w di al o gue s .
I want to make an an im ation us ing very f e w di al o gue s , because I want to make world - class pro d u ction s .
I know it ' s difficult to do , but I will keep try ing it .
I read an ar t ic le in a new s p a p er about the J a p an e se e c on o m y two days a g o .
As you already know , J a p an became the s up er a g ing so c i e ty , and old people who will re t i re a f e w year s la ter are very de s p er ate to pro te c t their position s in their own comp an ies .
F or old people , you ng job a p p l ic ant s and work er s are just n u is ance , because If you ng work er s ent er a comp an y , the comp an y may f i re old work er s who have been tak ing good pay for a long time .
O l d er work er s are afraid of it .
So some time s old work er s bu l ly you ng work er s unti l new work er s qu i .
O l d people always da re to give us us e less le c ture s , like `` C on te m p or ar y you ng people do n ' t make effort s at all `` and `` They want to get only high stand ar d job s , there are many job s they can do , even though pay ment s are not good , why are their idea l so high ? `` . M a y b e they have never read job a d ver t is e ment s at all .
They do n ' t have di c k s and b ow l s . > > b a ll s ?
T h an k you for your a d v ic e on my P C .
I have n ' t in ve st i g at ed it close ly yet .
It has end ed up on the back - b ur n er .
It might be the same as when some people po st po ne going to the ho s p it al when they do n ' t feel well because of bu s y ness .
In my previous ent ry , I asked about [ the di f f er ence between ] `` to per s u ad e `` and `` to con v in ce . ``
T h an k s to all of your explanation s , I understood the di f f er ence well .
So we need to w in our bo s s over another way .
I will take an English less on at T ur ry ' s co f f e e sh op to day .
It is the second time .
I do n ' t us e any te x t b ook or di ction ar y .
We talk about any th to p ic s .
I found the teacher on a we b s ite called `` my sen se i .
My teacher is a 2 8 year old woman .
She is n ic e to me .
But , it co st s 4 8 0 0 per hour .
W ow , I have to draw money from b an k ! ! ! !
I got ta go !
E g o and O ther P e op le
I said to him , `` C an I help you ? `` or `` What are you look ing for ? ``
A t the we l c ome part y , he told me that he was surprise d that I ga ve him a hand .
I am not sure that I comp le te ly understood what he told me , but I would like to s um m ar i z e what he said .
They va l u e a ut on o m y .
They do not give a hand to another person without being asked .
They think that he does not need help if he does n ' t say anything .
The se are co m m on way s of think ing in J a p an .
I tri ed to help him in the J a p an e se way .
This was c ul ture sh ock for me .
It has been a while already since I became un c er tain of or ch est r a con d u c ting , but to day I le ar n ed something .
M a y b e it will be a b re a k th r ough .
A ta ng led th re ad in my head may be un r a ve led .
I found myself feel ing ex cited in the train back to Tokyo .
W he ther I can get hold of it or not depend s on how I sp en d every day .
When I w o ke up , I felt ex t re m e ly good .
I think it ' s because I went to be d e ar ly .
We went there to help my p ar ent s ' work .
T h ough it was a little b it hard work , we enjoy ed help ing them out .
I gue s s I can sleep ti g h t to night and feel much better tomorrow .
Yes ter day , I don at ed my b l o o d , ho p ing it could s a ve some on e ' s life , for the first time in the year 2 0 1 1 .
The J a p an e se C on st it u tion all ow s any on e who se age is over 1 6 to don ate 2 0 0 c c of b l o o d .
I will give her a surprise at C h ri st m as .
L a st night our teacher talk ed about the D re a m of Red M an s ion with us .
This no ve l was one of the most f a m ous no ve l s written by C a o X u e Q in who live d in Q in D y n as ty .
This no ve l now has s ever al ver s ion s .
However , I think that the first ver s ion is the most p op ul ar .
R e c ent ly , another direct or made another ver s ion .
This one is like a night m ar e .
The make up and m us ic was very ho r ri ble like a g h o st f il m .
The act or s and act re s se s are very you ng so they do n ' t know how to perform this t v show .
The di al o gue is almost re pe at ed ex a c t ly from the no ve l .
There are many voice over s through out the t v show .
I need to p re p ar e for an ex a m re la ted to my work which I ' m going to take next week .
I also want to make more time for le ar n ing English , but I c a n ' t man age to do both of them .
I wish I could be a little better at m ul t i - ta s k ing .
I gradua ted from dr i v ing school last week .
I want to get my l ic en se soon !
I ' m interest ed in j a p an e se and k or e an c ul ture .
I l o ve an im e and man g a .
I think J a p an should f o c us more on re l ation s with other n ation s for s ever al reason s .
S e c on d ly , among As i an n ation s , J a p an is the only a d v ance d n ation , so J a p an should show other n ation s how to de al with in ter n ation al re l ation s with E ur o pe an n ation s and the United States .
J a p an e se people are hard - work ing and our po l it ic i an s and di p l o m at s have had good re l ation s with the United S ta ted and E ur o pe an n ation s .
One was that J a p an should f o c us more on re l ation s with other As i an n ation s because J a p an should take a ro le as a le ad ing n ation among As i an co un t ri es .
The other reason was that J a p an know s a l ot about re l ation s with E ur o pe an n ation s and A m er ic a , so we should us e the a d v ant age to co m m un ic ate and have a good re l ation s h i p with other n ation s .
My desk in my office is usual ly much ne at er than most of my co ll e a gue s ' desk s .
However a l ot of ( hard c op y ) do c u ment s have been p il ing up on my desk and the draw er is / has become full of them re c ent ly .
I de c id ed to take some time to c he c k whether the do c u ment s were re ally ne ce s s ar y for me or not .
To my surprise , the re s ul t was that I could re d u ce the p i le to one f if th it s original am o un t .
If you have some trouble in your work [ at your job ] , I re c o m m en d that you c le an your desk .
I do not know how to me m or i z e English .
. F ir st ly , I want to le ar n b as ic con ver s ation al English .
How should I start study ing ?
I went to view ch er ry b l o s s o m s with my w if e last S un day .
We b ough t some co f f e e and c a ke .
We enjoy ed eat ing c a ke and dr in k ing co f f e e under the C h er ry B l o s s o m s be s id e the ri ver side .
E ver y on e enjoy ed c ook ing B B Q and play ing light sp or t s .
I had a re la x ing time .
came to the bra n ch
To day it is a ho l i day and the we a ther ' s n ic e .
If I had p l an s , I think I would go to some where , but . . . . . ! !
I did n ' t have p l an s to day . so , I w o ke up at 1 1 : 0 0 . then I at e l un ch , watch ed a D V D and play ed u ku le le .
If it ' s a n ic e day tomorrow , I will go ( out ) some where !
What a both er !
That re m a in s me , I have to finish my home w or k by the day after tomorrow .
C o ul d you please tea ch me the reason in de ta il .
I found that I ' ve been writing my j o ur n al in English for around 7 0 days .
I want to express my idea s or my feel ing s in English more and more .
B e f or e writing a j o ur n al , I did n ' t pay at ten tion to no un s .
T h ough there are two kind s of no un s ( one is a co un t able no un , the other is an un c o un t able no un ) in English , we do n ' t have such idea s in J a p an e se .
I es pe c i ally do n ' t understand a b st r a c t no un s .
On the other hand , I ten d to think how I express J a p an e se p h r as es in English every day .
F or ex amp le , while I talk with my friend , I think of how I can express this feel ing in English .
Then , when I talk with my English teacher , I of ten re p l i ed with two or three w or d s before , but I ten d to be able to re p ly with comp le te sen t ence s which I made , even though my comp le te s ent ence s are wrong in most case s .
However , if I keep p r a c t ic ing the se things , I will be able to m aster English some day .
There f or e , I think keep ing a di ar y is one of the be st way s indeed .
I have been j o g g ing for an hour almost every night for three month s .
T h ough M c D o u g a ll re c o m m en d ed run n ing us ing l ow - c us h ion sh o es in this b ook , I think there is a ri s k for begin n er s to hu r t their f o ot .
A c t u ally , I hu r t my feet us ing V i b r a m F ive F ing er s sh o es .
So , al th ough I do n ' t know if I can run the who le dis t ance , I de c id ed to try a full mar a th on in A p ri l and an ul t r a m ar a th on in J un e .
The tree - p l ant ing ce re m on y was he l d near where I live .
It was a very big ce re m on y there ,
because the E m p er or and E m p re s s came to p l ant tree s by themselves .
There are many ro ad s that had been re p a ir ed , re - p a v ed or new ly made around and to w ar d s the p ar k where the ce re m on y was he l d , to p re p ar e for the ce re m on y .
The E m p er or and E m p re s s p l ant ed see d s and va ri ous kind s of tree s a p ling s , includ ing po ll en - less c ed ar s .
It was p ity that it ra in ed all the time d ur ing the ce re m on y , but many other at t r a ction s were there , like some dance s , read ing some es s a y s , e t c .
We wish the tree s will gr ow up he al th i ly , and that we will keep the mo un tain s and nature beautiful .
This is my first di ar y .
I got to g e ther with my friend s to have an O K O N O M I Y A K I part y to day .
O k on o m i y a k i , which look s like a p an c a ke , is a kind of l o c al f o o d in J a p an .
We enjoy ed eat ing them and talk ing .
In addition , we watch ed J U D O in the o ly m p ic s .
It was p ity that the J a p an e se play er could n ' t w in a first p ri z e .
E a ch country ' s n ation al de b t b re ed s dis t r ust of the world e c on o m y after the c ri s is in G re e ce .
A fter L e h man ' s f a ll , the g l o b al de p re s s ion has ne ce s s it at ed f is c al a ction , so it see m s natural that the de b t s are gr ow ing large .
In addition , J a p an keep s c ur r ent - account s ur p l us , so J a p an might be consider ed to be re l at ive ly st able .
With o ut good pro s pe c t for ra p id im p ro ve ment of each country ' s c ur r ent account , the c ri s is / th re at ? of de f a ul t see m s to get more serious , and I think the c r u c i al per i o d is yet to come .
I l o g g ed into this sit e L an g - 8 for the first time .
B e c a us e my English t ut or ga ve me this U R L .
I will try to write my di ar y in English start ing from to day . . . !
`` You will go to a far place You do n ' t know where it is no r how far .
You can take five an im al s there .
But you c a n ' t take all the an im al s all the way .
You have to leave an an im al on the way .
When you go a short dis t ance , you ' ll have to leave an an im al again .
W h i ch an im al will you leave 1 st ?
What about the 2 n d , 3 r d , 4 th ?
What about the last one ?
H a ve you de c id ed ?
The `` far place `` is your life ' s j o ur ne y .
E a ch an im al has a mean ing as follow s .
W h i ch an im al did you leave 1 st ?
W h i ch an im al was last ?
P le a se think about your de c is ion s and your reason s .
# This is the t est I heard to day .
I ho pe you can get understand , even though my English is poor . . .
I have come here re c ent ly and con se qu ent ly do not know many English w or d s .
The d ent is t at ta ch ed me t al f it ting s to my te e th .
He said my te e th will a ch e a f e w hour s la ter , and I c a n ' t eat b re a k f a st the next morning because of the pai n .
What is a s ad d est thing for me is that I will not be able to eat ri ce c a ke s .
I had stand it for two year s already !
I ' m sleep y this morning .
It ' s ra in ing . The we a ther re p or t s are call ing for a `` G u er ri ll a down po ur `` .
We had a dinner after that .
I enjoy ed it but my body hu r t s now .
I was sh ock ed by how many things I have to know .
I have ( get ) the feel ing ( that ) I ' ll either pass or f a i this ex a m by a very s l im mar g in .
If I can find time to comp la in about how difficult this is , sure ly I can find the time to study just one more p age .
It ' s such a bu s y day .
I ra re ly have time to write anything .
R es pe c t for sen i or c it i z en s day
To day is a n ation al ho l i day , `` respect for sen i or c it i z en s `` day .
B e f or e le g al change s , this day was on the 1 5 th of S ept e m b er .
No w , we have a three - day week en d .
We call this day `` H a p p y M on day `` .
My s um m er va c ation has finish ed . . . .
no wait , my s um m er va c ation finish es to day .
now s um m er is go ne , the next sea s on is f a ll .
What do you think of when you he ar the sea s on of f a ll ?
I re c a ll good f o o d and b ook s ^ ^ *
I l o ve eat ing de l ic i ous f o o d and read ing interest ing b ook s !
I think about sp or t . . . .
I dis like sp or t s , because I am not very good at them .
It is good ta s te . It ta s te good .
But , I am feel ing just a little . sleep y
The se days , I of ten read sp or t s new s on the in ter ne t .
The new s p a p er is called da i ly m a il .
There are f e w J a p an e se so c c er play er s on the E ng l and so c c er tea m .
I sp ent the day study ing English so I need ed to mo ve my body .
H aving finish ed read ing al o ud while train ing , I took a walk .
The go al for W al k ing in J a p an is 9 2 0 0 s te p s for me n and 8 3 0 0 s te p s for w ome n .
I do n ' t know how many s te p s I took to day
but my gr and m o ther take s about 2 0 0 0 s te p s in 2 0 minute walk s
I think I took not less than 6 0 0 0 s te p s .
A d d ing 3 2 0 0 s te p s can make me re a ch that go al .
I ' ll do s ome walk ing every day from to day on
He re , is to day ' s di ar y .
The p l ate is to p re v ent over he at ing d ur ing the s um m er .
I am re ally gr ate ful to them .
I was p l an n ing to study English after work , but a friend asked me for my help , which took an hour .
A fter that , I just talk ed with some friend s , another was te of time , o op s !
I le ar n ed the express ion , `` in va in `` from the ra d i o . l o l , h m m , I not ic ed ( or / see ) many people like us ing it .
I told a friend to come here to le ar n English . She is hung ar i an . I me t her last year at re d un ive r se ( f f 0 0 0 0 . co m ) , which is a f l ash we b s ite where people can talk ( to each o ther ) .
It is a very funny place , and I have me t many friend s there , wish you guy s would like it .
But I los t my job . I had work ed as an as s is t ant to a came r a man . The bo s s had p l an n ed to r ent a b a se ment of about 1 0 0 0 square me ter s .
When he was about to pay for the r ent , the l and l or d took it back .
So , I became the ex ce s s person , and left .
I went back sha ng ha i .
I have a s te ad y job at present .
The day has just go ne like water .
A friend told me she want s to go a b ro ad to study .
She does n ' t like an un ch an g ing every day ex is t ence .
I want to do that too , al ri g h t now I have two p l an s .
I down l o ad ed some w h ite b ri ch so ng s .
I l o ve this kind of we a ther
The se days the we a ther has become co o l er than before .
The reason is because it ' s co l d in the No r th ( so we , people who live in the So u th , can feel the co l d from there - I do n ' t know how to write this sen t ence ) and it ' s also the end of No ve m b er , so it ' s near ly C h ri st m as .
If I did n ' t have to go to work I ' m sure I would be sit ting in a co f f e e sh op , dr in k ing my f a v o ur ite co f f e e and cha t ting with my friend s now .
I want to go back to the time s when I was still a st ud ent and I could stay in be d long er when it was co l d or could go out with my friend s on a beautiful day like this .
I mi s s those days .
B e c a us e it ' s co l d I have to we ar a th in co at when I go out ( I usual ly just we ar it when it ' s hot ) , a h I should bu y a new co at .
T im e to re la x ! = ) I just ar ri v ed home . . .
I must do my English home w or k , because I will go to my English teacher on F ri day . I am going to go for a walk with my friend s now . E ver y body good night !
He ll o !
I ' m study ing for an entrance ex a m that ' s on next F ri day .
A fter I ent er co ll e g e , I want to study English more .
P le a se c or re c t my writing .
P ar ent s should n ' t show their bad ha b it s or be ha v i or s in front of their ch il d re n .
This is because ch il d re n ten d to quick ly im it ate what o c c ur s in front of them .
If a p ar ent l it ter ed , their ch il d would simpl y think that it is n ' t wrong , and he or she would ra p id ly im it ate this bad be ha v i or .
This is bad .
F ur ther m or e , once ch il d re n f a ll into a bad ha b it , it is difficult for them to change .
To day I went to dr i v ing school , because . . . .

To day I did the p r a c t ical s k i ll t est and pass ed .
I want a dr i v ing l ic ence as soon as possible .
To day I change d display to show p h ot o s of my girl friend ' s and my mo m saw it .
She was just surprise d because my girl friend is p re t t i er than she expect ed .
Well indeed I thought I ' m just as good - look ing as she is . . . , just de c id ed to let it go .
B y the way , start ing yesterday , I ' m do ing what I can for her here .
My idea s are to write a di ar y here and to sen d voice ma il to her by e m a il .
In fact , I ' m not sure how long I can con t in u e this since I ' m very la z y person and easily get tired but I ' ll try .
I b ough t a s k ir t , a T - shirt , and a k n it .
I want ed to bu y a back p a c and sh o es .
But I could n ' t find one which I l o v ed .
To day was so n ic e day !
A n 8 . 9 ma g n it ud e e ar th qu a ke hi t J a p an follow ed by a t s un a m i .
I just saw a l ot of F a ce b ook friend s who keep sh ar ing the v id e o of that J a p an t s un a m i .

C a u tion for ne i g h b o ur ing co un t ri es .

I went to my home town
But my friend from A i ch i came to F u ku o k a .
I g u id ed them around F u ku o k a and now have sen t them home .

P e op le will w or s h i p g h o st s . ( R e ally ? )
But the l un ar c al en d ar in J u ly is im p or t ant to B ud d h is m .
I ' m both ha p p y and w or ri ed .
I ' m ha p p y because I ( ? ) have a l ot of f o o d .
I am w or ri ed . . .
because I am afraid of g h o st s .
H i , I went sh op p ing at S h i b u y a .

In M a y , I will go to C h in a for school tra ve l .

I will do my be st !
H i , it ' s very n ic e here to day .
I took a walk with my do g around the are a .
This is picture of us walk ing to g e ther .
He is a tra d i tion al J a p an e se do g , a S h i b a - in u .
S h i b a is the most p op ul ar b re ed of do g in J a p an , and I he ar it ' s get ting p op ul ar in the U S and in other co un t ri es as well .
But the most co m m on co l or for S h i b a is b r ow n , so my do g ' s co l or c a n ' t be see n clear ly . . .
I ' ll talk about him in de ta il next time .
P re p ar ing to study a b ro ad
A big change in my life is coming soon .
To m or r ow , I will go C an ad a to study for 8 month s .
I must se le c t what I leave at home .
If possible , please give me any a d v ic e because I c a n ' t de c id e how to se le c t d u e to in s u f f ic i ent in f o ( r m ation ) .
I `` m be at , because I have been c aught up in some pro ble m s at work re c ent ly .
On days like this , I should read some funny co m ic s or something before going to be d , and think about those pro ble m s tomorrow .
I ' ll probab ly be able to work it all out some h ow .
The ch l or op h y ll of my heart . . .
It mean s that is a p re c i ous person for me .
In case of p l ant s , the ch l or op h y ll is very im p or t ant for the p l ant s ' gr ow th .
In a n ut s he ll , the ch l or op h y ll is a b s o l ut e ly need ed by p l ant s .
I want to find a woman who is like the ch l or op h y ll .
She will make me so ha p p y , and I will also make her ha p p y .
W h o ever that person may b e , to have the ex is t ence such like the ch l or op h y ll . . .
O f course , I do not know that person yet .
A n y way I ' m going to be d ! ! !
My name is L o v .
I still c a n ' t write English very well , so if you have some free time , please tea ch me my mistake s in my di ar y .
' In un d ate ' is to be at ta c k ed by water ( or f l o o d ed ) .
J ust ten year s a g o in 1 99 8 , we were am id st the year s called la ter `` L o st T en Y e ar s `` .
In the s um m er of the year , p ri m e mi n is ter K e i z o O b u ch i , who had just been in a u g ur at ed , perform ed in front of a f r u it and ve g e t able st or e .
I think many re m e m b er that .
The cha in re a ction of f al ling st ock p ri ce s ra v age d the world mar ke t again , even though we thought it was over .
The p ri ce s in the Tokyo mar ke t ex pe ri ence d the second high est ra te of de c line in the w a ke of the p l un g e in N e w Y or k ( st ock mar ke t ) .
A ccord ing to est im ate s of a p ri v ate re se ar ch in st it ut e , the va l u e of in d i v id u al sha re s and in ve st ment tru st f un d s had go ne down by about 1 0 0 tri ll ion yen between the end of J un e last year and the end of S ept e m b er this year .
This is un f or g i v able to the people who have in ve st ed their s aving s for their po st - re t i re ment year s .
A ccord ing to st ock tra d er s , the p l un g e in N e w Y or k mar ke t last week is because of the an x i e ty about the U . S .
f in an c i al s y s te m , but the one this week is because of the clear er ten d en c y of the re ce s s ion .
If the act u al e c on o m y in the U S
is re ally a g g r a v at ed , it is very di re for J a p an , which depend s ma in ly on ex p or t s .
T h ough there was a b ri e f re c o ver y from `` L o st T en Y e ar s `` , it is said that e c on o m y in J a p an is also in a st age of re ce s s ion .
I he ar go ver n ment and the part ies in p ow er have be g un to study in st it ut ing addition al e c on o m ic po l ic ies .
P e op le want effect ive po l ic ies not l i p s er v ic e .
I think tru e a ut um n has come at last .
When I read this b ook , I thought that my v o c a b ul ar y of English is l ow le ve l .
I re pe at ed ly con s ul ted an English - J a p an e se di ction ar y .
This b ook ' s picture s are very pretty .
I enjoy ed read ing this b ook , but I thought that I want to study English very hard .
On ce you us e a M a c you can not go back to W in d ow s P C s , because a M a c is us e ful , s m ar t and so co o l .
To u ch p ad s on M a c la p t op s re c o g n i z e the number of f ing er s on it .
If you have an i P h on e I strong ly re c o m m en d you to bu y a M a c .
This was because an even t was he l d there .
My first j o ur n al on L an g - 8 .
But there is no time to us e my English in da i ly life .
So , on L an g - 8 , I want to co m m un ic ate with n at ive English speak er s and im p ro ve my English s k i ll s ! !
I can tea ch you my n at ive language , J a p an e se , too !
I ho pe I have time to me e t all kind s of people here on L an g - 8 .
A ccord ing to my ex pe ri ence , the ra in y sea s on might end before the middle of J u ly . . .
I ho pe it will end before the 3 day week - end s !
What will I be do ing d ur ing the ho l i day s ?
I ' ll have to think about it : )
No w , I ' m eat ing sp a g he t t i for dinner .
I c ook ed it myself .
F ir st , I bo il ed the noodle s for six minute s .
Then , I mi x ed the noodle s with t un a .
F in ally , I po ur ed so y so ur ce over the noodle s and d ust ed it with a piece of dr i ed bo n it o .
`` J a p an e se noodle s `` are finish ed !
It ' s very de l ic i ous .
As I commen ted on my di ar y from M ar ch 2 7 , a ma g a z in e re p or ter and a p h ot o g r a p h er came to our g y m and got a story .
F in ally , I b ough t the ma g a z in e to day !
P le a se c he c k out my J a p an e se b l o g if you have an interest in either K en d o , m us ic or J a p an e se life .
To day we went to c ity ha ll ( the In d ust i al C ul t ur al C ent er ) for the en v ir on ment al e c o l o g y no m in ation even t .
We are an en v i ro ment ally con s c i ous family !
I could not believe that I receiv ed the no m in ation .
To day was very ex c it ing and enjoy able .
I ' m a so f t spoke n person , and some time s people c a n ' t he ar me , es pe c i ally in no is y place s .
There are ti p s and a d v ic e for people who have the same pro ble m . ( It sound s o k a y without a d d ing anything . You could also say : `` people who have the same pro ble m I do . `` )
S m o ke a pack of c i g ar e t te s every day , y e ll all the time . . . .
Yes ter day , I went to a No r a e b an g ( a room for s ing ing in S .
K or e a , a little different from k ar a o ke in J a p an ) to feel better .
The se days , I have been a b it de p re s s ed .
My English does n ' t see m to get better , es pe c i ally in speak ing , and I also felt bad when my favor ite e ng l ish teacher kept saying ' I c a n ' t he ar you . ' last class .
When I s an g so ng s there , I re al i z ed that my voice is not quiet ( b as ic ally / natural ly ) , just I usual ly talk quiet .
I will try to speak loud er as much as possible .
I may feel like I ' m y el ling , but I also not ic ed that it is not when I re c or d ed and heard my voice .
I ho pe you enjoy good f o o d and have f un on T h an k s g i v ing D a y !
In my sp ar e time , I of ten r ent some come d ies , not only the new one s , but also the old class ic mo v ies .
E s pe c i ally d ur ing those time s when I en c o un ter a s ad or un ha p p y thing , I would like to watch a come d y .
And then I would for g e t those an no y ance s , and become ha p p y .
We watch come d y not just for f un , but also to get some life p h il o s op h y .
There is much we can le ar n from him - - not only from his mo v ies , but also from the person himself .
I have been work ing for ex a c t ly one year now .
S in ce I started work ing , I have dis c o ver ed a f e w dis ad v ant age s / we a k ness es in myself .
I made some mistake s d ur ing the pro ce s s of work and felt un ha p p y about it at the time .
A c t u ally , I care about so many things regard ing my work .
I do n ' t know why I care so much .
I did n ' t know I had the se kind s of we a k ness es when I was a st ud ent .
B y the way , it ' s very different between the part time and the full time job , so I do n ' t have any p re s um p tion s at work any m or e .
A n y op p or t un it ies for work ing are good , so try and see which one might be s u it able for you .
It was ra in ing , so I went to the near est st ation in my c ar , after I took my so n to kind er g ar ten .
( U s u ally , I go there with my b i ke to ex er c is e . )
I had expect ed there would be only me in this less on , but another train er was there .
She went there from another c ity where this less on was he l d before .
a ccord ing to her , It took about 4 0 minute s with a limit ed express train .
B e f or e the begin of the less on , we cha t ted some .
We spoke about our life .
She entered at the high school in A ust r al i a , she gradua ted and then entered at the co ll e g e there .
A fter she came back in J a p an , she work ed in a hotel .
On ce I us ed to work in the hotel ' s s ta f f . )
about the less on , it was cha ll e ng ing , but re w ar d ing , like the last time .
; D We have to le ar n the teaching me th o d s in a short time and do a l ot s of home w or k s every time .
There are 2 4 hour s in a day . . . .
Well , I should n ' t ne g le c t my ro ut in e of English study , so I can re fresh my English s k i ll s .
I went to the B e i j ing M us e um of N at ur al H is t or y to day and it was very ex c it ing .
A p p ar ent ly , it is p op ul ar with kid s , but I think it is also a good place for a d ul t s to le ar n more about M o ther N a ture .
S c i ent is t s found that in the last fifty year s of t w ent i e th c ent ur y , hu n d r ed s of th ous and s of sp e c ies had become ex t in c t on e ar th .
As a re s ul t , when s c i ent is t s st ud i ed the six ma s s ex t in ction s of or g an is m s in natural history , they found s ur p ri s ing ly that the e ar th is ex pe ri en c ing the se ve n th ma s s ex t in ction of or g an is m s right now .
F e a ture s of The S e ve n th M as s E x t in ction of O r g an is m s
The past six ma s s ex t in ction s all happen ed over th ous and s or mi ll ion s of year s a g o , where as the c ur r ent ra te of sp e c ies ex t in ction , a ccord ing to c al c ul ation s , is much great er comp ar ed to before .
The ex t in ction of mo d er n or g an is m s is d u e to hu man ' s act i v it ies .
H um an s are the only sp e c ies that can cause the ma s s ex t in ction s of other sp e c ies in the history of life .
P e op le ' s e c on o m ic act i v it ies like the over - ex p l o it ing of for est s and ex ce s s re c la m ation le ad to the cha ng ing of en v ir on ment of other sp e c ies .
P o ll u tion from hu man act i v it ies end an g er the s ur v i v al of w il d l if e .
B e c a us e of the p op ul ation ex p l o s ion , people are comp e ting with an im al s for re s o ur ce s , which also re s ul t s in their ex t in ction .
S t ar ting yesterday , I am now in the t est week s , so I have to study for a t est I will take at school .
So I am too bu s y to up d ate my di ar y . . .
We had a meeting with our big c l i ent in their office to day .
It was my first time there .
They have a big bu il d ing in Y ot u y a of Tokyo and they own all of the floor s .
I ' ve been work ing for more than 1 0 hour s to day !
but I keep on study ing English !
I ' ve de c id ed to stay a w a ke for as long as possible .
I was h ed my s is ter ' s c ar .
It was very di r ty because no one has dr ive n the c ar for at least one month .
It is now c le an .
If I could have dinner with any f a m ous person , I would ch o o se D r .
He is a J a p an e se do c t or , p h ot o g r a p h er and a pro f es s ion al of in ter n ation al co op er ation .
A fter he ga in ed ex pe ri ence in a me d ical N G O in S i er r a L e on e and A f g h an is t an , he set up the N P O `` E ar th the S p a ce s h i p `` .
He act ed in a po s it ive manner to in c re a se the number of people who became interest ed in g l o b al co op er ation .
I ' ve read all of his b ook s ? and I felt he show ed me conc ept s that help ed g u id e my life .
So , I want to talk with him about g l o b al d y n a m ic s , hu man life and so on at a dr in k ing sp ot over a light me al .
at ash i w a n i h on g o no be n k y o u w o ga m b ar im as u .

Well , go straight unti l you re a ch the first sign al and turn left , then you will find a sub way entrance .
Then go to U en o st ation with H i b i y a line and change train to G in z a line there .
F in ally , go to T or an o m on st ation and walk to w ar d s a big ho s p it al called to r an o m on ho s p it al .
I ' m sorry I ' m not so f a m il i ar with this place .
C o ul d you as k another person when you get close ?
I ' ll try to face and so l ve the pro ble m , No te : C a p it al I
He will qu it his job at our office at the end of M ar ch .
He is le aving for another job .
He and I have been at the same gr o up for about five year s , since 2 0 0 5 .
He was our gr o up le ad er .
There f or e , I was sh ock ed and felt somewhat be t r a y ed when I heard the new s of his change of job .
But it is also tru e that I respect him a l ot as a good e ng in e er and I like him as a good el d er friend .
A n y way , we will mi s s him .
A l th ough I work hard every day just like the ma in character ,
I wonder if I ' m ga in ing ex pe ri ence for my future .
In the end , she was pro m ot ed and got a n ic e bo y f ri en d in the mo v i e .
I know that re al life does n ' t go as great as a mo v i e .
However , I think of my life and I do my be st .
or may b e I write all po st s c or re c t ly ? ) ) I don t think so ) )
I w an n a me e t for e i g n er s and make friend s .
And le ar n new language s between us all .
My F ir st D i ar y ! !
No w I am study ing English s ic n ce I go to A m er ic a next month .
I ' m very ex cited but
I ' m w or ri ed if I can speak English .
So I am study ing English now .
My friend told me about this sit e .
Well , I go to A m er ic a with my friend and we will stay for one month .
I went there once when I was in high school .
A t that time , I was 1 7 year s old .
My friend and I stay ed with our ho st family and we had a very good time .
I a p p re c i at ed my ho st family since I had very good time . I came to like A m er ic a more .
This time , I want to go to visit my ho st family and tell about my life after that .
A n y way I us e this sit e about for month to im p ro ve my English .
I am glad if any on e c or re c t s my di ar y .
It told me that I can us e this we b s ite to p r a c t is e my writing .
I have n ' t written in my da ir y for a long time .
S in ce I had a co l d I did n ' t get up e ar ly .
I ' ve been w a k ing up at 6 in the morning re c ent ly .
To day I help ed some on e to get their proper ty back .
It was on a t able where people eat f o o d s .
Some on e for g ot that b an k b ook .
B e c a us e I saw the comp an y name inside that b ook .
I went to the b an k and return ed the b ook .
I am ha p p y that I could help people to day .
To day , I went to the J o b S e ar ch C ent re with the ne ce s s ar y do c u ment s .
I w o ke so e ar ly and it was even before my al ar m clock ra ng ( went off ) .
R e c ent ly I always w o ke in the middle of the night .
S in ce it was too e ar ly , I la id down again .
The C ent re is about ten - minute ' s walk from the near est st ation .
There were some people wait ing for their turn , so I p ic k ed up a re ce p tion she e t and wait ed for my turn .
A fter the re ce p tion ( con s ul t ation ? ) I got an in t ro d u ction c ar d for my a p p l ic ation for a new job .
It is the job of a re ce p tion is t at a hotel in As a ku s a which is far from my a p ar t ment .
I will receiv e a call on whether they p l an to have an in ter v i e w with me .
They will make the de c is ion if they are going to e m p l o y ( hi re ) me .
I am old and only had a f e w good job s in my care er .
So it is difficult to get a new job but I must not los e ho pe .
I want to im p ro ve my English writing .
I ' m a st ud ent in the be i j ing .
but I want to le ar n about e ng l ish . e ng l ish is very good .
because I will go study a b ro ad .
so , I ho pe that every on e will help me with my e ng l ish .
I ' ve st ud i ed English for so long that I can listen and understand what n at ive speak er s say .
But I have to a d m it , I c a n ' t speak well enough .
I want to re a ch the le ve l where I can make a good present ation in front of an a ud i ence .
Some time s I become de s p er ate and feel that no body can a ch i e ve that le ve l unless you live d in other co un t ri es when you were you ng .
But that idea is wrong .
I came to that conc l us ion when I saw a present ation by a p re s id ent of a comp an y .
He gradua ted from an A m er ic an business school .
But he had n ' t been to the U S before business school .
He did an ex ce ll ent present ation about his ex p er t is e and his business .
He answered all the question s with a sen se of hu m or .
No w I believe that I can be a good English speak er some day if I keep study ing .
C h op st ic k s are a f a m ous As i an tra d i tion al too l for eat ing .
The are made of w o o d .
S h o ul d not ( sp e ar the f o o d ? ) .
I ' ve live d in J a p an since I was b or n , but it is difficult for me to p ic k up f o o d as small as a so y b e an .
I think it is ne ce s s ar y that I should p r a c t ic e more .
This new s pro g r a m us es e as i er English than `` a b c N E W S `` .
D o you know about it ?
The se must have re f le c ted themselves in her feel ing s .
I ' m going to go to the Tokyo for the A ll J a p an J H S ch or us comp e t i tion , so I will leave my house e ar ly in the morning .
I will ar r ive no on and go to the N H K conc er t ha ll .
A fter A ll J a p an J H S ch or us comp e t i tion , I want to have f un with my friend s .
The question I of ten want to as k a for e i g n er
What cause s a person to leave his home t ow n and go to a place where even the language is different ?
M an y answer s would probab ly be to le ar n a new language .
But it must take a l ot of co ur age .
If your friend is going to a new country , what a d v ic e will you give to him or her ? like ex pe ri ence or some th ng else
I just became a me m b er of this sit e .
I am a to t ally new b i e , like a b a b y de er try ing to get up on his feet
so sp an k me up ( ? ) to become a good English write r .
P le a se c or re c t them if they are very wrong , or if there is a better way to say it .
I ho pe I get us ed to this soon er . . .
but is this c or re c t ?
He re ' s another question .
C h ri st m as is over
No w C h ri st m as is over and I feel re l i e f .
I got mar ri ed to a C an ad i an guy .
A n y way C h ri st m as is over . . .
As you know , there have been many e ar th qu a ke s in J a p an .
In the To h o ku re g ion , people have been s u f f er ing from dis e a se , and short age of f o o d and water , because of the t s un a m i and the e ar th qu a ke .
However , I live in Ka n a g a w a per f e c ture , which is far from To h o ku re g ion .
There f or e , I can s up p or t people in the re g ion only by don ation and s aving p ow er .
I feel I ' m p ow er less .
So , I think they are also s u f f er ing .
I tri ed to get in to u ch with them over and over , but I could n ` t .
I ' m very w or ri ed about my re l at ive s .
As I c a n ' t get in to u ch with them , all I have to do is to p r a y that they are al ive and he al th y .
We entered the big gra ve y ar d and the p it ch - dark t un n el one pai r at a time on a da re .
We walk ed the s and y be a ch on the way .
I like the sea at night .
The mo on and star s that night were very beautiful .
The mo on was b ri g h t , so we were n ' t in the dark .
So the t est of co ur age did n ' t s c ar e me .
B e c a us e I just re g is ter ed on L an g - 8 .
I think this is a re ally n ic e we b - sit e for le ar n ing language s .
I want ed to find out more about this before .
by the way , will some on e re ally c or re c t my di ar y ?
To day , a f a m ous J a p an e se act re s s was place d on the want ed l is t .
He r name is `` No ri p i `` . She is 3 8 year s old .
T w o days a g o , another f a m ous act or , `` O s h i o man a b u `` , was ( also ) ar re st ed as a s us pe c t .
A l ot of people feel s ad about that , but other s ( or : but other people ) feel am us ed .
W h o will catch her . . .
I c ar ry it with me all the time .
I look up a l ot of w or d s when I ' m on d ut y or study ing every day .
It always help s me and it ' s a ne ce s s ity for me .
O h , it ' s a big pro ble m .
I suppose , I us ed it too much , or it has just re a ch ed the end of it s life .
H a ve you ever heard of it ?
It is very f a m ous in J a p an .
I play b as ke t b a ll , so I can e m p a th is e with character s .
You can enjoy it even without a know led g e of b as ke t b a ll .
[ T a i w an was a ] f f e c ted by the out er b and of T y p h o on `` P ar m a `` , T a i w an had a l ot of ra in over the week en d .
It has been ra in ing for 3 days in a r ow .
In s te ad of a dr i z z le , it ' s to r r ent i al ra in .
The sound of the ra in hi t ting the e a ve s w o ke me up in the middle of the night s ever al time s .
And the most im p or t ant fact is that my c l o th es have not dr i ed yet .
I have to sub m it a p l an for my the s is by the end of M a y .
But I ' m still wonder ing what them e I should ch o o se .
I started us ing this because I want to im p ro ve my English .
F ir st , I want to in t ro d u ce myself .
I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent ma j or ing in English and A m er ic an litera ture , so I ' m interest ed in le ar n ing about other co un t ri es .

B e a ut y and the B e a st - C ha p ter One
On ce , there was ri ch me r ch ant in a big town .
The two el d er d aught er s were u g ly and gr e ed y ,
but the you ng est d aught er was different .
E ver y th ing about her was beautiful .
But , B e a ut y was still than k ful for everything .
They family had to work .
So , he went to the p or t ,
but soon le ar n ed the last sh i p was ro b b ed by p ir ate s .
5 / 1 1 / 2 0 1 0 .
I got the job and started to work after the in ter v i e w .
I work with an ar t de s i g n er in an office .
He is an easy going person .
It is bu s y , and I have to le ar n many things .
I also have to p r a c t ic e the de s i g n so f t w ar e `` I ll ust r at or `` more . + A d o b e I ll ust r at or ? +
I work from 1 0 : 0 0 a m to 5 : 0 0 p m , then I go to school after work .
I feel very tired , and I c a n ' t conc ent r ate on my b ook .
N e x t week we will start to p re p ar e for the mi d - ter m ex a m .
And I also wish to have more time to p r a c t ic e `` s al s a `` da n c ing .
I ho pe everything will go s m o o th ly in the future .
To day , I watch ed a mo v i e , `` O c t o b er S k y . ``
The mo v i e ' s ma in character is a bo y called H ome r .
The bo y was b or n and raise d in a co al - mi n ing town .
He has a dr e a m , to be a r ock e t s c i ent is t , and in the end he does .
The bo y ' s big g est o b st a c le is his father .
But H ome r ch o se his own life , not his father ' s .
It ' s an interest ing mo v i e .
A f e w days a g o , I watch ed `` F or re st G um p `` , which I had b or r ow ed from a r ent al sh op .
I w o n ' t de s c ri b e the de ta il s of this f il m , because if you have never watch ed it I want you to watch it .
I have been tak ing a voice train ing less on since 2 0 0 9 .
I be l on g to the M ar ke ting di v is ion at work , so I of ten make a present ation
to pro m o te the s al es of our pro d u c t s .
In J a p an , most people ten d to like a high p it ch ed voice , but I did n ' t have that .
F or an at t r a c t ive present ation , I thought it was im p or t ant to be able to make a speech with a clear voice .
That is why I started to take train ing .
No w , many different a ud i ence s prais e my present ation s .
I was to t ally put out when I got out of my last la b class on F ri day .
When my class was over , I was cha t ting on F a ce b ook with my friend and s ud d en ly one of the my class m ate s came to me and started shout ing and c ry ing .
I sea r ch ed B B C new s and it was un b el i e v able . O h G o d , what you have done ?
Then I re al i z ed that G o d has always c ur s ed people .
If he did n ' t want the living being s then why did he c re ate all of us to see this ty pe of even t . I am to t ally a ng ry with G o d .
I know some people do bad things , but some are help ful to other s .
Where is G o d ? I do n ' t believe he is very kind to the c re a ture s he c re at ed .
O h , G o d , I hu m b ly request that you please stop the se f e ar ful , dr e ad ful things . D o n ' t c r us e your so n if you are re ally a G o d .
No father will ever want his so n to be trouble d . Then why are you so un k in d ?
If we make a little mistake , give us a little punishment . But the people of j a p an are so kind and la b or i ous , you c a n ' t explain .
I felt that I ga in ed gr ound v it al ity when I ex er c is ed to str e ng th en the a b d o m in al m us c le s .

I wonder if my body will be straight .
I think there are many mistake s in gra m m ar , I would a p p re c i ate it if you could point out my mistake .
I ' m comp le te ly b ro ke since I ar ri v ed in J a p an .
I should n ' t have go ne tra ve ling in A ust r al i a with my friend if I want to s a ve some money but of course I could n ' t do that .
It ' s our first and po s s i b ly last time to tra ve l there .
I do n ' t know what will happen in the future [ ? ] , so I ch o se to us e the money .
It was the right de c is ion .
O ur tri p was such an ex c it ing , sp e c i al time for us .

But I ' m having a little trouble .
I want be sure to call them before ( more / too much ) time pass es .
My friend got mar ri ed ! !
My friend got mar ri ed last M a y .
That friend is the same age as me ( 2 2 year s old ) , so I was a little surprise d .
In J a p an , people usual ly get mar ri ed at around 3 0 year s old .
In your country , how old are people when they get mar ri ed ?
I ga in ed more we i g h t this year than last year . ( - - ; )
So , I de c id ed to c le an up the close t for my new pai n ting st ud i o for s um m er time .
A l th ough I do n ' t like c le an ing , after I finish ed c le an ing up the k it ch en , I felt re fresh ed .
I can read .
So I want to study here .
I ' m not good at gra m m ar .
The di ction ar y was us ed , I may be wrong .
W o n ' t you c or re c t my English ?
My so n s and I went to J J c l u b . `` the `` J J c l u b
We read some b ook s for an hour or so .
H ence I make it a r ul e to speak to myself about what happen ed to me d ur ing / through o ut the day .
I ho pe I will be able to m aster it this way .
S ur f ing is the most im p or t ant thing in my life . . .
I l o ve s ur f ing but s ur f ing is very s im i ll ar to dr u g s .
It is very a d d ic ting .
S ur f ing is good for tra ve ll ing the world and sea r ch ing for different be a ch es .
T h an k you for your pro m p t re p ly .
E T S is the most e f f ic i ent in st it u tion I have ever see n .
I de e p ly a p p re c i ate that you take n the time to consider my pro ble m .
But I ha ve one more question about the pro ce s s of cha ng ing my name .
My sit u ation is that I did n ' t know ( that ) I had made a mistake on my name unti l the s ta f f of the t est c ent er told me , which was just before the t est began .
So my question is the follow ing :
`` I s the t est c ent er o b l i g at ed to re p or t to E T S if they dis c o ver an in c on s is ten c y between the re g is ter ed name and the name on the st ud ent ' s pass p or t ? ``
I as k this question because I have some friend s who had also made a similar mistake on their name , however , the s ta f f of the t est c ent er help ed them re p or t it to E T S .
Even t u ally , all of them had their name s c or re c ted success ful ly !
( O k a y , let ' s get / ) G o ing back to my question .
If your answer is `` Y E S `` , then I could see k da m age s from the t est c ent er where I took the t est .
( B e c a us e of / ) D u e to their ne g l i g ence , I had sp ent U S D 1 6 0 and got nothing !
My T O E F L s c or e is in v al id be c a us they did n ' t have my name c or re c ted !
If your answer is `` N O `` , then I will have do u b t s on the re l i ability of E T S .
In other w or d s , any on e could have re p la c ed me to take the t est .
The s ta f f at the t est c ent er knew that there was a mistake on my name , but they still let me to take the t est .
I am just a poor st ud ent who want s to study a b ro ad .
I only e ar n U S D 3 5 0 per month , and the t est co st me almost half my salary .
A ll I want is f a ir treat ment .
I know it was my own mistake to begin with .
But there are other s who have made the same mistake s and then had their name s / mistake s c or re c ted .
They and I have the same pro ble m but we end up with different con se qu ence s .
T h an k you again for your pro m p t re p ly .
It is re ally a p p re c i at ed .
You r s since re ly ,
In the middle of the night I w o k en up by a ter ri ble sound .
J ust as I expect ed , there were new s re p or t s of f l o o d ing and da m age in the morning
J a p an and A ust r al i a are at 0 - 0 in the As i an C up f in al !
It ' s go n n a go into over time !
B e at A ust r al i a , J a p an , p le e e e e e a se !
B t w , why on e ar th is there no p i z z a de l ive ry at mi d night ?
My first time us ing L an g - 8
H i every on e , this is my first time us ing L an g - 8 .
My friend say s it ' s re ally help ful ,
so I want to try it : P I ' m not ( ent i re ly ) sure how it works .
I want to le ar n ing for m al English .
B e c a us e it ' s re ally a pro ble m for me .
I do n ' t know the di f f er ence s .
W o ul d you please give me some ex amp le s ?
T h an k s !
I of ten have had night m ar es since we b ro ke up .
There f or e , I am tired at work .
How long will this condition con t in u e ?
Yes ter day and the day before , I play ed in a b and .
The so ng I play ed was `` H E A V E N `` ( J an ne da ar c ) , `` G o d know s `` and `` E m p ty co l or days `` .
A fter I read an ar t ic le ti t led `` A re you ha p p y with life ? `` in a new s g ro up .
I asked myself .
I do n ' t re ally know whether I am ha p p y or not .
Some time s , I would like more pretty c l o th es even though I have have so many c l o th es already .
My mother always s c o l d s me , `` Why do you bu y so many c l o th es , but never we ar them `` He e he e , I do n ' t know why I just want to bu y them at that moment .
A fter I go home , I feel I have b ough t the wrong things and feel un s at is f i ed .
On the other hand , when my friend s are an no y ed with me , I will feel a ng ry for a f e w days .
But , after a week , I will feel nothing at all .
So , every little thing can make me ha p p y , and every little thing can make me de p re s s ed .
I do n ' t know how to answer this question .
To day I went to a re st a ur ant with my family .
It was the last ch ance we had to re st this s um m er .
My father said , `` Let ' s eat a de l ic i ous l un ch ! ``
We could eat anything for a th ous and yen but my father had 4 me al ti c ke t s , so we could eat for free ! : D
There was a l ot of de l ic i ous f o o d !
F or ex amp le , F re n ch c u is in e , C h in e se f o o d , J a p an e se f o o d and de s s er t ! !
I heart i ly at e my f i ll but my family at e more .
My father and brother at e three time s as much as I did !
It ' s ra in ing to day .
so I spoke s l ow ly .
I will study hard er in English pro n un c i ation tomorrow .
D e ve l op ed co un t ri es of ten give f in an c i al a id to poor / de ve l op ing co un t ri es , but this alone does not so l ve po ver ty . D e ve l op ed co un t ri es should also give other ty pe s of help to poor co un t ri es in s te ad of / in addition to f in an c i al a id .
C ur r ent ly , it is not un c o m m on for ri ch co un t ri es off er f in an c i al a id to the poor co un t ri es , for the s a ke of help ing them sha ke off ( over c ome ) po ver ty .
But the effort see m s to not be effect ive enough , and as a re s ul t many im po ver ish ed co un t ri es still s u f f er from po ver ty and other pro ble m s .
There f or e , in what for m of a id should be off er ed to the poor co un t ri es has been a to p ic of dis c us s ion .
Some people are con v in c ed that we al th y co un t ri es should off er a id in al ter n at ive for m s such as education or te ch no l o g y in s te ad of str ic t ly f in an c i al s up p or t .
There is no do u b t that one country can not de ve l op to be a strong one while it is always re ly ing on other co un t ri es ' help .
It is through the de ve l op ment of education and te ch no l o g y that one country can re ally push another country to become a we al th y one .
When a country is so poor that it can not de ve l op it s own education and te ch no l o g y by it s el f , the as s is t ance from ri ch co un t ri es can make a great im p a c t .
In d i a is a country which us ed to be so poor that it could not a f f or d the hu g e do m est ic co st , but it became more p ow er ful than ever before d u e to the de ve l op ment of comp ut er te ch no l o g y , which it be ne f it ted from the te ch no l o g y a id s receiv ed from de ve l op ed co un t ri es .
M an y poor co un t ri es re ly on direct f in an c i al s up p or t to re l i e ve p re s s ur es of po ver ty , which they can us e in different way s to all e v i ate the po ver ty , such as bu y ing f o o d s to co m b at hung er , or bu y ing mi l it ar y e qu i p ment for the st ability of the country .
In some case s , the c it i z en s of such co un t ri es will con t in u e to s u f f er from hung er and hard s h i p if f in an c i al a id is with d r a w n .
The ma in is s u e should be how the poor co un t ri es make good us e of the se a id s in or d er to im p ro ve the well - being of their c it i z en s .
I just le ar n t a new p h r a se , `` to the co re . `` So I would like to try and make some ex amp le sen t ence s .

I looked it up in the di ction ar y and found out that it mean s , `` That ' s right . ``
What I w an n a know , is this express ion is ch il d ish or not ?
If a d ul t s us e this sen t ence , is it strange ?
I could n ' t help him with much con f id ence because / since I know my English is n ' t per f e c t .
I did my be st , but it could still be im p ro v ed .

I ho pe I will become able to speak English f l u ent ly some day . . . . .
And I want to make friend s us ing this sit e : D
O h ! It ' s very co l d to day !

ha ha ! So what is the we a ther like to day in your country ?
W i ll you talk with me ?
T im e see m s to have no end .
And we are tra p p ed .
the time in our live s go by ,
Why no body c or re c t my di ar y ?
I w ro te three di ar ies , but only the first one was c or re c ted .
The other two are just there , I s us pe c ted that no on e read it .
I ho pe I can get im p ro ve ment from you all .
But now since no body c or re c t my comp o s i tion , I do n ' t know what mistake s I have made .
I ho pe you can read my di ar ies and give me a d v ic es .
I need to im p ro ve my English , , than k s .
M a y b e what I w ro te in v o l v ed something person al , but I ho pe you can c or re c t my mistake s , most on express ion s , language , and so on .
I got my accept ance letter the day before yesterday for an A m er ic an U n ive r s ity start ing in A u g ust , so I am going to a p p ly for a v is a soon .
B y the way , I took the T O E F L last week en d .
I was re ally sh ock ed because my speak ing s k i ll s has f al le n consider ably .
I re al i z ed that it ' s im p or t ant to con t in u e p r a c t ic ing con ver s ation da i ly in life .
I have de c id ed to try my be st to study English .
I will th r ow away my in f er i or ity comp le x and open my mouth .
B e c a us e I want to read original ed i tion b ook s and tra n s l ate them .
I want those who read b ook s I have tra n s la ted to understand what is said in the b ook s .
I do n ' t think `` ha ir `` is a co un t able no un when you ' re talk ing about the who le part on your head , so it c a n ' t be `` a ha ir `` . . .
It ' s re ally hot and hu m id now in Tokyo , and I could not end ur e this he at and hu m id ity with my ha ir which was pretty long for guy s .
A l s o I did n ' t go for a ha ir c ut for long time , so my ha ir was quite a b it long er than usual .
Well , it ' ll be e as i er to over c ome this s um m er he at ( or we a ther ) with this ha ir : )
A two - year - old b a b y un in ten tion ally sh ot his mother to de a th in A m er ic a .
It is a sh ame .
No w I ' m home and I ' m writing this di ar y after a long a b s ence .
To p ic of to day ' s di ar y is the even t of last S at ur day .
The we a ther of the day had been for e c as ted to be bad , but the day was a fine day ! !
My friend s and I went to a f a c il ity for B B Q ! !
A t the place / A t there , we at e some fresh fish and could see the sea at the same time .
And after that we went to a g en er al st or e , a c a f e , and so on .
Let ' s enjoy sp en d ing the re st of the ho l i day s ! !

To an or d in ar y C h in e se f ame r , can c er might the last i ll ness he want s to de al with .
What he e ar n s from hard work can only co ver his da i ly ne ce s s it ies .
They never as k for anything more in their live s .
A f e w week s a g o , he was di a g on s ed with having live r can c er .
G o ing to S ha ng ha i and get ting an op er ation can s a ve him .
This will co st at least 1 5 0 0 0 0 y u an .
Where will he get the money ?
We re l at ive s c a n ' t l en d him a hand , since we are all poor .
Even though C h in a is strong er than before , po la ri z ation of ri ch and poor is de e p er .
When will the me d ical ( he al th c ar e ) s y s te m be per f e c t ?
So that one day , f ame r s w o n ' t have to worry about i ll ness ?
K in d s of m us ic
She is try ing to c ook va ri ous f o o d s which she is interest ed in .
The se are some of her works .
I started work ing out since J un e so it ' s been almost five month s .
When I first thought of about re g is ter ing at the g y m , I he s it at ed .
S in ce I consider ed myself not so con s is t ent , I was afraid that it might end up as a was te of money .
I want ed if that could happen to me , too .
And I ga in ed 4 k g a month la ter .
I gue s s that is because of my bad eat ing ha b it s
M o st ly I eat s n a c k s and f o o d s with high c al or ies .
I went to eat a ha m b ur g er by b i ke .
That ' s all . It was good !
S el f in t ro d u ction
A l th ough it ' s l ate , let me in t ro d u ce myself .
My name is S at o m i .
I ' m interest ed in j a p an e se c ul ture . ( ex .
k a b u k i , u k i y o e , and j a p an e se idea s and so on )
And my favor ite act or is J o h n n y D e p p ! He is very co o l ! !
And my favor ite J a p an e se act or is W at an a b e K en .
This has a good effect on people in for e i g n co un t ri es who are study ing J a p an e se because many J a p an e se people will c or re c t their J a p an e se .
I ' m now watch ing a T V pro g r a m on some effect ive and e f f ic i ent way s
So the T V pro g r a m me e t s my need s .
However , something still re m a in s un c er tain .
That ' s whether I should take a ction or not .
They give me l ot s of p ow er and l o ve .
When I feel s ad , I talk with friend s at first hand .
And I also go sh op p ing and look for something ha p p y .
To day I w o ke up , and my da d said that we did n ' t have any e le c t ri c ity .
I did n ' t know what I could do all day .
I c le an ed , I st ud i ed .
I did some ex er c is es in S p an ish .
And I re al is ed , that I have to im p ro ve .
: S B e c a us e I do n ' t know so many w or d s , for ex amp le : e g g - hu e v o .
Y e a h it is very difficult , because I always say hu es o , which mean s bo ne .
And I re al is ed that people c a n ' t live without e le c t ri c ity , we need it all the time .
It ' s very s ad .
On ce we had e le c t ri c ity , I turn ed on the comp ut er and I did some t est s in e ng l ish , and I got 2 8 - 2 7 point s out of 5 0 .
I think it is bad .
I will go to E ng l and , and I ho pe that I will le ar n a little .
T h an k you for read ing or c or re c ting it .

We had a different teacher again to day .
A c t u ally in the past three days , we have had three different teachers . One for each day .
What our class did to day is ; we had a dis c us s ion about mar ri age in the morning class and then a v o c a b ul ar y qu i z .
F or the after no on class , we talk ed about person al it ies and then we watch ed a mo v i e .
I have to wait unti l M on day .
I have no after no on class tomorrow , so I ' m going to go D ow n t ow n for some sh op p ing and get something for L a m a , my ho st mother ' s gr and ch il d , for his b ir th day .
He ' s very funny , and a re al good guy .
He t aught me a l ot of s la ng w or d s & p h r as es so far .
He ' s going to back to P h in e as where he works and he will have his w ed d ing out there !
I wish him a s a f e tri p and a ha p p y w ed d ing .
I ' m read ing `` A C h ri st m as C ar o l , `` and I ' m wonder ing about whether there are any di f f er ence s between the English us ed 1 0 0 year s a g o and the English us ed now .
I can re c o g n i z e the di f f er ence between J a p an e se us ed 1 0 0 year s a g o and now easily .
How about in English ?
I s this any ( kind of ) all er g y ?
My so n is play ing a game on W i i this morning .
I want my ch il d re n ' s English to keep im p ro v ing .
My so n tri ed a S k y pe English L es s on , but he did n ' t like it .
This is my first letter . I live in R us s i a and study in school .
Some days a g o our English teacher told us about an ex change pro g r a m in the U S A for one year .
This i nformation appear s re a ll interest ing to me because I want visit the U S A to le ar n English !
Yes ter day I found some i nformation about this pro g r a m on the in ter ne t .
And I read that all students must have had some English st ud ies before . ( cha ll e ng es )
F ir st , a p p l ic ant s must pass the school ' s pro g r a m t est s .
If a part ic i p ant pass es the t est s , he or she must came here again after a week and write an es s a y for the second t est .
Then , when co m mission s de c id es that the a p p l ic ant did well , , you must write for more t est s .
What do you think ? C an I pass the cha ll e ng es ? ? ? = )
We want to believe that this name will help her .
I j o in ed L an g - 8 for f un
I will c or re c t J a p an e se di ar y , but this s er v ic e is a little bu s y . . . : - /
B e c a us e so many re st a ur ant s ( had ) put up `` V A L E N T I N E ' S D I N N ER `` a d s !
V al ent in e ' s D a y !
It was as s i g n ed by my teacher and I am going to present it next th ur s day .
A fter finish ing it , I soon f e ll as le e p .
S ud d en ly , I felt my be d sha k ing and the who le bu il d ing too !
I was too f ri g h ten ed to j um p out of my be d at that time because I had just come out of a dr e a m .
I thought about what I should do if the next big sha ke come s , like what stuff to b r ing with me and call ing my sleep ing mother .
F or t un ate ly , after a while it seemed like no more e ar th qu a ke s would come , and I soon f e ll as le e p again .
In fact the sit u ation has been quite f re qu ent in T a i w an , because the country is l o c at ed at an act ive se is m ic be l t .
It ' s not the first time for me , though .
I still felt s c ar ed , es pe c i ally because the ter ri ble one in C h in a had just happen ed .
It took so many people ' s live s , made th ous and s of people home less , and c r us h ed C h in a ' s e c on o m y .
I re ally can do nothing against nature .
M a y b e all we can do is accept it and be strong er .
We should not b l ame nature or anything else .
It ' s not the re ve ng e of the e ar th .
It ' s not a bad ome n for the 2 0 0 8 O ly m p ic s , either .
It is just a natural even t that hu man s have to get a c c ust ome d to .
I re ally p ity the v ic t im s of that e ar th qu a ke .
I ho pe they can get through the dis aster soon .
I went to Tokyo d ur ing w in ter va c ation .
I went to go see my father , I felt very c r ow d ed . I also we n to Y us h im a temple . A fter va ri ous p r a y er s I began to feel the im p or t ant c ul t ur al her it age .
I us e A ut o c ad .
This is a C A D us ing world .
A ut o c ad has S h or t c ut ke y ( s ? ) .
S h or t c ut ke y s are very con ve n i ent .
D o es any on e us e A ut o c ad ?
What is the di f f er ence between `` would n ' t `` and `` did n ' t `` in the sen t ence of my te x t ?
This time , my question is about the di f f er ence of mean ing between two p h r as es .
The other is `` I [ did n ' t ] know the di f f er n ce . ``
So , you said to me `` You w or e my sh o es home by mistake . ``
I said to you `` I would n ' t have know n the di f f er ence ``
And how do the two p h r as es change the mean ing ?
C o ul d you tea ch me the di f f er ence between the two p h r as es ?
I think you will say `` What happen ed `` ?
Yes ter day , I sen s ed that my comp ut er could n ' t in p ut sound s from line - in .
( That is very bad . If nothing is done about it , I c a n ' t comp o se sound t r a c k s . )
I thought it was a dr ive r is s u e and re in st al led the sound dr ive r s .
But , that was wrong and now I ' m try ing to re in st a ll the O S .
I in st al led the dr ive r . . .
. . but , my comp ut er still c a n ' t re c or d anything . . .
That a ction was wrong , too . . .
I just do n ' t w an n a be alone .
D a m n it . . .
I was s n ow b or d ing .
It was f un .
But my m us c le s are tired because of my age .
I am old er than before .
I have an a d in ter v i e w .
B e c a us e I had such a great in ter v i e w last night .
To day I ' m in a bad mo o d because it is ra in ing .
I c a n ' t go outside .
It is a co m ic ( man g a ) about b as ke t b a ll .
H a ve you heard of it ?
M e an w h i le they say g l o b al w ar m ing is get ting w or se and that the e ar th is get ting w ar m er and w ar m er .
O ur history is less than . 0 0 0 0 0 2 per c ent of the e ar th ' s history .
They say hu man being s are da m a g ing the e ar th , which I think is may b e tru e .
D ur ing a two night s ' stay , we s k i i ed 2 hour s in the morning and in the after no on too .
The first time , the s n ow was p ow d er y , but la ter it became ar t if ic i al .
We enjoy ed the education al school tri p .
I ' d like to work in Z a m a c amp .
B e c a us e , I like the English L an g u age and U S .
But I c a n ' t speak English very well .
A friend of mi ne said that English was easy .
I understood that it was a with d r a w al s y m p t o m of qu it ting s m o k ing when I in ve st i g at ed the cause .
But , I have to keep myself from s m o k ing !
To day I want to talk about one more of my ho b b ies .
I became interest ed in it when I was in f ir st year ( I ' ve just finish ed the th ir d year now ) .
I don ` t know whether you know about this game .
This game was c re at ed in B el ar us by M r .
The b as ic idea of game con s is t s of the perform ance of va ri ous ta s k s for dis t ri c t s for a while .
The w in n er of the game is the play er or the command that is the first to finish all of the le ve l s .
T h us the qu ant ity of ta s k s , se qu ence of their perform ance , time for perform ance of one ta s k are not re g ul at ed by r ul es and are est a b l ish ed by the a u th or s under their dis c re tion .
The game take s place at night .
And all night your friend s and you tra ve l about the c ity , so l ve ri d d le s , sea r ch for co d es and t re as ur es in the most im p ro b able place s .
It can be both in the un c o m p le ted bu il d ing and in the ga r age s .
It usual ly take s ( me ) some time to write down my idea s and thought s .
G r ad students are require d to have some a c ad e m ic s k i ll s .
R e ad ing and writing are the most im p or t ant , and may b e dis c us s ion s k i ll s as well .
A n y way , I ' ll try to write something on here as much / of ten as possible , at least keep do ing it for a while .
No w I ' m think ing about what I am going to write . .
What is the different n u ance ?
I had a pro d u c t ive day ( when ? ) and it was hu m id yesterday .
B y the way , I have n ' t p re p ar ed for th e N e w Y or k tri p yet , first I want to bu y a rather large s i z ed s u it c a se .
I am ant ic i p at ing a big one , one , which could make you feel so p ow er less when s ur r ound ed by it , and feel the be a ut y of nature and the im p ul se to c ry .
A ll you could see would be w h ite , w h ite , w h ite .
I must say I just ex pe ri ence d those feel ing s when I was , like 9 , walk ing in my p ri m ar y school c amp us with my mo m , with my hand in her s .
I can still re m e m b er the w ar m th of her hand .
F u ku s h im a is f a m ous for it s hot springs and it is n ' t far away from my house .
There are many hotel s , which have hot sp r ing public bath s , around the st ation there .
It ' s an open - a ir bath and was re ally n ic e and we re la x ed .
I wonder . C o ul d it be from the hot springs . . . ?
I am a con t r a c t e ng in e er .
I am always in the office for my work , but not to day as I first had to go to work sit e with an
e le c t r ical e ng in e er .
O ur work is to bu il d M e t ro .
I like my job , I think it ' s interest ing .
I tra ve led around three co un t ri es from 2 6 th A p ri l to 4 th M ar ch .
I went to V i e t n a m , L a o s and C a m b o d i a .
I ' m going to write an ent ry in my j o ur n al about my tri p tomorrow .
To day I ' m writing about my great est impress ion .
It was a last day on my tri p
and I had I cha r ter ed a t u k t u k to go sight se e ing .
I went to the L and M in e M us e um ,
which is a small m us e um .
It is p ri v ate ly own ed by A k i R a , who was ch il d so l d i er for the K h y m er R o gue .
No w he want s to re m o ve all of the l and mi ne s in C a m b o d i a .
A l ot of l and mi ne s that were re m o v ed by A k i R a are on display in the m us e um .
M an y c i v il i an s were s l aught er ed by the K h y m er R o u g e .
There are so many v ic t im s ' bo ne s and s ku ll s in the me m or i al to w er .
I talk ed with the t u k t u k dr ive r about a l ot of things .
He told me about the K h y m er R o u g e , P o l P ot and so on .
He spoke English f l u ent ly and J a p an e se a little .
We spoke in a mi x ture of English and J a p an e se .
I wonder ed why he had n ' t become a to ur g u id e .
He said `` If you want a good job , you need a l ot of money in C a m b o d i a .
H on est ly , C a m b o d i a is a c or r up ted so c i e ty . ``
I wonder about my life .
A t the same time , I also felt va in since I do n ' t think that I am quite as b ri ll i ant .
So , I de c id ed I would be b ri g h t , just like that f l or al ar r an g e ment .
It is T h ur s day from s te a m y J a p an
How is every on e going to sp en d their s um m er va c ation ?
What would you want to do if you could take the ent i re s um m er off work ?
As for me , I would like to sp en d time read ing ar t b ook s at my favor ite c a f e , while dr in k ing a c up of sp ic ed tea ; or I would take a tri p to a place I have never visit ed .
My name is A y an a !

I just want to have a ha p p y family .
T h an k you for read ing ! !
the se sound like only small change s , but I strong ly believe the se will le ad to big im p ro ve ment .
I found that when I can f o c us on my work , I ' m sit ting up and feel my head is clear .
I take e ng l ish class es .
B e c a us e I want to tra ve l and talk to people from other co un t ies .
There are some of my class m ate who are in the e ng l ish class .
We ( My hu s b and and I ) will have go back to J a p an on A u g ust 3 r d , but my hu s b and ' s work is going to finish e ar l i er than that .
We have p l an s go to S e at t le from J u ly 7 th for 4 days ( A c t u ally 3 night s stay ) , so we de c id ed go back to J a p an on J u ly 1 3 th .
L e f t - H and ed
I ' m left - hand ed ( person ) .
M an y year s a g o , in J a p an , left - hand ed people were ra re .
There is a reason for this .
M an y p ar ent s thought that left ies would le ad in c on ve n i ent live s because most too l s are made for right - hand ed person s for ex amp le .
They for c ed their ch il d re n to us e their right hand s .
In fact , I had trouble c ut ting things with s c is s or s , and my p ar ent s made me us e my right hand .
H a p p i ly ( ? ) I have been writing and us ing too l s with my left hand .
However , re c ent ly many teachers in J a p an have point ed out that the number of left - hand ed ch il d re n is in c re as ing .
We had a hand - rolled s us h i - part y .
You can ch o o se your own ing r ed i ent s and put them and ri ce on la y er of sea w e ed and ro ll it by your s el f .
But I heard that many E ur o pe an s and A m er ic an s do n ' t like sea w e ed .
My K or e an friend ga ve me the re c i pe and I made it and serve d it that day .
I ' m ha p p y to day
My b ro k en le g is get ting better and better so I can mo ve around with it , which feel s good .
A l s o , the C h in e se st ock make t came back from r ock bo t t o m to day , so my st ock is up
3 point s . It ' s a l u c k y day to day , a p ar t from the hot we a ther .
I at e a sp ic y hot p ot on S un day no on , but because of c he w ing not easily so I just eat d u c k b l o o d and be an c ur d .
It is part ly because I w an n a pass the U n ive r s ity I want to , and part ly because I just l o ve English .
T h ough , U n f or t un ate ly , I c a n ' t speak English any m or e because of the lack of p r a c t ic ing speak ing English , I ' ll try to .
I wish to di e t ! ! ! !
D o you think about di e t s ?
F U J I which is the high est mo un tain in J a p an two days a g o .
But I became re fresh ed when I saw the view of the c l o ud sea as I re a ch ed the to p of the mo un tain .
I want to c l im b again !
What an am a z ing we b s ite !
So c i al ne t w or k s are a d v an c ing language le ar n ing .
On my way home , I b ough t a b ir th day present for my friend .
I ho pe it will make her ha p p y .
In the after no on I will get some ex er c is e in the p ar k near here .
I got some ex er c is e there yesterday too .
I like sp or t s .
When I was a ch il d , I play ed b a se b a ll .
I like b a se b a ll , s n ow b or d ing , and b as ke t b a ll , so I of ten watch them .
I will go to A m er ic a with my w if e next year .
I ' m 2 1 year s old .
I work for an e le c t ri c ity comp an y .
I like read ing po e t ry , watch ing f o ot b a ll game s and listen ing to m us ic .
I ho pe to make friend s from many co un t ri es .
J a p an e se people l o ve year - end dr in k ing part ies .
I have a l ot of the se part ies , ma b y e five or six .
There f or e , in your or g an i z ation , I can con t ri b ut e to the im p ro ve ment of ex p at ri ation pro g r a m m e by de m on st r at ing what is s u es J a p an e se ex p at ri ate s and their f a m il ies have face d and id ent if y ing how they can be sat is f i ed with their live s in the U K .
This ex pe ri ence will help me s m o o th ly work with in ter n ation al co ll e a gue s and c l i ent s in your g l o b al or g an i z ation al en v ir on ment .
A t six o ' clock , my D ad w o ke me up and we went walk ing , to get some ex er c is e , near the p ar k .
When we came back and stood in front of our home , the ne i g h b or ' s un c le open ed his do or and said he ll o to us .
It was very s c ar y !
It was a dis g ust ing thing for me because I am a s ever e c le an f re a k so I c a n ' t end ur e the to u ch of any an im al .
M an y people consider it a per f e c t ro m ance and that it can to u ch their so ul s .
The mo v i e make s them sat is f i ed about l o ve but I do n ' t think so .
It is so s ad and make s me un ha p p y .
every on e ,
But still I ' m not very good in speak ing and listen ing .
I will try to keep my da ir y here and ho pe you will give me commen t s .

A ccord ing ly , there is a strong po s s i b il ity of c ut ting the po l ic y ra te start ing in No ve m b er .
The se last f e w day have been a little hard time for me .
I think the reason why I got up se t is
I never thought it would become a pro ble m for me .

If you come to J a p an , you should eat at M I D O R I s us h i .
My school f est i v al ' s name is ' M o k - ry e on - j e ' .
C u z my school f est i v al is know n for many interest ing pro g r a m s .
I am in a f e m al e high school , but I can me e t ma le students d ur ing the school f est i v al . ( Y i p pe e ! )
M an y b and s from other ma le school s and B - B O Y tea m s will come to our f est i v al .
It is the first even t in the f est i v al .
S in ce this f est i v al will be the only f est i v al in our high school life , ( S ad ly , when we ' re sen i or s in H i g h S ch o o l , we c a n ' t even at ten d the school f est i v al . )
many girl s part ic i p ate in this one .
W o ul d you come to my school f est i v al ?
I went to My e on g - D on g with my bo y f ri en d yesterday .
We at e de l ic i ous f o o d and went w in d ow sh op p ing .
I want ed to bu y it , but I was put off by the p ri ce at first .
When we left the p u b , I re g re t ted not bu y ing the s w e at er , so I return ed to the st or e to bu y it .
However , the st or e was already close d , so I simpl y had to go home .
D es p ite going to watch A v at ar on M on day ,
To day I told my friend that `` A v at ar is a great mo v i e ! `` , so she said she want ed to go soon ! !
I did n ' t think that I would watch the mo v i e t w ic e .
but I would n ' t want to go a th ir d time .
Yes ter day , I at ten d ed a le c ture called the `` In ter n ation al C on t ri b u tion L e ad er T r a in ing P ro g r a m `` .
The pro g r a m started in M a y 2 0 0 8 .
And the pro g r a m end ed yesterday .
I change d because of this pro g r a m .
But I want to say only one thing , than k you very much ! !
A bout an a d v ic e .
D o you follow an a d v ic e when you asked for it ?
M o st of the people I know ten d not to .
I do n ' t j ud g e them - every on e know s that it ' s easy to give an a d v ic e to other s .
Some time s they just tell me : `` S or ry , but you do n ' t quite understand my sit u ation `` or `` T h an k you for your opinion , but it still see m s too compli c at ed for me , I need to think about it some more before I make any de c is ion `` .
But some time s it turn s just ri d ic ul ous .
My friend tell s me : `` I need your a d v ic e `` and at the moment I feel all im p or t ant and respon s i ble of the state ment .
- I was going some where with some body .
But then I let them down , and now they are against me .
I an a ly z e and try to find the be st w or d s to explain my point of view .
I think about my friend ' s and friend of her ' s feel ing s and do my be st to be un b i as ed .
I explain to her and when I finish I feel like my piece of a d v is e is n ' t a bad one .
And I know what it mean s : I ' d rather just p re ten d that nothing happen ed .
Well , but I ' m glad that her pro ble m was not that serious as she told me .
P e op le always need some s up p or t , but they never need any on e to tell them what to do !
That is my opinion about an a d v ic e ^ _ ^
The ha n a b i sea s on is S ept e m b er and A u g ust .
In J a p an , H A N A B I are di v id ed into H i g h - into - the a ir f i re w or k s and To y f i re w or k s .
A n old H A N A B I F est i v al is `` S um id a g a w a . ``
I am going to go to a H an a b i f est i v al in A u g ust .
With who m have you been to see f i re w or k s ?

In the morning , I will sit on the b an k of the H u on g ri ver and have some co f f e e .
T im e , please pass quick ly ! !
A little while a g o , I had a n i b ble of an a p p le .
If I was asked `` what is your favor ite f o o d ? `` , I ' d an s w e ar `` a p p le s are the be st `` .
T e ch n ic ally , my favor ite f o o d is not ex a c t ly a p p le s because there are many other de l ic i ous f o o d s which sat is f y my p al ate .
In J a p an , there is one saying that / which go es , `` A p p le s in the morning are go l d en a p p le s ``
F ro m a n ut ri tion al point of view , they con tain a l ot of f i b er s .
It mean s that eat ing them f a c il it ate s the di f f us ion of so l id ex c re ment s .
My favor ite b ook is called `` The c at with a mi ll ion live s ``
P le a se read the story be l ow .
There once was a c at who live d for a mi ll ion year s .
He di ed a mi ll ion time s and he live d a mi ll ion time s .
He was a sp le n d id ta b b y c at .
M i ll ion s of people l o v ed the c at .

One time , the c at was take n by the K ing .

I ' m not good at English , so I am writing an ent ry on `` L an g - 8 `` .
I will try to write sen t ence s in English .
What the He ll ?
How could such good we b sit es be b an n ed ?
They have no right to de ter m in e which sit es we access .
With o ut the se t re as ur ed so ur ce s , I can hard ly enjoy any v id e o s about ma g ic .
I can not believe it .
I can only us e pro x ies to get on the se we b sit es .
It ' s ter ri ble !
The se days I of ten read J a p an e se litera ture because they are in my new e le c t or on ic di ction ar y .
I like to read b ook s written by D a z a i O s a m u .
I could n ' t study English and I did n ' t write English sen t ence s .
I felt that it was ne ce s s ar y for me to con t in u e study ing English .
I had good time , it was a n ic e w ed d ing .
I stay ed over night and I went to N a g o y a c a st le which is f a m ous in N a g o y a .
It is es pe c i ally f a m ous for the go l d sha ch i h o k o on the N a g o y a c a st le .
We at e ic e - c re a m that ta st ed like mi s o . It was hot that day .
It was an interest ing ta s te .
I looked beautiful around N a g o y a st ation .
The e le c t ri c w ir es were bu ri ed under g r ound .
I was very tired but I had a good time .
We s l ept in the S h in k an s en ( s up er e x p re s s ) .
I want the same dress as in this picture .
I play ed the game of S h o g i , that J a p an e se tra d i tion al game .
S h o g i is similar to ch es s .
The number of play er s is two , and they play al ter n at ive ly ( in turn ) .

the number of play ing p at ter n s might be in f in ity .
Yes ter day I c aught this p h r a se in O b a m a ' s speech made at the G 2 0 in C ent r al L on d on .
F or me , part ic i p al con st r u ction s sound very O R quite for m al , hi ther t o I ' ve only see n them in written English or heard them in some on e ' s speech . .
O R or does it sound in a p p ro p ri ate for every day us e ?

What c r a z y we a ther !
The we a ther c a st said , it will s n ow again in M ar ch .
g l o b al w ar m ing is becom ing very serious .
P o ha ng does n ' t usual ly s n ow as much as it did this year .
It ' s hard to keep a ga r d en c le an particular ly in s um m er ,
when p l ant s gr ow th ic k .
If you do n ' t re m o ve the we ed s from your ga r d en for one week d ur ing s um m er , it ' ll soon appear like a j un g le .
And then , water ing them also become a pro ble m because of the short age of water .
In addition , we also have to get ri d of w or m s .
We all ro se our go ble t s ha p p i ly ex c ept one class m ate .
I asked the wait re s s if there was any gra pe f r u it j u ic e .
There is a desk , a be d and so on .
I think my room is a little me s s y , so I need to c le an it ( . ) .
What do you do in your room ?
I do many things in my room like study ing , s ur f ing the In ter ne t , sleep ing , read ing b ook s and so on .
I like this room the better than the other room s in my house .
He himself of the need to study .

F or ex amp le there were : A m er ic an , C h in e se , K or e an , A r a b i an , H is p an ic and J a p an e se .
The ra ng e of age was wide , be t w w en 2 0 and 6 0 .
I went to Ka r a o ke with the me m b er ( A co ll e a gue ? ) .
But I could not ch o o se the so ng every body would know and come al ive to .
G o to d ent is t
To day , J as on had an a p po in t ment with the d ent is t .
L a st time when we had come to c l in ic , he never stop p ed c ry ing , so we had had to go back home without treat ment .
A fter s n if f ing up the op i ate , he became like dr un k ar d .
He just looked so r t of dr a in ed , and then , he con t in u ed to smile and k is s me , and spoke mi x ed w or d s .
I should have re c or d ed his we ir d be ha v i or : D
To day I j o in ed L an g - 8 .
So , I think that I want to be able to speak English better !
A fter that , I j o in ed here .

I went to my co ll e g e for the first time to day .

S ame as for m er B ri t ish P ri m e M in s it er M ar g ar e t That ch er ( sp el ling ? ) , so I ' m also an ir on lady ! !
So many people are le ar n ing English and look ing for a teacher to c or re c t their language , but there are not so many n at ive English speak er s here . . .
It ' s f un for me to c or re c t sen t ence s for J a p an e se le ar n er s . P er ha p s I could conc ent r ate on c or re c ting their J a p an e se for a while and wait for more English speak er s to j o in L an g - 8 ! ?

A l s o I like `` P ri d e and P re j ud ic e `` by J an e A us ten .
When I was a st ud ent , I s u f f er ed from a c ne .
I ' ve never us ed an A m er ic an - made a c ne pro d u c t so it was difficult to he al from a c ne .

However , at first I want to get good point s on the T O E I C t est .
Some body please tea ch me English on this sit e .
I will keep writing my di ar y .
I have been writing in my English j o ur n al since I first began part ic i p at ing here at L an g - 8 .
To day , I f in ally w ro te my 1 0 0 th English j o ur n al ent ry !
I ' m very ha p p y , and it ' s a re al mi le st on e in my j o ur ne y to le ar n English .
I ' d like to con t in u e my English j o ur n al and re a ch the next mi le st on e : the 2 0 0 th ent ry !
I ho pe I will make it to my 2 0 0 th ent ry with in the next year .
Why did I ch o o se to work as an a u pai r ?
On the 1 5 th of J u ly last year I came to L on d on with the idea of work ing as a wait re s s , c le an er or something like that , so I re n ted a room in a sh ar ed house in an e aster n sub ur b of L on d on and started to look for a job .
One week la ter , I still did n ' t have she e t s in my be d cause my l and la d y had n ' t brought them yet .
for 4 people .
And , on to p of that , the show er head only work ed if you put it at no more than 1 0 c en time t re s from the bo t t o m of the bath .
But at the very least I like to have a show er stand ing up !
So , I c he c k ed all the po s s i b il it ies : a u pai r , hotel wait ing s ta f f , try ing another sh ar ed house , . . .
I thought about the pro s and con s of every ty pe of job and f in ally de c id ed to make an a u pai r pro f i le in a sp e c i al ty we b s ite and look for a family .
And that ' s the reason for why I end ed up work ing as an a u pai r .
( The next cha p ter will be about how I looked for a family )
I ' m b or ed , so I ' ll write something here ^ ^ .
C ur r ent ly , I have to stay at home because I ' m i ll ; _ _ ; I have the ch ic k en po x !
N e x t month I should be mo v ing out from my little c ity < f in ally ! > .
The big c ity is wait ing .
And make new friend s , y e a h !

P e op le with i nformation about them please me s s age me
I went s w im m ing this morning .
I have de c id ed to do sp or t s once or t w ic e a week .
K e e p ing this pro m is e is bu il d ing my con f id ence .
S ept e m b er start s from to day .
In A m er ic a , S ept e m b er is the first month of the f is c al ( school ) year , is n ' t it ?
( In J a p an , A p ri l is the first month not S ept e m b er ) .
My object ive for S ept e m b er is to be able to speak and write English more .
I want to live in A m er ic a after gradua ting from school : )
I talk ed about what I have le ar n ed about English on the In ter ne t .
I heard that there are 3 we b s ite s for study ing English .
f m so that I could me m or i z e a l ot of English w or d s for the T O E I C .
In the mean time , I want ed to talk in English us ing the w or d s that I had re tain ed from s m ar t .
No w I write a da i ly j o ur n al every day in English .
I ' m read ing the original .
The transfer is s ch ed ul ed from D e ce m b er 2 8 th to 2 9 th and we will la un ch the new office on F e b r u ar y 1 st .
To night the In ter ne t ' s sp e ed is very s l ow , so I found some down l o ad able v id e o s to watch .
And I just found that The big bang th o er y is so funny , no matter how many time s I have watch ed , I always laugh ed .
But the new est e p is o d e will come on A p ri l 1 st , it is too long to wait to watch it . It ' s re ally ter ri ble .
It is bad for the st o m a ch . If you want to los e we i g h t , you should keep ex er c is ing .
It has l ow c al or ies and high pro te in .
So some a th le te s who bu il d up their m us c le s and body of ten eat it .
How to make S as a m i f ry :
c ut ch ic k en into b ite s i z es
put a l it te s al t and pe p p er on the ch ic k en piece s
put c r um b s of b re ad on it
I think I need to le ar n English . . .
the w or d in ( a ) . . .
act u ally it ' s `` something `` in the b l an k , but gra m m at ic ally it is better to be `` anything `` , which we J a p an e se are always care ful about .
R e c ent ly , I ' m work ing very hard at part time job s to e ar n money .
F or ex amp le , I work ed at the b re ad sh op from 6 : 0 0 a m to 4 : 0 0 p m ex c ept between 1 0 : 3 0 a m to 1 1 : 3 0 a m as that is my b re a k . A fter that , I work ed at the ch in e se re st a ur ant from 6 : 3 0 p m to 1 0 : 0 0 p m .
To day , I work ed at b re ad sh op from 6 : 0 0 a m to 1 4 : 0 0 ex c ept for my 1 hour b re a k , and from 5 : 3 0 p m , I ' m going to go to the ch in e se re st a ur ant to work .
One of the s ter e o ty pe of J a p an e se is `` hard work ing `` , and I think I ' m just the s ter e o ty p ical J a p an e se now . : - (
In M ar 2 6 , I was p l an ing to go to P en s a c o la to see my old er s is ter , But this tri p was my the w or st and un f or g ot tri p .
F ir st I need to go to S e at t le - T a c o m a In ter n ation al A ir p or t and go to H ous t on to transfer the a ir p la ne , and the to u ble was coming : When the first f light was read y to f ly , the at ten d ant has told us that this p la ne was de te c ted a `` un p r ed ic t `` pro ble m on this p la ne and then they started to explain the question which the pass an g er asked .
A bout 2 hour s after , they said that the C on t i ent al A ir line could help us that change the another a ir p la ne so that we can go on tri p right away .
Then I have to back to the T er m in al and went to the another boarding ga te in or d er to I can go to P en s a c o la as quick ly as possible .
S h ar n ' s first trouble end ed .
In 8 : 3 0 I ar ri v ed in the H ous t on in ter n ation al A ir p or t , when I p re p ar ed to go to another b or ad ing ga te , the f light number and de st in ation was change d , I as k the for n t desk of C on t i ent al A ir line and they told me that this f light was c ance ll ed because the bad we a ther on the no r th part of the A m er ic a and So I have to stay in a hotel on one night in H ust on .
However , when I took a p h on e call to the hotel to as k the room , the s ta f f told me that there was no more sp a ce in this hotel , So I have to go to C on t i ent al A ir line s er v ic e c ent er to told them to change the hotel because this hotel was full , then they help me to con ta c ted another hotel which has a room for r ent to me .
F in ally I ar ri v ed the hotel to took a n a p and p re p ar e the f light next day .
A t 5 : 3 0 on mar 2 7 , I c aught the S h ut t le B us between the hotel and the a ir p or t . A t 7 : 2 0 I board ed the p la ne that was de st in ed for P en s a c o la and 2 hour s la ter I ar ri v ed s a f e ly .
In conc l us ion , this is my first time to tra ve l a b ro ad on U .
My d aught er ' s front up p er too th has become l o o se the se days .
While we were wait ing for the too th coming out , I found some of the too th had turn ed v i o le t d ur ing dinner yesterday .
The middle of the back had turn ed re d .
I was w or ri ed about it and called the d ent is t this morning .
The d ent is t told me that it ' s no pro ble m , even if a l o o se b a b y too th turn s v i o le t or re d , but he ' s not sure if it ' s fine unless he look s at it .
Then I made an a p po in t ment for her .
It ' s qu ar ter to six to day .
Yes ter day , I ra n a mar a th on , 4 2 . 1 9 5 k m .
It was too hot to run a long dis t ance , or even to do any other ex er c is e out d o or s .
I po ur ed water over my head s ever al time s , too .
I ra n in the sha d e as much as possible to mi n im i z e the ex po s ur e to direct s un light .
It was very t ough , but I did it .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to see ing it .
To day , I dr e w a picture for my friend ' s b and .
The picture , a man stand ing by the sea as the s un sh in es down on him , will be print ed on T - shirt s .
I only know the b and from the we b .
I ' ve never me e t them in person .
But , next month I ' m going to see them for the first time .
I ho pe they will like the se T - shirt s .
I started to walk every day .
I want run in s te ad , but it ' s too hard for me .
This p ar k is pretty big , with many f l ow er ga r d en s in it .
No w , the ra pe b l o s s o m s and a certain kind of ch er ry b l o s s o m s are at their
But my f o ot and back hu r t .
O h my go d , tomorrow is M on day again and we have to hand in our week en d home w or k , but there are so much home w or k to do .
I ha te re pe at ed ly re w ri ting the English sen t ence s that I w ro te in c or re c t ly .
It does n ' t have any effect on my English le ar n ing !
What I need to do is just c or re c t it once and re m e m b er them so that I w o n ' t make the same mistake s again .
O h I re ally do n ' t know what the teachers are think ing .
M a y b e you mean ' W ish me l u c k . . . '
I at ten d ed a C h ri st m as part y at ch ur ch last S at ur day that was he l d for work ing people .
They had many simple game s .
There were 4 people and 3 cha ir s .
One of the girl s , who is my friend , p ul led out the cha ir another girl was try ing to sit on and she f e ll on her back s id e !
It was un b el i e v able for me because I ' ve done the same thing when I was a ch il d and my teacher s c o l d ed me so much .
Some people say it ' s an in ter n ation al school , and it might be . . , but in fact it ' s a l ot more than that .
It ' s a no n - pro f it or g an i z ation that b r ing s students from around the g l o b e to g e ther . S t ud ent s are se le c ted b as ed on me ri t through a to t al or part i al s ch o l ar s h i p pro g r a m , so the ability to pay is n ' t take n into account at all .
I want one of those s ch o l ar s h i p s so bad , it ' s my dr e a m to get to know more of the world , to get to know a l ot of c ul ture s , and to be able to speak for e i g n language s f l u ent ly .
And being able to le ar n all of that from people with such different back g r ound s is what make s U W C so sp e c i al to me , it ' s the per f e c t place for everything that I want to do .
I just c a n ' t im a g in e the way it would im p a c t my life , such a wonder ful ex pe ri ence .
My brother has of ten made me s ad since he finish ed his ar m y s er v ic e .
He began to s m o ke and play game s day and night in a c y b er c a f e .
B e c a us e this , my little s is ter and I had to of ten go and find him in the c y b er c a f e .
H is p h on e was always off and he did ' t go to home to sleep at night .
I re m e b er ed wait ing for him , re s ul ting in me we e p ing all night .
My p ar ent s ho p ed that he would go to C h in a to g e ther with them and that may b e th a y can change his te m p er and bad ha b it s .
But he insist s on stay ing in T a i w an and on keep ing his bad be ha v i or , ma k ing us feel pai n and help less .
To day my father on a ra re visit , came to T a i w an . I was very ha p p y .
And then my brother said that he had a t est . ( I do n ' t tru st him , he had to be going to c y b er c a f e . )
So we wait ed for him unti l 6 o ' clock , and when he did n ' t still come home and my father los t his te m p er .
( If it ' s 1 0 : 0 0 o ' clock and he still has n ' t come home , we de c id e to l ock the do or . )
A t 8 : 0 0 , when my brother came home , we were p re p ar ing to shout at him .
S ud d ent ly he said , `` I have de c id ed to go to C h in a with father , because I c a n ' t hold on t o myself `` .
We were so surprise d and began to smile .
It ' s so s ur p ri s ing that I c a n ' t believe it !
I always re ally worry about him .
A l th ough t I do n ' t know him going to C h in a is a good thing , that he want to change himself make s me feel ha p p y .
It ' s one of J a p an ' s H o l i day s to day .
B y the way , I like mo un tain s much more .
( as ho l i day s of course ) .
D o you know that J a p an ( being de s c ri ble d as a work a h o l ic country ) has 1 5 ho l i day s , the most out of all de ve l op ed co un t ri es ?
O f course , I did n ' t know .
I ( have ) a little free time , so I ( have re st ar ted ) us ing L an g - 8 ! !
A l ot of things have happen ed this month .
I c a n ' t de s c ri b e ( everything ) , ( co m m a ) but our family is very good now .
O ur ( re l at ive s ) do n ' t live in the To h o ku are a , ( co m m a ) but my hu s b and ' s friend ' s house was ( de st ro y ed ) by big t s un a m is .
We are always ( worry ing ) about his family .
I had a s light f ever .
W or k will like ly be hard / t ough tomorrow .
It was very hot there , and I got s un b ur n on my left ar m .
A th en s is full of people and di la p id at ed an c i ent mo n u ment s .
The tri p to A th en s did n ' t re la x me .
R es ul t of 1 7 th S ept e m b er work
To day , I thought [ about something ] very de e p ly .
What should an ar t is t be like , what should a bu s s in es man be like .
When I make a mistake , there is a bra n d im p a c t .
I receiv ed a letter from a you ng girl from the U .
I am interest ed in you , I will like if you e m a il me back at my ( f a v o ur b ar k an i @ y a h o o .
u k ) because I will like to s c an my p h ot o so you will understand me well .
H a w a i i V o l . 2
To day , I will write about my tri p again .
There was a v i v id ma g ent a B o u g a in v il le a near the Ka il u a be a ch p ar k .
I or d er ed a de l ic i ous f r u it s al ad .
This be a ch is very f a m ous for the sea t ur t le s that come to s un b at he there .
A t that time , there were no sea t ur t le s on the be a ch , in s te ad there was a H a w a i i an mo n k sea l .
He was big and was just sleep ing on the be a ch .
I think that all bu s s y s te m s in the world has th e ir a d v ant age s and dis ad v ant age s .
I have l ot s of home w or k .
So I ' m going to go to the l i b r ar y to do it . . . . .
In s te ad of not do ing it , I got great me m or ies ! !
To day , I went to a d ent is t .
because I had a too th a ch e last night -
it is very pai n ful , I do n ' t want to go to the d ent is t .
but I have to go tomorrow again for my te e th ri d g e .
I do n ' t know why I have a c a v ity da k ne un d e , I b r us h my te e th da i ly .
The b a b y has ar ri v ed !
The year 2 0 1 1 has started with the ar ri v al of a new b a b y in my family .
H is old er brother , P a x , like s to take care of him .
It ' s l o ve ly to see the old er try ing to hold the little one and to he ar what he say s to the b a b y .
P e op le say that the old er one of ten get s j e al ous of the new c ome r and act s n as ty , or be ha ve s like a b a b y .
But I can see now that P a x some time s p re ten d s to be a small b a b y - he some time s want s to fee d / n ur se from my b re a st and he c r a w l s .
I look for w ar d to see ing how they their re l ation s h i p as brother s de ve l op s .
I ho pe they can be the be st of friend s with each other .
I ' m start ing to le ar n English
I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent .
( look s like a f en c ing ) I started it as an e le ment ar y st ud ent .
So I ' ve been play ing K en d o for a long time .
L a st year I went to To ul ous e , F r ance for one month .
That was a very good place ! !
It was very funny , because the first time I tri ed to speak F re n ch I could n ' t co m m un ic ate with people well .
So after f e w days , I started always us ing English .
I ' m interest ed in the c ul ture s of va ri ous co un t ri es .
I want to talk with people from different co un t ri es .
The Project M an age r should have a set of s k i ll s or te ch n i qu es , includ ing the a b il it ies to raise the sh ar p question s , de te c t the un k n ow n as s um p tion s , and so l ve the con f l ic t s between people , e t c .
A l s o includ ing many s k i ll s in mo d er n man age ment as well .
The ma j or respon s i b il ity of the Project M an age r is to id ent if y different ri s k s that affect the success of the Project , which should be me as ur ed by for m al or in f or m al way s through o ut the who le pro j e c t .
R is k always g en er ate s from the un c er tain ty of the pro j e c t .
A success ful pro j e c t man age r of ten take s the ri s k of pay ing to much at ten tion to the matter .
I agree with such a opinion as a qu al if i ed pro j e c t man age r come s not only from study ing , but more from p r a c t ic ing . .
I will go on a school tri p to H o k k a id o from S ept e m b er 1 5 th to the 1 8 th .
I have never been to H o k k a id o so I ' m look ing for w ar d to going .
In fact , I hard ly know anything about them .
So I c a n ' t do n ' t tea ch you anything .
But I will tell you about it when I return from my school tri p .
I first read the J a p an e se ver s ion when I was 6 or 7 year s old .
This is the second b ook in the s er ies `` My F a ther ' s D r a g on `` as you know .
The English is easy but it make s me clear ly im a g in e each scene .
The r h y th m of the sen t ence s make it easy to read .
This story begin s with a scene in which a dr a g on was s a v ed and f le w away from an is l and where f er o c i ous an im al s had l ock ed him up .
9 - year old E l m er s a v ed the dr a g on .
Then they were on their way home .
F ir st they came a cross T an g er in a I s l and with many ta ng er in es .
A fter s u f f er ing a st or m , they f le w down to a little gr e en is l and .
There they me t some can ar ies who se k ing was sick from c ur i o s ity .
This is the end of the first part .
I will write about the f in al part tomorrow .
B e c a us e , I ( study ) with my friend K , about op t im is t ic train ing for sp e c i al education ( ed u c at ed ) ch il d re n .
I want ed to study this long time a g o .
So , I felt ( feel ) that to day is a day which my dr e a m s come s tru e !
So , I felt sat is f i ed
it turn ed s un n y
To m or r ow I m go n n a take the S S A T .
wish me l u c k l u c k & p l z cross ur f ing er s ( every on e on L an g - 8 ) for me !
C ur r ent ly , I of ten watch English mo v ies in or d er to p r a c t ic e English .
My favor ite mo v ies are as follow s :
- B a c k to the F u ture
- K i k i ' s D el ive ry S er v ic e
- The H o l i day
I like S F , ro m ance , and a ction ( mo v ies ) .
The mo v ies I like have a gentle , fine feel .
O r also please let me know a wonder ful mo v i e in difficult English .
E ver y time he came to our house before , he brought us something n ic e and ex ot ic from C h in a - however , he had ra n out of so u ve n ir s that he had brought from home that particular night .
So he hand ed to each of my d aught er s a p la st ic c age in which a little c re a ture was ma k ing ra t t ling no is es on the pe b ble s .
I l o v ed an im al s but I had never f an c i ed re p t il es that much .
So as to be polite , I s up ri s ing ly told our gue st a w h ite lie - commen ting that the t ur t le s he brought were a b s o l ut e ly a ad or able .
Y e ar s pass ed , and they gr e w as time f le w by .
I once brought them to a ve t when they got sick . They s u f f er ed s y m p t o m s like having no a p pe t ite and s w o ll en eyes . The treat ment was two sh ot s and it co st me 2 0 0 do ll ar s .
No w , I l o ve them so much !
It ' s so funny in an ir on ical way that l o ve see m s to appear out of no where .
It ' s p ur e e m o tion to w ar d s the se t ur t le s .
My d aught er has name d the t ur t le s M a i - cha n and C h i b i - cha n , but I ' m act u ally se c re t ly call ing them J ul i a and R o b er t .
I ' m very ex cited for find ing this sit e .
I ' m le ar n ing English and want to im p ro ve it .
I did n ' t know there was a us e ful we b s ite like this .
pro g r a m m ing is very difficult
to day , I start to study pro g r a m m ing .
but I did n ' t understand p h p ( ? ) .
it is very difficult .
I ' m writing a di ar y ent ry in English for the first time .
It ' s tra ve l to a for e i g n country with my father .
When I was a ch il d , I pro m is ed my father that I would become able to speak English and to take him to a for e i g n country .
So , I will study English and take him to a for e i g n country .
On mo n day morning if you have b re a k f a st in an It al i an b ar you ' ll he ar commen t s about the re s ul t s of S un day ' s f o ot b a ll ma t ch es .
In the It al i an ch amp ion s h i p there are 2 0 tea m s ( in P re m i er L e a gue ) ; the tea m s with the be st play er s are : J u v ent us , In ter , M il an and R ome .
E ver y S un day the tea m s begin play ing at 3 o ' clock p . m . , the ma t ch last s 9 0 minute s .
So on after the game s end , sp or t s pro g r a m s a ir on t v ti ll 7 p .
There are l in k - up s with sp or t s j o ur n al is t in each st ad i um , in ter v i e w s with the co a ch es or play er s and im age s of s ever al go al s , corner k ic k s , free k ic k s , p en al ty k ic k s , ex p ul s ion s , w ar n ing s and f a il ed go al s .
A fter p ri m e time , other sp or t s pro g r a m s start again for those who did n ' t stay at home in the after no on watch ing the te le v is ion .
On M on day morning after `` a day `` te le v is ion commen t ar ies there are also those of the f an s !
Why did I p ic k that ?
A c t u ally I do not re m e m b er why I ch o se the p h r a se .
I would be able to call myself a `` no m ad . ``
B e c a us e I have been un able to stay in one place for more than 3 month s .
B e c a us e of that ex pe ri ence , I could do job s with va ri ous s k i ll s .
I do not know how long my s ch ed ul e to stay here is .
A l th ough many people living in this a c c o m m o d ation are get ting w or ri ed
I can ex pe ri ence di ver se life s ty le s with this time in A ust r al i a .
A t least , I will ex a c t ly p r ed ic t that I think I ' ll get good ex pe ri ence in A ust r al i a
if I return to So u th K or e a .
D id you he ar the new s that an A m er ic an guy w on a $ 2 3 2 mi ll ion j a c k po t ?
I c a n ' t even im a g in e such an am o un t !
He ' s a re ally l u c k y guy !
I wish I were him .
But I worry a little that this much money will dr ive him c r a z y or r u in his life .
The ma s s me d i a re p or t s on him ex ce s s ive ly .
I know this is just to get view er s ' at ten tion , me includ ed .
I think they should re f le c t on their sen s ation - see k ing nature .
I ho pe the people s ur r ound ing him leave him alone a little .
when I draw a de e p b re a th I feel better .
but I feel l on le y .
I b ro ke up with my bo y f ri en d f e w week s a g o .
I c a n ' t even see him because he live s in another country .
and also , I b ro ke off re l ation s h i p with a friend .
she was my be st friend .
but she made me feel bad , I do n ' t w an n a get in to u ch with her any m or e .
It ' s re ally a hard time for me .
however I feel re l i e f .
I ' m try ing to get a job .
I ' m go n n a make money and then I ' ll go to tra ve l alone .
ch in a , ti b e t , ne p al , In d i a , and T ha il and !
I f a il ed to get a job f e w time s , but It ' s O k .
I keep try ing .
I ho pe I make new good friend s ! !
I have a too th a ch e to day .
I ' m wonder ing whether I should go to a d ent al c l in ic or not .
This is my favor ite sub j e c t , and it is so interest ing !
The picture you can see in my pro f i le the pack age of a j i g s a w p u z z le .
I thought I could finish it in a week or so ,
but it ' s very very difficult ! ! ! ! ! !
M o st of the piece s are re d , so all the piece s look a like .
F or your i nformation , I have n ' t finish ed it yet .
My ho b b ies are s k i ing and j ud o .
I have s k i ed since I became a j un i or high school st ud ent .
But the co st is in c r ed i ble high ! !
On the other hand , j ud o is a reason able sp or t .
I have a black be l t .
But re c ent ly , the day does n ' t ex is t for me because I stay a w a ke all night long and then s l ept unti l the mo on
is sh in ing right a b o ve my head .
it is kind of we ir d that no matter how hard I try , it ' s get ting w or se and
It ' s already e i g h t in the morning and no need to say , I my eyes are still open even
though it is b re a k f a st time !
I will c re e p into my be d in a f e w minute .
Why did I ch o o se to day education as a sub j e c t ?
M a y b e because as a father who se ch il d is finish ing kind er g ar ten I ' m conc er n ed about what my da u g ther is going to be t aught in the follow ing year s .
And because I re al i z e , now that it has become my pro ble m , that now a day s education in school s need s to face s ever al cha ll e ng es to be us e ful for ch il d re n and for so c i e ty .
O f course I ' m not an ex p er t , and without do u b t I ' ll be in a c c ur ate and sub j e t ive , but I ' m going to talk about how I per c i e ve the sit u ation .
F ir st of all I think we must face the fact that the pro ble m s are not going to be so l v ed by cha ng ing the c ur ri c ul um if we do n ' t help teachers to a d a p t themselves to it .
We ' re going to take a t ent , a sleep ing b a g , and so on with us so that we can sleep in the t ent on the mo un tain .
It ' s my first time stay ing in a t ent on a mo un tain , so it sound s re ally ex c it ing .
It has an o b el is k at it s pe a k .
I ho pe that I can c ar ry all that he a v y stuff and still enjoy c l im b ing .
I l o ve tra ve ling and I had never tra ve led by myself before . I felt it was time 4 me to s l i p away to get some fresh a ir outside in A p ri l .
I sure ly know that it is ir re s p on s i ble to dis a p pe ar without saying good b y e to da d & mo m .
what ' s more , I de f in ite ly knew that I would hu r t them , s c ar e them and make them worry about me .
but , at that moment , I just want ed to take my ti c ke t , sea r ch ing some place s to c al m down and re le a se str es s .
L i j i an g , a place where I could te m p or ar i ly for g e t the p re s s ur e , s l ow down the p a ce and enjoy myself l o un g ing around and tak ing p ic s free ly and co m f or t ably .
the old town re ally ga ve me a sh ot 2 p ur if y and b ro ad en my mind .
I made friend s with strange r s and now I still keep in to u ch with them .
some time s I ' d l u v 2 re v i e w them , re m in d ing me of those face s , the s m e ll of s un s h in e and my f o ot p r in t s d ur ing the tri p .
I ' ve been le ar n ing English in school for three year s .
T h re e year s a g o I was le ar n ing G er man , which I st ud i ed for six year s !
And I was the be st in the class , but now I ' ve for g ot ten everything . I w an n a le ar n F in n ish too , but it ' s very difficult .
I ' m interest ed in other c ul ture s , es pe c i ally J a p an ( and other s As i an co un t ri es too ) , so if you ' re J a p an e se , S ing a po re an , K or e an , or other As i an , just write to me .
And I go to the B ad in h square to see the n ation al f la g ri se .
But many people go there e ar l i er to ex er c is e .
A fter the d y s a c ous i a w h is t le , the n ation al an th e m is s un g strong ly
E ver y body has a de c ent and di g n if i ed stand and re m a in s il ent through the so ng .
when the f la g is on the to p of the f la g to w er is the right time to finish the an th e m .
I ' m re ally ex cited right now ! ! !
A c t u ally my bo y f ri en d can c or re c t my es s a y s but I do n ' t want to as k him . . . because it ' s a little b it e m b ar r as s ing .
So I ' m us ing this sit e to im p ro ve my English s k i ll s .
I think I ' ll write a b l o g ent ry from time to time .
And I ' m going to po st a T O E F L writing es s a y as well : )
I am e m b ar r as ed to say that I am not good at English but l o ve to le ar n it .
Besides that if you want to le ar n J a p an e se , I would ha p p y to help you ,
Well , let me c ut my re d un d ant in t ro d u ction here and make some commen t s on l ate st new s which dr e w my at ten tion .
A ccord ing to J a p an e se T V new s , some 46 0 0 0 people return to J a p an after sp en d ing their go l d en week ho l i day in a for e i g n country .
D u e to th re at of s w in e f l u , many people includ ing n ur se s and a ir p or t s ta f f c he c k tra ve l er s .
I saw one of those tra ve l er s return ing from me x ic o comp la in ed of the has s le at the a ir p or t .
but he should n ' t have go ne if he did n ' t want to comp la in .
R e m e m b er that go ver ment w ar n ed against all no n - es s ent i al tra ve l in a d v ance and there are some people work ing on this case now in s te ad of sp en d ing va c ation .
C ha ng ing My M in d
We f in ally de c id ed on when we ' re going to mo ve .
We will mo ve to another place on three con se c ut ive h o l i day s : the 2 1 st , 2 2 n d & n b s p ; and 2 3 r d of No ve m b er .
There f or e , I must pack all the st u f f in my house alone in twenty days .
It sound s re ally t ough and hard & n b s p ; for me . . . . . .
I gue s s that my d aught er will some time s will help me but I do n ' t expect it .
In addition , if some on e help s me , I will get con f us ed about the con t ent s of the b o x es which I do n ' t pack by myself .
There f or e , I want to pack them alone .
I ' m sure that I must pack over 2 0 0 bo x es .
O h my go s h ! ! ! !
As we p re p ar e to mo ve , I will th r ow away all un ne ce s s ar y things .
I know that there are a bu n ch of bo x es which I have n ' t open ed yet which I will after I mo v ed here .
While I ' ve live d here , I b ough t a l ot of things .
I re g re t the money I was ted to bu y un ne ce s s ar y things .
A re you a person who can th r ow away un ne ce s s ar y things ?
In my case I ' m s ting y and I c a n ' t bo l d ly th r ow things & n b s p ; away .
And I ' ve kept a l ot of c ar d b o ar d bo x es which have not been open ed yet
I will th r ow away all those bo x es this time .
I want to change my mind and be a better house man age r .
My home is very old . It was con st r u c ted more than thirty five year s a g o .
However , I like my home because it is very at t r a c t ive !
One of the reason s is because of how kind the re s id ent s are .
Some time s they s c o l d him , but it is always tender ly because of his in no c ence .
So I feel that many re s id ent s watch out for my so n , and I ' m re ally than k ful .
However I have to mo ve in a f e w week s !
The new home is not so far from here and it has a more mo d er n de c or .
However , I have a con f id ence that I will mi s s my present sweet old home in the near ly future .
I mo v ed into B ur w o o d , l o c at ed in the we s ter n sub ur b of S y d ne y .
There are many C h in e se in the c ity .
I have been to some other sub ur b s such as S il ver w at er , and S t r a th f i el d . I do have not have any i nformation about them .
However , it was more pe a ce ful .
I entered here as short - ter m stay . It is similar to being a back p a c k er , so I had to bu y my own f o o d .
L u c k i ly , it was near to W o o l w or th from my a c c o m m o d ation , so it was easy to bu y f o o d .
As a re s ul t , I became a c ity person .
When I live d in So u th K or e a , I live d in the country s id e .
It would take long time to a d a p t myself to this new life .
I feel good now because the at m o s p he re is s il ent
I dr an k too much and now I have a head a ch e .
But I had such a great night because I enjoy ed eat ing It al i an f o o d and dr in k ing .
I expect ed to be ha m m er ed .
I ' ve never had a head a ch e while dr in k ing .
I ' m kind of sh ock ed because I believe myself to be a poor dr in k er .
I ' m a b s o l ut e ly in d is c ri m in ate when it come s to m us ic and I can listen to everything from p op to class ical m us ic .
I just laugh and tea se her that she is like a man .
I went with her , but just to ha ng out in M o s c ow ( I only like M e ta ll ic a with the s y m p h on y or ch est r a and some b al la d s as well ) .
This sp r ing she is going to go to He l s in k i , F in l and to see I ro n M a id en and she c a n ' t wait !
My first di ar y ent ry in English
My o c c up ation is a de s i g n er who make s a pro m o tion al mo v i e in a certain game comp an y .
I like read ing ( for e i g n no ve l s in particular ) , co ll e c ting f i g ur in es and s ur f ing the in ter ne t .
I ' ll write about those things in the di ar y .
F ir st time coming here
There was a ty p h o on last night .
But to day , is very funny .
I could see M t .
It has a l ot of s n ow , and it look very beautiful .
I mean I de c id ed to us e the pai d study ha ll that my you ng er brother go es to .
A t first , I could n ' t access the in ter ne t . by w i re less L A N at the study ha ll .
But I have been able to access it the in ter ne t since I had comp la in ed to a janitor . of the study ha ll about that .
He re it is quiet and co m f or t able for study ing and work ing .
I can put as id e every te m p t ation s and b re a k away from the c r ow d when ever I am here .
I am now able to understand that why my brother go es there every day .
B y the way , I think the janitor of the study ha ll have has nothing to do all the time .
I en v y him , I want to run a study ha ll one day .
W h i ch one is c or re c t ?
which sen t ence is c or re c t ?
I w o ke up e ar ly in the morning to day .
A co o l w in d / b re e z e was blow ing through the w in d ow .
H as a ut um n come ?
I was b or n in a ut um n , so I like this sea s on .
It ex is t s for a ut um n .
When I asked a question about the or i g in of the id i o m `` co l d t ur ke y `` ,
So he go o g led it , and then answered the question .
If more English teachers had their class es on line ,
it would become e as i er for English le ar n er s to take them .
I think it is a simple idea ,
My p l an is : When I po st a new ent ry on my b l o g in C h in e se .
Then I will also po st a new ent ry on L an g - 8 in English ,
B o th of them will have the same con t ent .
L a st F ri day , there was an A th l etic F est i v al at my old est d aught er ' s e le ment ar y school .
She enjoy ed it and show ed me an ex ce ll ent scene in her f o ot - ra ce .
She was always in the last position out of the three me m b er s .
B o th bo y s and girl s in gr o up s of three part ic i p at ed in the re la y ra ce .
She said that she was always last .
He r mother told her never to give up !
In this ra ce , she did n ' t get first place , but she still felt that she had w on .
She ga ve us her be st smile at the end of the day .
On S at ur day , I went to a works h op about her b s .
A c t u ally a close friend is Y o g a teacher .
She is interest ed in all as pe c t s of he al th y living , includ ing ma c ro b i ot ic f o o d .
, her b s , A y ur v ed a and so on .
In f l u ence d by her , I have become interest ed in my own body and mind too .
The works h op ' s teacher came to my friend ' s st ud i o from the next p re f e c ture !
She came to here by c ar , b r ing ing l ot s of her b s and some too l s .
She is like a s un f l ow er and has a very natural at t it ud e and po s it ive p ow er .
I like d her im m ed i ate ly .
To day is over , I will tell you about the de ta il s of the works h op in my next j o ur n al .
Yes ter day I play ed f o ot b a ll ( so c c er ) with my friend s .
We play ed from 1 0 : 0 0 a m to 1 2 : 0 0 p m .
But it was an a w ful ly hot day in O k a y a m a J a p an yesterday .
One of my friend s felt un c o m f or t able , and he v o m it ed .
We b a k ed in the b la z ing s un .
My s k in is still b ur n ing .
E ver y time when I see J im P ar s on s or even he ar his name , I c a n ' t help but b ur st into laugh ter .
He is a very p op ul ar come d i an and play s the ro le of She l d on C o op er in The B i g B an g The or y .
I like watch ing his show for two reason s .
The first reason is see ing his funny f a c i al express ion s , his mo ve ment s , it is a re ally re la x ing .
What ever the mo o d you are in he can make you laugh .
J ust like un c le M c D on al d who is just try ing to make you ha p p y .
The second is that all his line s are well written , not just something you for g e t after the show .
He put s his de e p thought s into a hu m or ous way of express ion , so you can always find something new and re fresh ing , you re m e m b er his ma g ic smile on the T V .
This is why J im P ar s on s always make s me laugh .
I just came back home now , I ' m tired to day . . .
I had an English class e ar ly in the morning , and then I had a part time job as a T e a ch ing As s is t ant .
It was a s un n y morning but s ud d en ly it began to ra in when I was T A ( it ' s an out d o or class ) , we got we t because of the ra in . . .
A fter that , I did my re se ar ch for my m aster ' s the s is unti l . . . . . .
That ' s all the things I did to day . . .
T ri p to see the ch er ry b l o s s o m s .
We made a g i p b a p for a l un ch p ic n ic .
A n y way , since morning , the we a ther was already very dark and ch il ly .
Then , we wonder ed whether bu d s will come into f l ow er .
U n f or t un ate ly , it did not .
To see full b l o o m s of ch er ry b l o s s o m s in S e o ul , we may have to wait unti l this week en d .
F in ally , I know that the le ve l of my English s k i ll s are the w or st .
But I ' m ha p p y because I got to know L an g - 8 and so many teachers ( = my new friend s )
I will think of English as f un and not study ing . .
Some time s I ' m so bu s y with work ,
but I will try to keep p r a c t ic ing .
T h an k you for all of your help again . .
I not ic ed a r ul e that she see m s to have about hu g g ing ; when I ' m hu g g ing her b a b y s is ter , H ar u - cha n , she never as k s me to hu g .
L an g - 8 is very bu s y to day .
They tri ed to find the in s p ir ation for their work from their f a m il i ar s ur r ound ing s .
F or ex amp le , C l u ad e M on e t was the pai n ter most at t r a c ted by the change of light and co l o ur .
He dr e w the same scene s in di f f er ing light ing .
But R en o ir and D e g as had a s light ly different prefer ence when ch o o s ing sub j e c t s .
They enjoy ed pai n ting the people of the world .
He es pe c i ally dr e w his friend s and f a m il ies a l ot .
my ( or the ) L a st entrance ex a m was not so co o l
I took an English ex a m last S un day .
L a st time I took the ex a m was about one and a half year s a g o .
B y tak ing same ex a m again , I found out that my English read ing s k i ll s have go ne down . . .
It see m s I los t the sen se of read ing English .
I had the ch ance to speak English with my friend s .
But I never act u ally read any b ook s or w ro te sen t ence s in English .
So it is understand able why my English went down . . .
In or d er to take back my English s k i ll s ,

E ver y s um m er , a F ri en ch st ud ent stay s in S h i k i , where I live .
L a st year my family was a ho st family for a st ud ent that stay ed for two week s .
We had re ally good time with him , so I want ed to invite him back this year , but my mother said no because she knew she would be bu s y this s um m er .
I was sorry that we would n ' t be ho st ing a st ud ent , so I want ed to help in some way and I asked if I could help .
I expect ed some work , but she said the number of students was small er than usual this year , so they did n ' t need help .
That was a dis a p po in t ment for me because I had been e age r to me e t and talk with the new students .
I was by myself because no other gue st s were in the re st a ur ant .
A fter I ed it ed my first
di ar y , I was glad to get help from friend s who come from other co un t ri es .
There were de a th s , which is s ad .
R e c ent ly e ar th qu a ke s have cause d da m age s world w id e .
It all make s me think that the end of our age is / may be near .
The most de v a st at ing e ar th qu a ke was in 1 9 8 5 ( 8 . 1 R i ch ter ) , with about 1 0 0 0 0 c as u al t ies .
The G o ver n ment hi d i nformation because they did n ' t want people to re al i z e the ma g n it ud e of the even t .
The G o ver n ment also did it because they were to b l ame for most of the de a th s cause d by the bad p l an n ing of bu il d ing s .
This year , I have w it ness ed three or four t re m or s - I c a n ' t re m e m e b er how many , my head is full .
They were of high ma g n it ud e , between 5 . 5 and 7 in the R i ch ter S c al e .
I am w or ri ed that there will probab ly be a big e ar th qu a ke in M e x ic o which will de st ro y the c ity ( M e x ic o C ity ) .
The c ity is bu il t over a la ke s y s te m , so the bu il d ing s w o n ' t be able to with st and the p re s s ur e .
U p unti l what age do people re st ar t their live s ?
I saw a question on a J a p an e se we b s ite .
`` U p unti l what age do people re st ar t their live s ? ``
F or in st ance , if you re al i z ed your o c c up ation was not s u it able for you , what would you do ?
If you are you ng , it ' s probab ly not so difficult to go back to school and try to become what ever you want .
I found many answer s that re c k on ed it was around the age 3 0 .
I was so s ad to see this answer .
3 0 is still kind of you ng .
I gue s s it may va ry depend ing on the country the respon d ent live d in .
What do you think , can an old man re st ar t their life f il led with ho pe ?
If so , what age is the limit ?
S in ce I already have a dr ive r ' s l ic en se in J a p an , I felt a p p ly ing for dr ive r ' s l ic en se here should n ' t be so difficult .
Even so , regard less of dr ive r ' s l ic en se st at us over se as , every on e need s to take a paper t est and a behind - the - w he el t est again , so I took a t est at the D M V .
A t first , I went to the near est D M V , but they turn ed down my a p p l ic ation for dr ive r ' s l ic en se t est , since my v is a st at us was still in an ex ten s ion p ha se .
A p ar t from that , since I also heard some bad r um or s re la ted to that D M V , I went to th e second near est one from my a p ar t ment .
In the second one , they accept ed my a p p l ic ation .
I thought , may b e I should have come here in the first place .
B e c a us e some r ul es are different from J a p an , such as , it ' s le g al to turn right on a re d light here , so I st ud i ed and p re p ar ed well for both of t est s .
He was strong b al d guy with s un g la s se s and never change d his f a c i al express ion or smile d .
He re m in d ed me of the T er m in at or - I ho p ed he would have said `` No pro ble m `` .
When I was there , I was very surprise d at many sp e c i al pro d u c t s . I c a n ' t believe they can make it . I think they sp ent much time and money to make the se hard work .
I am a de s i g n er , too . A t the begin n ing , I c a n ' t do those pro d u c t s . But I will make more effort , I believe I can do it in the future .
I was very tired to day , because I began work ing in the office after a 9 - day ho l i day .
F or the who le ho l i day , I sat up too l ate and got up too l ate .
So I must read j ust to my old s ch ed ul e .
B y the way , in J a p an , old people like to work without any sp e c if ic reason .
It ' s ra in y to day .
I at e in st ant noodle s because I did n ' t want to go out to bu y l un ch .
I can bu y some f o o d from them .
But it ' s con ve n i ent es pe c i ally d ur ing ra in y days .
So it became r ust y . F ur ther m or e it ' s le a k ing water .
And I r u b b ed off the r ust with s and paper .
I and four S p an ish girl s went to H y d e p ar k for a p ic n ic .
One S p an ish girl is le aving for L on d on next week so I made S us h i for her .
She said she like d my S us h i .
We had some stuff s , dr an k too much and s m o ke .
We enjoy ed to day .
My listen ing ra ng e is w il d f ro m p op , ra p , r ock , to J a z z and class ic .
T h an k s to the in ter ne t .
D u e to the a b un d ant kind s , I will in t ro d u ce them in the

F ir st one is J a y ch o u , I will say J a y is the p op k ing in As i a now .
He almost comp o se s each so ng by himself in his al b um s and write s m us ic for a bu n ch of As i a ' s s ing er s .
H is m us ic always get s good prais e and great s el ling re c or d s .
the second one is J o l in , M o st of her m us ic style is close to the f a st dance m us ic .
That one b r ing s people j o y and good spirit g en re .
What is the be st , almost her p u b l ish ed al b um s will c re ate a new dance style and le ad to the fashion among the you ng people .
I will in t ro d u ce the re st of the ar t is t s next time .
I did n ' t know about this b and unti l about 1 month a g o .
My girl f ri en d re c o m m en d ed that I listen this b and ' s so ng s , and then I came to be into them .
The ir sound , voice s and ly ri c s are so good .
He re are two so ng s from that al b um .
G o l d en We e k
S t ud ent s , and other s as well , are very ha p p y because they have a l ot of free time for play and going around to the place s they want ed to go .
Even though many were ha p p y there are also those who were not , and that was me .
My f i el d of work does n ' t have the se p ri v i le g es .
teachers ' day
K or e a has many sp e c i al days in M a y .
To day is teachers ' day .
it f a ll s on M a y 1 5 th .
students no m ally bu y [ C R O S S O U T ] con ation s [ / C R O S S O U T c ar n ation s and g if t s and
visit their teachers .
I also visit ed my ma th p rofessor and p h il o s op h y p rofessor .
They both we l c ome d me ,
P le a se listen to my in t ro d u ction ! !
My name is Y u k i .
I ' m n in e te en year s old . ( 1 9 )
I ' m a second year co ll e g e st ud ent .
I have been a me m b er of so f t ten n is c l u b for six year s .
O f course , I like so f t ten n is the most .
But , I like v o l ly b a ll , b as ke t b a ll and so on .
I of ten see J a p an e se mo v ies .
I do n ' t watch for e i g n mo v ies at all .
My dr e a m is to work in tra ve l comp an y .
F ir st of all , I want to study about J a p an e se to ur is t at t r a ction s .
T h an k you for read ing .
I have n ' t felt well since yesterday .
So I stay ed in be d all day .
I think I ' ve c aught a co l d .
I have been very bu s y l ate ly .
I have a K or e an friend .
He speak s J a p an e se very well .
I think he is very c ut e ^ ^
But he is you ng er than me . . .
And I thought K or e an me n did n ' t cha t .
I am interest ed in K or e an .
O h , I have a run n y no se . . .
I c ook ed st ir - f ri ed ve g e t able s with ch ic k en to day .
I gr il led the / some ch ic k en and sea s on ed it with sweet s a ke .
Then , I st ir - f ri ed it with some ve g e t able s .
I am very ha p p y when I can c ook well .
Let me in t ro d u ce myself . .
He ll o . my name is M ash a I am 1 8 year s old .
I ' m bu s y because I have to finish s ever al re p or t s and a mi d ter m re p or t for my the s is .
P l us , I have ex a m s . . .
I ' m p r a c t ic ally d y ing . . .
But after the se bu s y days are over , I have two month s of S p r ing va c ation ! !
I will work at school , but most of the time I will be free .
I am p l an n ing to tra ve l , sh op , read what ever b ook I want , watch mo v ies , and see my friend s .
B y ch ance I was b or n as a J a p an e se woman . . .
people can go a b ro ad or co m m un ic ate on the in ter ne t more easily than ever .
However , as every on e know s , there still are so many people who are in ex t re m e po ver ty . . .
In other w or d s , only a small per c ent age of people can own person al comp ut er s and co m m un ic ate with people all over the world .
And act u ally , this fact is quite strange for me . . .
The di f f er ence between ri ch and poor is b as ed most ly just on which country they were b or n in !
I was b or n as a J a p an e se , but if I had been b or n in a poor n ation , my life would have change d comp le te ly .
But I know there is no `` if `` in hu man life , we c a n ' t do anything but live our own live s . . .
As some on e said , `` D o n ' t think too much about things that c a n ' t be change d . ``
O h I just c a n ' t help but f a ll in l o ve with this f ant a st ic world .
I live on a small is l and country and it see m s not too many people sha re my ent h us i as m about star t re k stuff .
The l ate st S t ar T re k mo v i e is about c a p tain K ir k and S p ock .
But it ' s to t ally w or th it . . . . .
The c ity I live in has a w ar m c l im ate .
But the se days the we a ther is get ting co l d ra p id ly .
M an y people prefer being w ar m rather than co l d and I consider myself the most re s o l ut e one among them .
In the se co l d days , I just want to stay at home : home and dr y , is there anything better than that ?
U n f or t un ate ly , I c aught a co l d last night .
He ad a ch e , no se c l o g g ed and c ough , I ha te them ! ! ! !
M a y b e I will be he al ed after a s w e at y dr e a m . ( re c o ver )
To day , I went s w im m ing and at e ic e c re a m after work .
I s w a m too hard / too much so I was ex ha ust ed .
It ' s quite funny .
This me n k o c ar d ' H ar m of B u il d ing ' is as s um ed to have been print ed in the 1 93 0 ' s .
I can dis ting u ish the print ed er a by the qu al ity of the paper , print ing and them es .
F ir st , it ' s very di f f ic ut to find me n k o c ar d s print ed in m ul t i - co l or in the 1 9 2 0 ' s or e ar l i er .
S e c on d , this could n ' t be in e ar ly 1 94 0 ' s because them es that have nothing to do with the mi l it ar y could n ' t be all ow ed d ur ing W W I I .
This could n ' t be in the la ter 1 94 0 ' s because the qu al ity of the paper and print ing of this me n k o c ar d is too good for that er a .
T h ir d , are there po s s i b il it ies that it was print ed in the 1 9 5 0 ' s or la ter ?
B u il d ing s were not an ic on at that time .
B o y s l o ve something sp e c i al in all of the time s .
So , I con l ud ed this me n k o ' H ar m of B u il d ing ' was print ed in the 1 93 0 ' s .
In the se days , kid s c a n ' t have the se kind of ' d y st op i a ' to y s .
That ' s the reason why I l o ve me n k o !
It was a ra in y day .
We sh ar ed an um b re ll a .
We had la un ch at a f a m ous re st a ur ant .
This re st a ur ant is f a m ous for `` hand m ad e k n if e - c ut noodle s `` which con tain short - ne c k ed c la m s and a va ri e ty of ve g e t able s .
It ex h i b it ed a l ot of re l ic s and i nformation about se o ul history .
A r ound even ing time , we went to the ' S h in ch on ' .
' S h in ch on ' is know n as the `` street of you th `` .
There are many you th ful people .
We were one of them .
We had dinner .
We at e f o o d made from f l o ur .
A fter we were full we took a walk .
I am in L o s A ng el es .
No w , it is 7 : 37 am .
G o o d morning every body !
No w , there are many c ar s on the free way of L o s A ng el es .
I will go to S an F r an c is c o to day .
The a th l etic meeting at my so n ' s kid er g ar ten is going to be he l d next week .
He did n ' t take part in the even t because of the in f l u en z a dis e a se last year .
To day , I me t a for e i g n gue st , he always go to sh op p ing at morning !
So I very in qu is it ive to as k to him , are you a st ud ent ?
He said he is n ' t .
He came here for L e ar n ing bo x ing .
That ' s so co o l ! ! bo x ing ! !
It does not mean s I dis like them , I ' m just not interest ed in the con t ent s they talk about .
H ence , I feel b or ed , when I ha ng out with them .
I enjoy ed the time when I was in the English con ver s ation c l u b .
It not only im p ro ve s my speak ing , but also help s me a b s or b s some c ul ture about the United States .
A ll of them require a great de al of time .
L on g time no see .
I did n ' t po st any j o ur n al last se m est er .
My s um m er ho l i day will end next M on day , so I need to go back to school .
( I was very dis a p po in ted that my last di ar y had no commen t s .
There f or e for the time being , I would like to keep my p r a c t ic e to an e ng l ish di ar y . )
To day , I would like to talk about my a ng er to my man age r in work place .
I work for an ex p or t and im p or t comp an y , and I have been work ing in an office for 3 year s .
And he has been work ing there around 1 3 y e ar s .
O ur comp an y us ed to have me m b er s of 9 people , but now we con s is t of only 3 me m b er s
I was not ic ing my man age r ' s st up id ity and he give s me a le c ture and say s that I c a n ' t be such a st up id person when I am a sen i or in the future .
And I thought we could n ' t see his ability before d u e since it had been co ver ed up to other people .
He like s to sh if t his work respon s i b il ity to some on e else .
He c a n ' t de c id e anything and he always need s to make the way of his es c a pe from any sit u ation .
He always p re ten d s that I know everything .
He us ed to speak ne g at ive ly even when we were talk ing about j o ke s .
I am not great but his at t it ud e is dis g ust ting to work with . I just need to talk to e a se the str es s .
Some on e told me that it will help to have good e ng l ish speak ing s k i ll s when you fight some on e .
C on g r at ul ation s on You r G r ad u ation !
I change d my c l o th es to at ten d the ( more sp e c if ic ) ce re m on y .
On my way to school , the ra in change d into dr i v ing s n ow .
A ll gradua te s entered the high school as se m b ly ha ll and they sat down in their sea t s .
The most impress ive thing was that girl ' s gradua te ' s me s s age to all students .
The gradua te ' s p ar ent s were listen ing to her story with tea r s in their eyes .
She said she had be l on g ed to a v o ll e y b a ll c l u b .
F in ally , they could take part in the v o ll e y b a ll game s and they ex pe ri ence d v ic t or ies and de f e at s .
I believe it ' s ex pe ri ence was a great t re as ur e and she ' ll never for g e t her wonder ful me m or y for the re st of her life .
My d aught er also had great t re as ur es and me m or ies .
S t ar t L an g - 8
N ic e to me e t you !
I ' m going to study in a language school in U , S , A .
P le a se tea ch me !
A n In d i a v is a
To day I a p p l i ed to the con s ul ate for a v is a for In d i a .
I have been in C ha ng ch un for s ever al days .
I saw a b r ow n a d ul t s n a ke which had di ed be s id e a big b an an a f i el d .
D ad told me it was not po is on ous because it s head was n ' t tri an g le - sha p ed .
That re m in d ed me when of when I was a kid . . .
It has been a long time since I first saw a s n a ke .
I still re m e m b er when I was a e le ment ar y st ud ent , I saw a de ad U m b re ll a s n a ke [ B un g ar us m ul t ic in c t us , ( B ly th ) ] .
That ' s the first time I was so close to a po is on ous s n a ke , al th ough it had already di ed .
My da d also told me l ot s of his ex pe ri ence s with s n a ke s .
When he was a kid , he us ed to catch s n a ke s re g ul ar ly .
If the s n a ke was po is on ous , he would hi t unti l it was de ad and play with it for f un .
O r he might catch a no n - po is on ous s n a ke , k i ll it and eat it .
He said he brought a no n - po is on ous s n a ke to school , the s n a ke is re ally big . He was c aught by his teacher , which re s ul ted in him being s ever e ly be a ten by his teacher .
I asked him why he did that ,
and he said , when he was a kid he was never afraid , and did everything for f un .
But , he is a man now , and he would never do those things again .
I gue s s that ' s because I le ar n ed one thing from this ex pe ri ence :
When people gr ow up , they gradua l ly for g e t their in st in c t s , or they become afraid of try ing new things .
R a in y S e as on .
R a in y sea s on has finish ed yesterday in J a p an .
I of ten us ed mo ter c y c le , but the r a in has p re v ent me to ri d e .
My English s k i ll s are poor , so who ever con ta c t s me if you could please help me with my English , that ' d be great ! ( ^ _ ^ ) /
One of my favor ite an im es is `` D e t ro it M e t al C ity ``
D e t ro it M e t al C ity ( D M C ) is story about a m us ic i an , N e g ish i .
But after all , he ' s s ing ing in de a th me t al b and , D e t ro it M e t al C ity .
He always comp la in s about his b and and he is always try ing to qu it it , but he is the per f e c t de a th me t al s ing er on st age .
D M C also has w il d f an s .
U s u ally he is a re ally kind and n a ive guy , but when he is in D M C , he is e v il .
This ga p make s this an im e funny .
It ' s F ri day night now in J a p an !
I want ed to go out for dr in k some where , but I am still in my house .
I will watch `` 2 0 1 2 `` on D V D for now .
This di ar y is being written for the first time .
I think that I will become a c c ust ome d to English on this sit e because it is not good at English either .
I will work hard so that the translation machi ne is not us ed as much as possible .
P le a se c he c k if the se sen t ence s are c or re c t .
She is a little short .
So her friend s call her ' b a b y ~ ! '
She has big eyes , dark co l or ha ir and a s k in n y body .
I wait ed for her outside of her class so
we could me t after her class was over .
We talk ed to each other while sit ting on a be n ch near her class .
A fter a little while , we went to her dormitory .
I could make more friend s because many of her friend s were there also .
A fter we got to her room I help ed her study K or e an .
But it is hard to explain her question s because I c a n ' t speak English very well .
Besides her question were so difficult to explain in English .
Then , we went to the b a se ment .
S ur p ri s ing ly , there was a b i ll i ar d t able , some comp ut er s , so f as , a T V and some ex er c is e machi ne s .
The more time we sp ent to g e ther , the close r we became .
We made a p l an to go to H an - R ive r next T u e se day .
S n ow and ch er ry b l o s s o m s
We had a little s n ow e ar ly this morning .
There were a f e w ch er ry b l o s s o m s still on the tree s .
My hu s b and want ed to take some picture s of the s n ow and ch er ry b l o s s o m s to g e ther .
T h o se picture s would have been very beautiful .
But the Ya h o o in ter ne t s er v ic e p re v ent ed him from re al i z ing this go al .
The s er v ic e was n ' t work ing when he went to us e his P C .
So , he had to re st or e it im m ed i ate ly .
U n f or t un ate ly , the s n ow me l ted before he finish ed .
I s el d o m bu y J a p an e se p op m us ic C D s .
The A ut um n To m or r ow . . .
I like the a ut um n sea s on .
But I like s um m er more . . .
I want 9 0 more days of the s un . . .
I ' d l o ve to play p i an o and tru m pe t , but I ' ve had no time to play them re c ent ly .
I want to im p ro ve my English .
B e c as u e I want to co m m un ic ate with a l ot of for e i g n er s .
C o m m un ic ation among the different c ul ture s and co un t ri es is interest ing .
So , we can get more idea s , i nformation , know led g e , and so on .
F ro m now on , I ho pe I will im p ro ve with you .
I ' m not a history bu f f , so I did n ' t know about the black S ept e m b er or those ter ro ri s m s .
In addition , I have no idea about J e w s or such kind of ra c is m either .
I wish I would have had more know led g e , and it made me be interest ed in those is s u es .
In the M id d le E a st and e a st E ur o pe , the se e th n ic pro ble m s are still there , are n ' t they ?
I must do a l ot of home w or k s and re p or t s !
W at ch ing T V or D V D s ,
However , what I must do will make me very ha p p y in the future .
If I can do it , I can feel a sen se of a c c o m p l ish ment .
M o st people want to a v o id things they have to do ,
If I can finish it , I can have a better time to do what I do n ' t have to do ( I w an n a do ) than not finish ing it .
I will thought of pro c ed ur e for my a ction pro f ound ly !
To day is We d ne s day ; N e w Y e ar draw ing near . This year , N e w Y e ar and V al ent in e ' s D a y are on the same day .
My co ll e a gue will tra ve l by p la ne to night : how ha p p y ! I also want to tra ve l , but I do n ' t speak English and I have no money . O h go d , why are there so many language s in the world ? Why do n ' t we all us e the same language ?
I also like B e i j ing G u o ' an and D ar k o M at ic .
I have four so c c er s c ar ve s : B e i j ing G u o ' an F C , M an ch est er United , B ir m ing ha m F C and B e i j ing B a x i F C .
But I los t my M an ch est er United s c ar ve s in T i an j in ! ! ! ! !
The character s ' person al ity is from ( depend s on ) their n ation al ity and c ust o m s .
The people from strong co un t ri es are usual ly a man or p ow er ful woman .
L i ke in W W 1 , E ng l and was the e ne m y of every country .
The en m ity from op i um pro ble m s with C h in a ; the de ta ch ment with A m er ic a ; always fight ing with F r ance since the begin n ing . . .
It ' s very interest ing and it make s you understand the history and g e o g r a p h y of the world , p l us a l ot of other different things in different co un t ri es .
I l o ve A P H ! And T a i w an has a c ut e girl .
If you have see n this co m ic , you can talk with me about it .
but I can not speak a for e i g n language very well .
If I can speak English , K or e an and C h in e se , I will have a l ot of friend s .
U n t il last week en d , one of the previous ten ant s had live d with me , but my friend mo v ed into the house last S un day ! !
A c t u ally , she has to go back to J a p an at the end of A u g ust , but I want to ha ng out with her a l ot unti l then .
L a st week en d was bu s y .
I need ed to go sh op p ing , do l and ry , and visit my friend .
I think it was better than what I ' d had in J a p an !
She ga ve me some a d v ic e .
If I re ally In or d er to do what I want , I should study much hard er than now .
M a y b e it is very hard to a c c o m p l ish it .
However , she said I might be able to do it , so I should tru st in myself and just do everything I can ! ! !
A re you f a m il i ar with Ka r a o ke ?
Ka r a o ke is the place where b y we can s ing a so ng .
But k ar a o ke has some mean ing s .
It ' s too difficult for me to explain here .
In Ka r a o ke there are many small bo x - ty pe part i tion ed room s .
We can s ing in the room .
I like to s ing with my friend s .
However , I ' m not good at s ing ing .
M an y J a p an e se people like it .
I r re s pe c t ive of age , from you ng to old , a l ot of people go to Ka r a o ke .
There are many Ka r a o ke sh op s in my c ity .
Ka r a o ke machi ne s will gra d e the so ng for a person s an g .
I want to s ing very well .
D o you like to s ing ?
I s there any Ka r a o ke sh op in your country ?
One of my a im s of study ing English is to have a good gra s p of English po etic express ion s .
B y the way , I like T an i k a w a S h un ta ro in J a p an e se po e t ry .
( I know there already is a good translation but I will make a translation myself . )
I ' ve been le ar n ing hu la for ten month s , al th ough I ' ve never been to H a w a i i .
When I at ten d ed the first less on , I found it was very t ough . . .
B e c a us e I had to stay in a half - c ro u ch ing position most of the time .
A n y way , I ' ve been a d d ic ted to it ever since and I ' ve been p r a c t ic ing very hard for the success of the ro ll o ut because it will be he l d on A u g ust 3 1 2 0 0 8 .
However , while I was sit ting up l ate , I at e too much ( again ) .
( I at e two c up s of ri ce and two piece s of to a st with ch o c o l ate s .
And I dr an k a c a f e a u la it . ) And I at e too much for l un ch to day . . .
I went to a ra m en sh op with my friend , who is 2 year s old er than me .
And , in J a p an , old er friend s of ten pay for both me al s .
The noodle s ( alone ) we i g h ed 3 5 0 g .
It was pretty y um m y any way .
So my st o m a ch has been k il led a co up le of time s the past 2 days .
P er ha p s you are look ing for t al ent ed J a p an e se ar ch ite c t s with over three year s ex pe ri ence in ar ch ite c ture school .
I am p ur s u ing ur b an re ne w al te ch n i qu es and l and s c a pe ar ch ite c ture s , and I have a ke en interest in al g or i th m ic de s i g n .
My intention and ex pe ri ence provide d me with a b ro ad and un i qu e v is ion for the new ar ch ite c t ur al f i el d in C h in a .
I gradua ted from Tokyo U n ive r s ity of the A r t s with Bachelor de g re e in ar ch ite c ture and I am p ur s u ing a M aster de g re e now .
I po s se s s a strong s k i ll of v is u al express ion .
In 2 0 0 7 , I had the op p or t un ity to work full - time in the office of P rofessor A k ir a K ur y u ( C h i b a U n ive r s ity . ) for one year .
This ex pe ri ence provide d me with va l u able s k i ll s of the g en er al bu il d ing de s i g n pro ce s se s .
A d d i tion ally , in the J un A o k i office , I op er at ed R h in o ce ro s and was in v o l v ed in different pro j e c t s such as as se m b ling natural co ll age s , and op er at ing 3 D f un d a ment al for m s on C A D so f t w ar e .
I have both te ch n ical know led g e and a good found ation of s k i ll s to quick ly a d a p t to new te ch no l o g ies .
F or in st ance , since I was f a m il i ar with the us age of machi ne ry , I t aught my co ll e a gue s how to us e it .
F ro m the se work ex pe ri ence s , I re al i z ed f un d a ment al s k i ll s and good tea m w or k are im p or t ant fact or s in the success of ar ch ite c ture pro j e c t s , which help ed me a l ot for the next job in this f i el d .
I have strong co m m un ic ation s k i ll s to co ll a b or ate with tea m s and I am also con f id ent in my s k i ll s .
My ability to de l i b er ate so l u tion s for pro ble m s has all ow ed me to con s is t ent ly a ch i e ve go al s .
F or in st ance , at the P rofessor K ur y u ' s office , when we de s i g n ed the public ha ll , we work ed with the go ver n ment to find out the opinion of l o c al re s id ent s .
I an a ly s ed the se opinion s and in te g r at ed them in my propos al of the f in al re p or t .
This was agree d upon by all me m b er s and we could a c c o m p l ish this pro j e c t by follow ing my propos al .
I am certain that my ex pe ri ence s and a b il it ies , which are l is ted in my we b p age , would con t ri b ut e to your pro j e c t s .
This week en d , I will go to N i i g at a for the F U J I R O C K F E S T I V A L 2 0 1 0 .
I asked my friend to day if it is possible I will get a good mar k on my English speak ing ex a m in ation . I act u ally like to speak in English very much .
However , she was very serious when she told to me I will never get one of the be st mar k s , because I make so many mistake s d ur ing English con ver s ation s .
Then I had to as k for myself whether it is a good thing to be honest at all , because her honest answer hu r t me so much .
I know that ly ing is not a good thing . However , some time s we need to tell a ' w h ite lie ' , which is mean t to co m f or t some body else .
B e ing honest is very difficult as well , but she felt con f id ent to tell me , because she has re al conc er n for my well - being .
I am very gr ate ful that she respon d ed honest ly . No w I can view my pro ble m more object ive ly .
I am writing a di ar y for the first time .
I have been study ing English because I want to speak with many different people .
My friend s told me this sit e is good : )
There are s ever al reason s why read ing b ook s is good .
There are al ot of i nformation we can get from b ook s .
F or ex amp le , s c i ence , litera ture , g l o b al , language , and so on .
In addition , you can b ro ad en your per s pe c t ive .
The more you read b ook s , the more your co m m un ic ation s k i ll s can im p ro ve . .
I do n ' t have a reason for do ing so . . .
D o you have a face b ook account ?
In fact , I got my face b ook account a while a g o .
I think I ' m go n n a up d ate my face b ook p age .
( To day , I up l o ad ed M t .
If you are interest ed in it , I will let you access and accept your friend request : )
and I easily catch co l d s .
What I was surprise d about is that the direct or s of the dr a m a are ga y even though it ' s ma in character s are all w ome n act ing as house w ive s .
I thought it was made by f e m al e direct or s , but any way it ' s a w es ome .
consider ing the st or ies and mo o d of de s p er ate house w ive s , the dr a m a is f it to w ome n .
I ' d like to us e better express ion s and c or re c t w or d s .
To day , I w an n a talk about study ing for e i g n language s .
S t ud ent s in public school s have st ud i ed English since 7 th gra d e in J a p an .
( But my K or e an is not good , I ' m st i ll a begin n er le ve l . )
M o st J a p an e se co ll e g es let their students study any for e i g n language ex c ept English .
We have to take other language class es . )
I want ed to study K or e an at my co ll e g e . But un f or t un ate ly , my co ll e g e does n ' t off er K or e an class es , so I took F re n ch .
A c t u ally , I do n ' t like to study F re n ch because I ' m not very interest ed in F r ance to begin with . I took it against my will because I had to ch o o se one my co ll e g e off er ed .
I ' m not f l u ent in any language s , but I ' m interest ed in other language s
H a ve you ever had this feel ing too ? ( sound s more natural )
My mo m said it ' s not good for me , and she suggest ed that I should study other language s before I m aster one .
I indeed agree with my mo m , but how do I de al with my de s ir es ?
What do you think about this is s u e ?
If you are o k a y with it , please answer my question s .
P ro b ably , most J a p an e se students are t aught that some time s `` were `` is us ed for the sub j un c t ive mo o d .
If I were ri ch , I could bu y what ever I want ed .
However my teacher told me that most A m er ic an s do n ' t us e it .
I think that all language s are change able every minute but I ' m con f us ed .
D o you us e `` were `` for the sub j un c t ive mo o d ?
I ha te ex a m in ation s .
When I was a ch il d , I was very good at it .
But I can not do it now .
A fter school , ch il d re n p r a c t ic e it every day .
They are very good .
I should give myself more str e ng th .
He ll o , I ' m a new me m b er on la ng 8 .
I want to study English so I want to make friend s with every on e .
To day I went to the e y e c l in ic for a c he c k up
Yes ter day , I had an op er ation because of my short s i g h ted eyes .
My qu al ity of v is ion has in c re as ed from 0 . 1 to 2 . 0 - it ' s in c r ed i ble !
The view from the train was very clear , just like p h ot o g r a p h take n by a di g it al came r a .
I was surprise d by the re c ent im p ro ve ment s in me d ical te ch no l o g y .
G o o d b y e my g la s se s , than k s for all the se year s .
I want ed to watch a f un f ant as y like `` H ar ry P ot ter `` yesterday but in s te ad I watch ed a dark f ant as y with a he a v y them e .
The mo v i e I watch ed to day was re ally good .
It had a l ot of e le ment s like a d ve n ture , th ri ll s , c ut e c re a ture s , and so on .
I thought the t w in s were play ed by two person s .
They were comp le te ly different character s .
I would like to in t ro d u ce myself .
I watch ed some mo v ies .
To day was a ho l i day .
So , I went to the mo v i e the at er to watch some mo v ies .
I watch ed two mo v ies ; because , to day is first day that we can watch mo v ies for only 1 0 0 0 yen .
We usual ly have to pay about 2 0 0 0 yen .
I watch ed the J a p an e se mo v ies `` My Darling is a F or e i g n er ' ' and `` No d ame can t ar b i re . ' ' T h o se mo v ies were funny and impress ive .
`` No d ame can ta b i re ' ' is one of my favor ite mo v ies .
It ' s them e is m us ic
and set ting is in P ar is .
I re c o m m en d it .
I think all of you have already heard of the B r a z il i an C ar n i v al .
This high ly ant ic i p at ed ho l i day , ce le b r at ed for four days in F e b r u ar y , invite s people through o ut the n ation to ce le b r ate a ccord ing to their l o c al c ul ture .
They are or g an i z ed ar t is t ic gr o up s that p re p ar e perform ance s to be present ed in great p ar ad es . A t the p ar ad es B r a z il i an s , as well as , to ur is t s de light in the me s m er i z ing dance and m us ic .
What ever you ch o o se , C ar n i v al is a time to re ch ar g e your b at ter ies in or d er to face the year a head .
I s it possible to understand other people ' s pai n ?
I think we can im a g in e other people ' s pai n because of our past ex pe ri ence s .
F or ex amp le , we know that it ' s pai n ful when a b a ll hi t s to my body quick ly .
B e c a us e we le ar n that by ex pe ri en c ing that .
So when a b a ll hi t s other people ' s body , I can im a g in e that it is pai n ful .
But I can only im a g in e that .
A b a ll did n ' t hi t my body .
A b a ll hi t ting other people ' s body is not my ex pe ri ence .
So I c a n ' t understand .
How do you answer this question ?
The ga r b age was co ll e c ted this morning .
I feel ho pe less ! ! ! !
It ' s been a week now , no one , no one , is will ing to c or re c t my es s a y , I ' m so s ad .
When I got to my class bu il d ing , one of my be st friend s in A m er ic a was c ry ing .
I asked what ' s wrong with her , and then she told me that she just got a te x t from her mo m saying that her gr and m a pass ed away .
I did n ' t know what was I suppose d to say to her .
I did n ' t come up with any w or d s that could make her feel better .
A fter the class was over , I got a call from my J a p an e se friend .
He r bo y friend who she started da ting only 3 days a g o d um p ed her .
P ro b ably saying nothing and listen ing to her talk was the be st way to make her feel better .
It is some time s re ally hard for me to think of what I should say when my friend s are having a hard time .
Then I also looked up ' mi d d ling ' and could n ' t re ally see a di f f er ence between the two de f in i tion s
I was laugh ed class ma te . My class m ate laugh ed at me
But I de c id ed to act rather than keep con f us ing myself .
To day I went sh op p ing with my mother and brother .
My mother had come back after some month s . She works in another c ity and visit s us once every two or three month s .
It is w in ter here , and my brother did n ' t take his co at because that morning it was s un n y .
He should have take n his co at .
It ' s took place one day d ur ing my ch il d h o o d .
When I was a st ud ent in middle school , T h ough I had see n my friend ' s father once in the bu s , but I could n ' t re c o g n i z e him .
So I did n ' t b ow to him .
A f e w days la ter my friend who is a d aught er of the man that I saw in the bu s asked me why I did n ' t b ow to her father ?
I was wonder ing I said `` I ' ve never see n your father `` .
`` My father said he saw you in the bu s on that day . `` she re p l i ed
I wish for your at ten tion ~
She sen t me a te x t to say that she would be l ate .
S in ce I have to make some pro g re s s in my English writing s k i ll s .
Yes ter day , I b ough t a new j a c ke t on line .
It was quite c he a p .
So , I w or ri ed about the qu al ity unti l it was de l ive r ed this morning .
It ' s c l o ud y in S a p po ro , it see m s it will begin to ra in .
It ' s some h ow no st al g ic .
When some on e say s to you `` N ic e to see you again , `` what do you re p ly ?
I am a un ive r s ity st ud ent .
My age is 1 9 .
I want to speak English , because my dr e a m is to work in a for e i g n country .
P le a se help me with my English .
G ive me your a d v ic e .
My big g est pro ble m with co ll e g e is that I get ex ha ust ed because I have a l ot of things to do .
With this kind of life style , my f at i gue a c c um ul ate s day by day .
In conc l us ion , I will take a re st d ur ing my s um m er va c ation , and re c o ver my v i g or .
I usual ly us e ex ce l at work ,
but my ex ce l le ve l is very poor too . . .
I have tri ed to write about sp or t s , my family , and mo v ies .
I have no idea what to write about the se to p ic s .
However , I have to sub m it it in this even ing .
I think what I write about ( the to p ic s ) is not good . My le c ture r said it was r u b b ish .
What should I do to write well ?
I ' m a bo y , I ' m 2 1 , and I ' m from C h in a .
I want to make some friend s with this !
It has been about 4 month s since my last c he c k up .
The d ent is t told me that I do n ' t have any c a v it ies as yet .
I some time s for g e t or f a il to b r us h my te e th , but for t un ate ly I have had no c a v it ies since I began going there and I get my t ar t ar re m o v ed on a re g ul ar b as is .
The d ent is t and as s is t ant s always man age t o find a way to re la x ch il d re n .
F or ex amp le , they put a T V in front of the p at i ent ' s cha ir and play the D V D of ' To m & J er ry ' while the ch il d is ( being ) ex a m in ed .
I ' m afraid that the p ar ent s con f us e To m ' s sh ri e k with their ch il d ' s . l o l !
I heard an am b ul ance s ir en , but the s ir en stop p ed soon .
I went outside and saw the am b ul ance stop p ed at the con d o m in i um near here .
A fter a while , ( may b e in 2 0 minute s ) , I went outside again and not ic ed the am b ul ance was still there .
L e ar n ing a for e i g n language is one of the most difficult yet most re w ar d ing ex pe ri ence s of my life .
So since I entered un ive r s ity , I have always been listen ing to re al English voice s to im p ro ve it .
The P e ng u in s of M ad a g as c ar is my favor ite c ar t o on , and I le ar n ed a l ot from it .
my ta s k at work was finish ed this year and so I c le an ed up around
I was so tired .
I was do ing some w ed d ing - re la ted work s ut er day .
There were 5 different co up le s get ting mar ri ed .
I took some me d ic in e and s l ept e ar ly .
Then , yesterday I went to S h i g a to help out with a ch or al so c i e ty ' s re g ul ar conc er t .
I felt a little ten se when I read the con g r at ul at or y me s se g e .
since I was bu s y 2 days , I went to a `` sen t o `` ( P u b l ic bath ) to day !
I feel so re la x ed .
I think `` sen t o `` is a n ic e part of J a p an e se c ul ture .
I return ed to my home .
I went to T ha il and 6 days a g o and I ar ri v ed in So u th K or e a yesterday .
When I ar ri v ed in T ha il and , I could not b re a th because the te m p er a ture was over 4 0 C , but I had a p re c i ous time in T ha il and .
I could feel that T ha i people are very kind and have a po s it ive mind .
There were s ever al beautiful place s and many de l ic i ous f o o d s , which were very e c on o m ical .
Some time s I got into a ' T u k T u k ' , which is a T ha i tra n s p or t ation .
It sh ook he a v i ly , but it was very f un . The T ha i ' s M c D on al d ma s c ot had a different po se from other co un t ri es .
I had a great time in T ha il and and I will never for g e t my tri p .
I at ta ch ed the p h ot o s of T ha il and , which were take n by my f il m came r a ( K on ic a p op ) .
D o you believe in re in c ar n ation ?
She is one person who believe s in re in c ar n ation .
It was a w h ite do g , and my mother l o v ed it so much .
However , when it was 8 year s old , it got sick .
She was w or ri ed about it and took care of it a l ot , but it di ed .
O f course , all of us felt s ad and c ri ed , because we l o v ed it so much .
My mother es pe c i ally felt so s ad that she said to the do g ' s de ad body `` If you will be able to be re b or n , you should be a hu man ' s b a b y next time . ``
A fter 2 0 year s la ter , I ga ve b ir th . my d aught er and my mother was very glad about that .
And she asked my d aught er , `` D o you re m e m b er this ? ``
When I looked at it , I was so sh ock ed because it was the b ow l which our do g had us ed before .
O f course , my d aught er was up se t , and could n ' t understand what she mean t .
There f or e she started to explain about the b ow l `` It was the b ow l which you us ed when were my do g . I have want ed to me e t you as a hu man being for a long time .
D o n ' t you re m e m b er that b ow l ? ``
My d aught er answered `` I do n ' t re m e m b er well .
When she heard my d aught er ' s answer , she seemed to be dis a p po in ted .
When I was in O k in a w a , I could see the c l o ud s different ly .
They looked like they were raise d in the s k y .
The sp ar se ly raise d c l o ud s in the s k y amp l if i ed the un c an n y at m o s p he re with t w in k ling star s .
It see m s to me that nature there was different from that of big c it ies such as Tokyo .
There f or e our eyes were natural ly r ive ted on it s in d i g en ous nature .
Even after so a k ing in the sea , the s un b e a m pro m p t ly e v a p or at ed the water from our so g g y c l o th es .
And it s original c ul ture en ri ch es ha r m on y between hu man and nature .
O k in a w a has some re m o te is le s around it .
And I found myself look ing at a c ar ri age to w ed by a water bu f f al o at one of the is le s .
A man on the c ar ri age was play ing m us ic un i qu e to O k in a w a , which is co m m on ly s un g in O k in a w a so ng s .
I have just made m y mind to part ic i p ate in in ter n ation al ex change .
I know my spoke n e ng l ish is not well , so that ' s why I ' m here : ) It will be great to find some body who know s e ng l ish very well and want s to le ar n r us s i an .
F or ex amp le , the number of the he in ous c ri m es like ho m ic id es has been in c re as ing , and it ' s been get ting / becom ing more difficult to get a job re c ent ly .
No t to me n tion , the e c on o m ic c ri s is is still con t in u ing , which has led to many b an k r up t c ies .
There are even s ever al case s of a b us e by a p ar ent .
One of the reason s is the fact that more mother s need to go to work now than before . S e e not e .
In the future , I ' m sure hu man re l ation s will be we a k er than they are now .
A g i g ant ic e ar th qu a ke str u c k To h o ku dis t ri c t in J a p an yesterday .
I did n ' t feel it at where I ' m living .
A t first , I could n ' t believe what I was see ing on T V .
The t s un a m i was s w e e p ing out co un t less c ar s and house s .
A l th ough I have some re l at ive s in To h o ku dis t ri c t , I c a n ' t get in to u ch with them .
M an y me m b er s of my class will turn 2 0 year s old soon .
When we become 2 0 year s old , we can dr in k al c o h o l and s m o ke in J a p an .
Some time s I ' m con f us ing and I c a n ' t man age to re p ly to question s in English .
Some time s I c a n ' t follow the question s , some time s I c a n ' t ch o o se the right w or d s .
The old m aster living in this house thought , `` B e c a us e of this s ud d en ra in , many people will come to b or r ow um b re ll as . ``
But if I l en d um b re ll as one after another , however many I may have , it w o n ' t be enough .
So you receiv e visit or s and re f us e to l en d um b re ll as to them . `` And he went into a room .
To ku s u ke , who live d in the next town , ra n in and said , `` C o ul d you please l en d an um b re ll a ? ``
Y ot ar o answered straight , `` If I l en d um b re ll as when ever I am asked , however many I may have , it w o n ' t be enough .
I w o n ' t l en d you one .
I have them on the corner of the she l f . ' U n d er st and ? ``
P le a se l en d me your c at . ``
The man was surprise d to he ar this , and went home .
A fter another short while , the m aster living on the street came in and said , `` E x c us e me .
I have things to dis c us s with your m aster . ``
I ' m so ex cited and also n er v ous to day , because this is the first time that I l o g g ed on to L an g - 8 , and that is why I ' m n er v ous . My English is not very good I c a n ' t speak with a for e i g n er and I c a n ' t even speak with my class m ate s .
The purpose of a p p ly ing for this account is because I want to im p ro ve my English and I want to make more friend s with people from all over the world .
I know there are many di f f er ence s between the e aster n and the we s ter n c ul ture . I also want to le ar n about it .
So , I ho pe you can help me , and I ' ll be very ha p p y if I can be your friend .
A h . I like hu m man b - bo x very much . If some on e who has the same ho b b y as I have , we can co m m un ic ate with each other .
I am very than k ful to L an g - 8 for g i v ing us a co m m un ic at on p l at f or m .
A re they de ad or al ive ?
O s a m a b in L ad en
I ' m tak ing night class es after work in a public school .
F or now , I en ro ll ed for the next three month s .
A fter this s es s ion , I ' ll consider whether I should keep up with the class or not .
The class is O K so far ; it ' s not difficult .
I went to a temple to day with my friend , D or a .
B o th of us got re ally bad for t un es .
A l th ough I told her `` J ust for g e t about it , it does n ' t matter `` ,
I asked about both l o ve and study ,
and the for t un e said `` D o n ' t go for w ar d . . .
That ' s re ally a w k w ar d .
I c a n ' t ha te my c ous in no matter what happen s .
A f e w month s a g o , I got an idea about how to b r ing my c ous in here .
You know , speak ing English is also im p or t ant in K or e a .
A c t u ally , we do n ' t speak English in our country .
But , when we try to get a job , we will be t est ed in English .
A n y way , when he first came here he had n ' t got his own c ar , so he us ed to b or r ow my c ar .
Some time s he want ed to dr ive my c ar when we went some where to g e ther .
He near ly k il led me three time s .
F or ex amp le , when we were on the high way , he was dr i v ing at 1 1 0 k m .
But he did n ' t watch the ro ad , as he was interest ed in some co w s which were on the side of the high way .
He cross ed the middle line .
A t that time , a c ar was coming in the op po s ite la ne .
But , he did n ' t know that unti l I s c re ame d out .
It was too da ng er ous .
There are even more st or ies I can tell .
I think I have already said too much .
We will talk about this again la ter .
O ur middle d aught er was c ry ing when we tri ed to put her in be d yesterday .
E i ther my w if e or I need to take care of our you ng est d aught er , so she some time s has to sleep alone .
While she was c ry ing , I just finish ed put ting our you ng est d aught er to be d then I took care of her .
I will present a so l u tion for a pro ble m in the te x t b ook !
However , the pro ble m is difficult for me !
R e c ent ly , I ' ve been w or ri ed a bout what I want to do in my future , so I am de p re s s ed and have been just conc ent r at ing on study ing !
My present worry is about what kind of job s are s u it able for me .
I not ic ed re c ent ly that I do n ' t like study ing alone , so being a re se ar ch er or p rofessor see m s un s u it able for me .
So I will work in a big name make r ( large comp an y ? ) and make p l an s for new pro d u c t s .
O r may b e I will work in a b an k because I have a s k i ll for ma th and could us e it .
However I have much time to make a de c is ion , so I have f o c us what I have to do now .
T im e is run n ing out !
So I will try my be st to do what I can do now !
I am a un v i er s ity st ud ent . I am 2 1 year s old . I want to p r a c t ic e my English .
So any on e who want s to le ar n C h in e se or can help me in my English may a d d I C Q number 437346934 or my M S N me r n y _ ting @ hot m a il . co m . T h an k s ~
A l m o st all P e op le said `` It ' s very us e ful and ex qu is ite ! ``
So I will ex er t effort in or d er to understand it .
My f a se b ook j o ur ne y start s to day .
I ' ll be a co ll e g e st ud ent after this s um m er ho l i day , which make me ex cited , full of p ri d e and ho pe ful / ho pe .
C o ll e g e life is also p re p ar ation for future care er s .
A l th ough there are people who at ten d co ll e g e just to ful f i ll their p ar ent s ' wish and get the di p l o m a , I think that was ting time in co ll e g e to play comp ut er and so on is not a s m ar t idea .
L e ar n ing and p r a c t ic ing the s k i ll s which we will need in the future is es s ent i al
A ll of us w an n a have a ha p p y life and a good care er with high in c ome , so most of us want to at ten d to co ll e g e to re al i z e our dr e a m .
There f or e we should gra s p every second in co ll e g e .
F ir st , I ' m sorry for my poor English .
We have been give n hu g e s up p or t by many co un t ri es .
T h an k you so much for your w ar m - heart ed ness ! !
I l o ve you , friend s ! !
F or t un ate ly I did n ' t feel the hu g e sha k ing .
K e e p going ~ ! ! ! K e e p going ~ ~ ! ! !
Where there is a will , there is a way !
F ro m now on , I ' ve de c id ed to me m or i z e some English w or d s every day .
I think that v o c a b ul ar y is the b a se of English .
I had been study ing English at school in J a p an since I was in j un i or - high school unti l now , in un ive r s ity , but I still c a n ' t speak English f l u ent ly .
It has been said that J a p an e se education ' s serious pro ble m for a long time , and it was made by English teachers .
B e c a us e most of J a p an e se school ' s English teachers c a n ' t speak English f l u ent ly , they c a n ' t tea ch English like a n at ive speak er .
O f course they have good teaching s k i ll , but I think the most im p or t ant as pe c t of English education is how to co m m un ic ate , because language is too l co m m un ic ation .
Even though J a p an e se students have been study ing English for 6 or 1 0 year s is school , they c a n ' t for m good re l ation s h i p s with for e i g n er s for the lack of speak ing s k i ll .
The J a p an e se go ver n ment has been en c o ur age d to im p ro ve English teacher ' s train ing for de c ad e .
The mi n is t ry of education have been try ing to e m p l o y for e i g n er English teachers in s te ad of J a p an e se teachers for raise a English education ' s qu al ity , other w is e it was hard ly f un ction al in J a p an .

While I was watch ing the new s piece , I not ic ed a certain thing .
I know , of course , that she was try ing to speak clear ly and s l ow ly so the a ud i ence could comp re h en d what she mean t or want ed to say . . .

I ' m very tired and sleep y c u z I only s l ept 3 h o ur s last night .
I just finish ed class and the next less on will start in 4 h o ur s .
I may sleep unti l the class start s but I have to study tra f f ic r ul es to pass the ex a m . . . . .

I want to go dr in k ing , da n c ing , play ten n is and many other things .
mo v ing is trouble s ome for me .
but it see m s f un to live in a place where I ' ve never been .
any way , I have many things I have to do .
first of all I will try to go to be d .
To day was an ex t re m e ly n ic e day .
There was s un s h in e and the we a ther was like sp r ing .
I re ally want ed to ha ng out with my friend s but I did n ' t
B e c a us e yesterday when I was play ing b a se b a ll with my b a se b a ll tea m ,
I hi t my face against the other tea m ' s play er .
I was re ally hu r t ,
and I got a black e y e .
I did n ' t want to show my face to other people .
So I was study i g English and watch ing `` L O S T `` ( A m er ic an D r a m a ) in my home .
D es p ite the fact that I did n ' t ha ng out with my friend s , I was ha p p y
I was so n er v ous from start to finish that my face was ( or became ) dr en ch ed with per s p ir ation ( I must ' ve looked u g l i er than usual . . . ) and some question s I had p re p ar ed for the in ter v i e w s l i p p ed my mind .
On my way home , I was already begin n ing to give up on the job and de c id ed to go to the E m p l o y ment S er v ic e A g en c y tomorrow .
A l th ough what I de s p er ate ly want now is a full - time job , I op ted to accept the off er right away .
A fter all , I need to make a living .
A n y way , after work ing part - time for a two month per i o d of pro b ation , the comp an y will see if I ' m s u it able for the position .
So , from now on , I have to le ar n a l ot of te ch n ical terms for c l o th ing to tra n s l ate the comp an y ' s we b sit e and do c u ment s and so for th into English .
C o ul d any body tell me any help ful we b sit es to le ar n about the se terms ?
my trouble with le ar n ing English
With my sp ar e time , I have been study ing e ng l ish at an in ter n ation al e ng l ish school since D e c , 2 0 0 7 .
but to my dis a p po in t ment , I have found that I have not made any o b v i ous pro g re s s , es pe c i ally with my listen ing and or al s k i ll s .
al th ough I can read some e ng l ish ar t ic le s and write some simple e - ma il s in e ng l ish now , it is still very difficult for me to co m m un ic ate with for e i g n er s in e ng l ish .
how c an I im p ro ve my e ng l ish listen ing le ve l in a short a m o un t of time ?
who would like to give me some us e ful a d v ic e ?
To day , when I were s ur f ing in ter ne t , I found this j o ur n al .
I am going to tra n s l ate it . ( more natural )
He gradua ted from the high school which I gradua ted from .
In the So u ther n Ka n t o , there were only two D P J state s m en who could re tain their sea t s in con st it u en c ies , Ka n N a ot o of M us ash in o C ity of Tokyo and No d a Y o s h i h i k o of F un a b ash i C ity of C h i b a .
This is the reason why he was consider ed as a new le ad er of D P J .
My near est ra il way st ation l o c at ed on the b or d er of F un a b ash i and N ar ash in o C it ies .
M an y state s man f re qu ent ly appear s there , and No d a of ten speak s to v o ter s at the st ation in the morning .
I have always v ot ed for him in e le ction s , but I know nothing about his po l ic ies , because he say s nothing about them .
He st ud i ed po l it ic s at a f a m ous un ive r s ity , so he certain ly has a l ot of po l ic ies .
However , he does n ' t show his po l ic ies clear ly to the v o ter s , because po l ic ies make e ne m ies .
He is e age r to help v o ter s , but o b v i ous ly , he does n ' t like talk about id e o l o g ical matter s .

I went to my English class .
O ur comp an y he l d a get - to g e ther to day .
We at e p or k ri b s .
They were de l ic i ous .
No w I am going to sleep .
I just j o in ed L an g - 8
I just j o in ed L an g 8 X D
I do n ' t know what to write here .
But I ' m try ing .
E ver y body , please help me .
I wish W in ter would come f aster . . ^ ^
L a st year I started le ar n ing s n ow boarding .
It was the first time in my life to go to a s k i ing gr ound .
A t first I just s k i i ed , but 2 hour s pass ed and I became un in ter est ed .
C ha ng ing to a s n ow board was re ally f ant a st ic .
T a k ing a s k i less on for 1 h o ur was o . k , but s n ow b o ar d ing was ( both ) very , very difficult and very interest ing .
F or the first time I b ough t e qu i p ment .
The we a ther has been so hot that I re ally mi s s w in ter ,
when everything become s w h ite .
It was not so co m m on here in J a p an to change job s about 2 0 year s a g o .
My first job - change was at that time .
However , to tell the tru th , I want ed an easy way to es c a pe from difficult pro ble m s .
When I had to face such pro ble m s , I strong ly felt that it was a was te of time to keep try ing .
I ' m a p t to ho pe that great re s ul t s would come .
But great a ch i e ve ment s are not ( of ten ) o b tain ed easily .
If some on e ' s success is sh in ing b ri g h t ly , I can just see it .
It sound s like a simple thing , but it ' s difficult for me .
When I think that so l v ing a difficult pro ble m will be im po s s i ble , it will probab ly turn out to be tru e .
I should qu it worry ing about whether or not I might f a il and just keep on do ing it once if I have started .
Some hold the view that it is not need ed to in c re a se teachers ' s al ar ies in or d er to im p ro ve the qu al ity of education , because they f ir m ly believe that a ma j or part of students ' education is the students themselves .
However , from my every day ex pe ri ence and o b s er v ation , I can state s ever al fact or s to de f en d the state ment that in c re as ing teachers ' s al ar ies can im p ro ve the qu al ity of education .
F ir st , a well pai d o c c up ation can at t r a c t many people to be a teacher . It follow s that many people with a do c t or ate are will ing to be a p rofessor in un ive r s it ies .
There is no do u b t that a do c t or has more so p h is t ic at ed e u c ation al s k i ll s than a gradua te since he had more st ud ies and teaching ex pe ri ence s .
F or ex amp le , my school is just an a ver age co ll e g e , but it off er s the teachers a high salary .
In this case , the teachers in c ul d ing p rofessor s and teaching as s is t ant s most ly have a do c t or ate or two .
And thus the qu al ity of education in our un ive r s ity im p ro ve sh ar p ly , as well as our good re p ut ation .
S e c on d , in c re as ing the teacher ' s salary can in s p i re them to do their be st .
It is the same as a bo s s in c re as ing an e m p l o y e e ' s salary .
The teachers are the one s that want to keep their salary in a st able st u ation , and must sat is f y their students and the de an .
The need to p re p ar e their course care ful ly and in t ro d u ce new and interest ing me th o d s to ed u c ate students .
In a w or d , in c re as ing the teachers ' s al ar ies is the be st way to im p ro ve the qu al ity of education .
B e c a us e many qu al if i ed people will want to become teachers with a high salary and in s p i re them to do their be st .
I work for a b a b y c l o th comp an y as P R .
I us ed to live in F L and L A as for e i g n st ud ent .
R e c ent ly or No w a day s , I do n ' t have ch ance to speak and write in English , so this will be good op p or t un ity to keep the s k i ll for me .
I ho pe every on e see this and c or re c t this .
M o st of J a p an e se do m est ic C o m p an ies have the five - day work w e e k s y s te m , and the ho l i day s are S at ur day and S un day .
The good point is that every where I go are not so many people .
The B ad point , However , is that I have a work on S at ur day .
M o st of my friend s have day off s on S at ur day and S un day ,
If you live in an As i an co un t ri es , it ' s e as i er to take a tri p to K or e a than those who do n ' t live in As i a .
It ' s act u ally been said that a tri p to K or e a is c he a p er than a do m est ic one .
If you only want to enjoy n ic e K or e an f o o d s , you do not ne ce s s ar i ly have to go to K or e a .
B e c a us e there ' s always been a so - called K or e an town in Tokyo ! !
I went to K or e an town and had a re ally n ic e K or e an B B Q to night with my co ll e a gue s , which re m in d ed me of visit ing K or e a about two year s a g o !
Yes ter day , I was so tired and went to be d e ar ly .
But because a friend sen t me an S M S tell ing me he was sick
I was w or ri ed about him and could not sleep well .
A h , ho pe that he will feel better soon .
Yes ter day , I read a J a p an e se co m ic b ook ( M A N G A ) called `` G A K U `` .
It ' s a story of a mo un tain re s c u e tea m me m b er name d S an po .
He is a very strong c l im b er who had c l im b ed many f a m ous mo un tain s in the world .
F ur ther m or e , he is know n for his kind ness .
S an po would never s c o l d at care less c l im b er s .
In s te ad , he would tell them `` You did your be st .
Let ' s come back to the mo un tain s again once you ' re c ur ed ! ``
I ar gue with my w if e because we have some di f f er ence s between us .
I wish I could be like him .
I ' d like to en c o ur age my students in English when they do their home w or k .
What can ( should ) I say to them ?
I would be very ha p p y if you could give me some idea s .
T h o se who do n ' t know this dis e a se may feel f ri g h ten ed just to he ar about it , but it ' s one of the s k in dis e as es that ch il d re n of ten s u f f er from .
This dis e a se cause s re d ra s he s on the hand s , feet , and mouth and even on the as s .
He got many ra s he s and has a high f ever .
No w he ' s get ting better , but I feel re ally sorry to see my so n ' s body full of the ra s he s .
I st ud i ed English about 8 year s a g o .
My f a v ar ite mo v i e is `` The de v il we ar s ( the ) P R A D A ``
To m or r ow , I ' m going to have my ha ir c ut .
I s this sen t ence c or re c t ?
The P er f or m er was R o b er t G la s p er E x pe ri ment .
They are one of the most c re at ive m us ic i an s the se days . They make original m us ic b as ed on J a z z and H i p H op .
I was re ally mo v ed by their m us ic , so I am look ing for w ar d to listen ing to their live m us ic soon again .
I le ar n ed about this we b s ite from one of my friend s ,
She us ed this to im p ro ve her j a p an e se , and also made friend s .
She told me that I can p r a c t ic e e ng l ish here
My name is U n a , I have trouble in e ng l ish , and I re ally want to im p ro ve it .
C or re c ting my poor e ng l ish will take s you l ot s time , I ho pe you do n ' t mind .
It is tru e that hu n ting w ha le s is j a p an e se tra d i tion .
B e f or e see ing this mo v i e , I would never feel like that because eat ing w ha le is j a p an e se old c ust o m and tra d i tion like f re n ch eat ra b b it s and f ro g s , es c ar g o s .
F ish er m en and their f a m il ies are than k ful for w ha le s .
And they p re y for the w ha le and they have a f est i v al for a p p re c a ite to the w ha le .
It is not easy for every on e to k i ll A N Y an im al for eat ing , they hu n t the w ha le with hard pai n for their life , that is e ar n ing money .
They co ver the b l u e sea t a b o ve the sea not to show k il ling w ha le s after the mo v i e was b ro ad c as ted because they think the scene of di e ing should not be show n like hu man being does n ' t show their face to all people when they di e .
F ish er m en do n ' t b re a k any in ter n ation al law .
What right do S e a she p ar d have to c ri t ic i z e them person ally .
They should c ri t is i z e the hu n ting to the w ha le in it s el f in right way .
They just make fish er m en a ng ry by tak ing p h ot o s and v id e o s with per s is t ence and they get the scene fish er man is ma d at them .
It is de f in ite ly un f a ir .
What do you think about hu n ting w ha le s ? ?
In J a p an , there live s quite a number of c ock ro a ch es .
They are so s c ar y that even a sight of one make s me th ri ll .
3 y e ar s a g o no less than 4 c ock ro a ch es appeared in my room at the same time .
My s k in became it ch y and turn ed re d .
The in se c t ic id e was too strong .
The things I like most
I like ri s k s and new things .
N e w things always f as c in ate me .
I think every change s have the reason s and some time s , the change s help me gr ow up ( ma ture s ) .
I like ri s k s because ri s k b r ing s out the be st in one s el f .
the life that you see is wonder ful .
This is the in ter ne t ma k ing it possible to in te g r ate hu man in te ll i g ence all over the world .
However there are 2 people , those who po st the i nformation ' s on the ne t and those who us e the i nformation on the ne t .
My s el f includ ed .
So I wonder who will give the commen t on this di ar y .
My you ng est d aught er w o ke me up and asked me to take her down to the living room this morning .
I want ed to sleep more , but I de c id ed not to go back to sleep and do some work .
There were many people there because it ' s H i g an in J a p an .
We at e a l ate l un ch at a re st a ur ant near the st ation .
As we got back home and I was ent er ing our house , my you ng est d aught er want ed to play in the ga r d en out the front .
So I we ed ed the ga r d en while she was play ing .
It was an or d in ar y day , but I still think it was a good one .
I went to the G un s and R o se s conc er t at the Tokyo D ome last night .
The sound s y s te m was me s s ed up !
P ro b ably , it was because of the are a where I was sea ted .
I gue s s the speak er s y s te m could not re a ch our are a ( very ) well .
In addition to that , it was too co l d in the ve n u e and so on . . .
A n y way , I was ha p p y to he ar f a m ous t un es from their past al b um s .
To day I j o in ed an English school .
It s the kind where students talk to a teacher living in P h il i p p in es by S k y pe p h on e ( I P te le p h on e ) .
It s co st s 5 0 0 0 yen .
It s very c he a p when comp ar ed to a normal English school .
I can he ar the teacher ' s voice clear ly , but it is difficult to understand what the teacher say s when it s only by voice .
I work ed hard without much success , because the to p ic was too difficult and compli c at ed to de s c ri b e .
The te x t b ook qu ot ed from a l ot of paper s , so I was re ally con f us ed try ing to make sen se of the out line .
I was n ' t sat is f i ed my present ation though I like dr in k ing after every effort no ne the less ^ ^
I want to do better next time .
A hu g e job hu n ting even t will be he l d this week en d at a large con ve n tion ha ll in Tokyo .
So I made re s er v ation s for an over night bu s and hotel .
I was too l ate to make re s er v ation s , so it was very difficult to find them , es pe c i ally an over night bu s .
As for a hotel , I ' ll stay at a hotel which has hot springs .
However , I can stay there at a reason able p ri ce .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to visit ing there .
I ho pe I ' ll be mo t i v at ed through this even t .
To day , I could n ' t explain a B ri t ish person why T O E I C is more f a m ous than I E L T S .
I said `` T O E I C is the ma in ex a m in ation in J a p an , so many sh op s have got a l ot of T O E I C te x t b ook , a only a f e w I E L T S . ``
I ' ve had difficult y , es pe c i ally in writing because I have n ' t receiv ed proper fee d b a c k .
I also want to help people who wish to le ar n K or e an .
He ll o ! E ver y body !
to day I w ro te an in t ro d u ction about myself ! ! !
I live in j a p an .
My job is are s id ent n ur se in a ho s p it al .
my dr e a m is to be an in ter n ation al n ur se ! so I will try my be st ! !
please help me im p ro ve my e ng l ish ! ! !
if you w an n a study j a p an e se , I can tea ch you j a p an e se ! ! !
but I c a n ' t see the sea .
I want to see the sea .
No w , J a p an is in a c ri t ical sit u ation .
I think sp il ling ra d i o a c t ive water to the sea is a c at a st ro p he .
There might be no ch o ic e about that , but I c a n ' t understand why they did it .
M a y b e if they did n ' t , the p ow er p l ant would have ex p l o d ed ? ?
What is w or se is that the J a p an e se go ver n ment is try ing to con t ro l i nformation in this in ter ne t age .
And I know many people are worry ing about it .
I re ally a p p re c i ate that .
But I re ally want to know what for e i g n people are think ing about this sit u ation in J a p an .
C h in e se is so f un .
J a p an e se also us es Ka n j i , so I think it ' s a little e as i er for J a p an e se people to re m e m b er C h in e se w or d s .
But it ' s difficult to pro no un ce and to understand .
It take s a long time for me to re m e m b er English w or d s , but I of ten already know the mean ing of a C h in e se w or d the moment I see it .
To day after my C h in e se class , my teacher asked me to come to his desk .
I thought , `` D id I do something bad . . . ? ``
But he said , `` You study so hard , but your pro n un c i ation is a little in c or re c t , so I ' ll tea ch you . ``
S ound s like you ' ve had a good time in A f ri c a ! !
I ' ll sen d you a g if t here and there if it make s you ha p p y : D
You think I ' m so kind , do n ' t you ? ! !
H o pe you ' ll have b ri ll i ant ex pe ri ence s there ! !
I find it a b it difficult to play f ut s al because a f ut s al co ur t is narrow .
That is why I have to le ar n s k i ll ful mo ve s in which I ' m second to no ne .
Let ' s play f ut s al to g e ther ! !
My 5 - month - old d aught er f in ally le ar n t to turn her s el f over to day !
She can turn on t o to her right side and lie on her t um m y , but she c a n ' t turn back the other way .
Q ing D a o - My second home
R i g h t who ga ve me a family .
M an y people like it here because of the long Y e ll ow S e a co a st line .
When s um m er come s , the te m p er a ture does not in c re a se much .
No w it is w in ter .
It is very co l d .
The w in d is very strong .
I los t my um b re ll a yesterday .
It ' s very bad new s , because I am living in a ra in y c ity .
I need a big um b er el la to a v o id get ting we t .
A fter a f e w days , I think I should go bu y a new one .
Even though I still want my other um b re ll a back . . .
My comp an y ' s c l i ent had the follow ing require ment s for the b l o g ;
To make and e m b ed a b l ur ry picture on the we b s ite .
To f o c us on some but not all part s of their ha ir s al on .
B as ic ally I always listen to all the request s from a c l i ent and try my be st to a ch i e ve the go al ex a c t ly the way the c l i ent im a g in es in her mind .
However , this time the c l i ent was very str ic t about the who le la y o ut in de ta il , because they themselves take care of their own c l i ent s ' ha ir style every day and are very sp e c if ic about the im age they are try ing to p or t r a y on their we b s ite .
It took us the e month s to comp le te it and we , our de s i g n er s , co d er s and I , have just finish ed ma k ing it . I felt a great sen se of re l i e ve when we f in ally comp le ted it !
C h er ry b l o s s o m s are s ur p ri s ing . . .
What a co l d day it is ! !
It was a very t ough game . ( what was ? )
I thought it would be w ar m enough to play ten n is without it feel ing co l d .
I went to my C h in e se students ' home to have supper .
We went to the s up er m ar ke t and b ough t some f o o d s for supper .
It was very good p r a c t ic e for me to speak in English .
The se days , I have a l ot of time to speak English .
I ch i ro A ch i e v ed 2 0 0 ( S a f e ) H it s
I ch i ro , who play s for the S e at t le M ar in er s in M a j or L e a gue , a ch i e v ed 2 0 0 s a f e hi t s for 1 0 year s straight .
It was his 1 5 2 th game , that is 1 0 days la ter than last year .
No body else has a ch i e v ed such a great re c or d .
No w , he is a star play er in the M a j or L e a gue ! !
As a J a p an e se person , I ' m pro ud of his success .
F or in st ance I did n ' t le ar n any w or d s about B a se b a ll .
Yes ter day we a ther was very n ic e , but the s un s h in e was too strong .
I t aught so c c er to kid s yesterday morning .
As a re s ul t , I got s un b ur n ed every where ex c ept for my body and le g s .
In sp ite of having got ten s un b ur n ed so bad ly , when I got up this morning , it did n ' t hu r t .
A l th ough I had go ne to be d the previous night , I was still tired .
The other at ten d e es were p rofessor s and man age r s from big comp an ies .
I want to go to an On s en if I have enough time tomorrow .
The r a in sea s on is co m m ing !
We do n ' t have a l ot of ra in in this sea s on , so the water s up p ly through o ut the c ity will start from J un e 1 2 . . .
So we c a n ' t us e water from 1 1 : 0 0 p . m . to 6 : 0 0 a . m . ! !
I do n ' t like to ri d ing my b i ke on a ra in y day , but I c a n ' t stand that I c a n ' t us e water ( ; _ ; ) So I ho pe that we will have some he a v y ra in !
I ' m so b ro ke right now . . .
So I have to find another part time job !
There ' re a l ot of things I want to do !
So I want to s a ve money !

my English is get ting w or se .
I have been study ing English all the time at the l i b r ar y .
In the even ing s ( at 6 : 3 0 P M ) , I have been going to le ar n English for a week
The name of the pro g r a m is S D A L an g u age S ch o o l .
It ' s b or ing .
But I am ma k ing the ma x im um am o un t of effort to conc ent r ate my at ten tion .
o k un i w a do ch ir a de s u k a .
j a , n i h on g o ga ha n a se m as u k a .

de m o , ch ot t o e i g o ga ha n a se m as u .

He got mar ri ed a year a g o .
O f course he in t ro d u c ed her and
We all had a long talk , you know , talk ing about the past , the present , and of course , future pro j e c t s .
G o ing back home , I thought she was the per f e c t w if e for R i ch ar d , and ho p ed that she could help him man age his ter ri ble mo o d .
E at at H ome or E at O ut ?
I think your answer is `` Yes , of course . ``
It ' s not easy to c ook e comp le x dis he s because c ook ing is a high te ch n i qu e job require s certain te ch n i qu es .
I s el d o m invite my friend s to eat at home . I am not con f id ent in my c ook ing s k i ll s , al th ough my friend s would not mind , even if I only made noodle s .
M a k ing a de l ic i ous f o o d is a difficult . You need to know what kind of ing r ed i ent s and too l s , need ed to p re p ar e the re c i pe , and you need to know how to se le c t , us e , and c ook the se ing r ed i ent s .
In C h in a , there are th ous and s of va ri ous ing r ed i ent s l and c ook ing me th o d s .
Even if the ma ter i al is the same , the ta s te may be va ri ant from different va ry by c ook ing me th o d and c he f .
F or ex amp le , fish can be c ook ed by f ry ing , s te a m ing , or s al ting , e t c .
The side - dis h could be any kind of ve g e t able s or even tra d i tion al C h in e se her b s .
So As you can see , it is not easy to c ook such n ic e dis he s at home . If you invite a friend for a me al , I suggest you go to a re st a ur ant or a ch op h ous e .
As a second consider ation op tion , most C h in e se people invite friend s to eat out when they hold ce le b r ation s , such as b ir th day part ies or re l ation s h i p bu il d ing part ies .
In the se sit u ation s , the ho st usual ly pay s the b i ll . The c ust o m is different from We s ter n c ust o m . ' .
F or this reason , do ing this would be consider ed s ting y , because you will sp en d less money , or and the next time your friend s invite you to a re st a ur ant , you will feel like you ow e them something .
F in ally , eat ing out can be consider ed con ve n i ent and s a ve s more time to cha t or do other things .
E at ing out could take less than one th ir d of the time that eat ing at home take s . That is , if tak ing it take s twenty minute s to eat at a re st a ur ant , it would take one hour at home .
E at ing out mean s there is no need to was h dis he s and c le an ing work or c le an after a me al .
E s pe c i ally when you invite a l ot of people for a me al , eat ing at home would be too much work .
It was such a hu g e so much work that I re m e m b er it even now .
No w , in my home t ow n , many such part ies would be he l d in re st a ur ant for con ve n i ence .
There are many reason s to s up p or t my view that eat ing out is better than eat ing at home , es pe c i ally when you in v it ing friend s for a me al .
It was very very de l ic i ous ! !
But I worry about put ting on we i g h t . . .
I have to go on a di e t . . .
I got my ha ir c ut at be a ut y s al on .
I like my ha ir s ty le .
H i , my first di ar y : )
H i , let me in t ro d u ce myself .
I do n ' t know what I should write in my di ar y , so I want to look back at to day .
I got up at about 8 o ' clock in the morning .
I ' ve been study ing English for a long time , but I c a n ' t speak it very well .
I s ur f ed the In ter ne t and saw a c ook ing sit e yesterday .
I found some re c i pe s and they looked so good .
One of them is l as a g n a .
I tri ed ma k ing l as a g ne for the first time and it was de l ic i ous .
I have a b re ad make r so I k ne ad past a by the machi ne .
I made a me at s a u ce and a w h ite s a u ce .
I took the p h ot o after I started eat ing .
If you find any er r or in w or d s , gra m m ar , or l o g ic , please c or re c t it .
O f course , if a st ud ent ' s ce ll p h on e r ing s d ur ing class , it both er s other students .
But it does n ' t mean that they must not b r ing ce ll p h on es to school , because if they keep them off d ur ing class , there will be no pro ble m .
My bo s s came to the comp an y to day .
U s u ally I must know before she come s or not , but to day she did not tell me or the e m p l o y e es in the office that she was coming .
I was eat ing like c r a z y . I was surprise d to see her walk by and look my way .
I must eat my f o o d quiet ly .
She told me she want ed C h in e se tea .
I must take care of my bo s s because the w if e house did not come to day .
I never re ally did that for her when I began my job .
The first time she asked me I felt very con f us ed .
In the after no on I asked her about the f o o d she want ed me to bu y , she said she can eat a who le ri ce and so up dis h .
A fter I head out , I hu r ry to bu y the f o o d for her , but I could not find the f o o d she want ed .
She laugh ed about the f o o d .
You can im a g in e if you at e the same f o o d every day you would become b or ed , I think she felt that way but she did n ' t say .
I ' m ha p p y to write in English in the same day .
T a ke care .
and after to day if must re m e m b er to not bu y ri ce with p or k for her .
He ll o , my wonder ful friend s . To day is some on es b ir th day . .
I am sorry to make her go to be d l ate , but I would like to wish her . .
`` H A P P Y B R I T H D A Y `` I would just like to say . .
we can help and str e ng th en b il at er al c ul t ur al ex change s
in im p ro ve the qu al ity and qu ant ity of our life and make a better life
I ' m visit ing this we b s ite for the first time .
So I ' ll in t ro d u ce myself .
I am J a p an e se and live in N a g o y a , which is in the middle of J a p an .
I always co m m un ic ate with T ha i and In d i an c ust ome r s by e m a il .
But I do n ' t have con f id ence to write what I think in de ta il .
So I ' ve j o in ed this we b s ite .
And does any on e who speak s English f re qu ent ly want to make friend s with me ?
It was un b el i e v able .
It was my first time watch ing a b a se b a ll game .
it ' s different than J a p an e se .
loud laugh ing , loud re g re t ting . .
any way , the r ock ies came from behind for a v ic t or y .
To ry was a very n ic e play er .
when T ro y went to the b at ter ' s bo x , every on e made some no is e .
f in ally , he hi t the s ing le hi t that made the r ock ies w in .
I will have a t est in F e b . However , I ' m in the ar m y now , so I do n ' t have enough time to study .
A ll of the people here , are you ng er than me . A fter they finish the d ut y of de p en se for our country , they will go back to the un ive r s ity and keep study ing .
However , I already gradua ted from P e k ing un ive r s ity in C h in a , so I have to find a job . I ho pe that I will be a c er t if i ed public account ant and con t in u e im p ro v ing my English and C h in e se language s k i ll s
I started it because I would like to have more op p or t un it ies to speak English , and the on line le c ture s are c he a p !
If I go to a language school and talk with a n at ive speak er , it would co st more than 3 0 0 0 0 y en ( about $ 3 5 0 ) a month , but the on line one co st s just 3 0 0 0 y en ( about $ 3 5 ) per month .
My e m p l o y ment d ur ing my ch il d h o o d .
I was o c c up i ed by many ho b b ies and am us e ment s : G re c o - R o man w re st ling ( 1 y e ar ) ; k ar ate , bo x ing , f o ot b a ll ( f e w month s ) ; and my favor ite a er o - mo d el ling ( for some year s ) - it dr o ve me c r a z y and c ur r ent ly I l o ve a ir c r a f t s & any a ir machi ne ry .
A l s o , I like my home comp ut er , was study ing how it works and other te ch no l o g y .
When I was in my gr o up of a er o - mo d el ling there was a gr o up of ra d i o l o ver s .
I never like d how they sat in their place s and so l d er ed all time .
When I gr e w up I thought about my pro f es s ion and after that I finish ed my st ud ies at the ra d i o f a c ul ty at an un ive r s ity ! ) because I had entered that f a c ul ty on free education .
C ur r ent ly I work in the ra d i o in d ust ry as a j un i or e ng in e er and I so l d er almost all day in my job .
One day she want ed to go the S e o ul train st ation .
She c aught a tax i and said to the dr ive r ,

It ' s been so long since I last spoke in English .
To day I talk ed with a guy who m I me t on L an g - 8 .
He could speak English , so our con ver s ation was he l d in English but I was re m in d ed of how my speak ing s k i ll is bad .
Some time s I am told that my written English is good . So people ten d to think my le ve l of speak ing is high , but it is de f in ite ly not .
When sit ting in front of a mi c , I c a n ' t start con ver s ation .
I s this because of my English s k i ll ? O r . . .
I can give you ter ri ble `` E ng r ish `` sound s .
I enjoy ed myself to day .
I went b ow ling with ten n is c l u b me m b er s .

A fter that , we went to G y u h an ( gr il led me at sh op ) to have dinner .

So I ten d to ch o o se s l ow b al la d so ng s .
I like this so ng because of the ti t le .
This sound s like English to me .
We never express feel ing s like this in J a p an e se .
This is a woman ' s so ng but the ly ri c s have a de e p er mean ing for me .
I want to be able to say some day , `` I have been to me . ``
It was one of the ha p p ies t days two days a g o since I came to the U .
That ' s because I pass ed my dr ive r ' s l ic en se t est !
I know many people think that pass ing and having a dr ive r ' s l ic en se is
I ' ve never dr ive n a c ar in J a p an . Even more so , I ' ve never had any trouble
with tra n s p or t ation , because my home t ow n Y o k o ha m a is very
con ve n i ent ly l o c at ed near public tra n s p or t ation .
S t ud ent s normal ly start tak ing English class es as e ar ly as p re s ch o o l and this con t in u es even after they become co ll e g e students .
It ' s not difficult to sp ot th ous and s of p ar ent s ti g h ten ing their be l t s in or d er to sen d their kid s to p ri v ate language in st it ut es .
My English name is mi b an .

The se days l want to le ar n J a p an e se , though l do n ' t know anything about it at all .
So I want to make some friend s to tea ch me as well as to im p ro ve my English .
W o ul d you like to be my friend ?
My F ir st E n t ry
I started us ing L an g - 8 to le ar n writing in English .
M a y b e , I will make many mistake s in my ent ri es .
But I have to be f l u ent in English by next year .
B e c a us e I ' ll be an e m p l o y e e of a comp an y ma k ing e le c t ri c a p p l i ance s .
English s k i ll s are ne ce s s ar y for the job .
I want to o b tain the s k i ll of a st ud ent .
If you help me le ar n English , I will help you le ar n J a p an e se .
G la d to read my ent ry .
L if e is short er than I thought .
I am 2 1 year s old but I have never thought about my future serious ly .
I saw that other s have got their own f in al dis t in ation .
Some s u c ce ed ed , some are still try ing hard t o a ch i e ve their go al s .
This made me want to be serious with my life .
E ver y on e have got dr e a m s .
I also have dr e a m s , but they are im po s s i ble to a ch i e ve soon .
I will tell you about one of my dr e a m s .
I want to study a b o ar d where I can f o c us on the ma j or I ' m interest ed in .
I co un l d n ' t tell them about this , I just kept it in my mind .
There are 5 person s in my family .
They ar e not ri ch enough to sen d me study a b o ad and I don t want to be s el f ish .
As time pass es by , It see m s that I have got the good things from my p ar ent more than my s is ter and brother got .
A fter class I just took the e le v at or down to the bu il d ing with my listen ing class teacher and two of my class m ate s .
One of my class m ate turn ed to as k the teacher on how to im p ro ve our listen ing s k i ll .
The teacher said that we should listen to the ma ter i al over and over and try to f i g ur e out all the w or d s and sen t ence s after class .
If we still c a n ' t f i g ur e out some w or d s - es pe c i ally the te ch n ical w or d s - after listen ing it over and over again , we have to try to write it down and look it up in a di ction ar y .
M o st of all , he e m p ha s i z ed that we better not read the s c ri p t from begin n ing to end .
That ' s what I le ar n ed to day .
I ' m work ing in a p u b l ish ing comp an y , and our se ction p u b l ish es month ly w ed d ing i nformation ma g a z in e / f l i er .
No w I am j o in ing in a pro j e c t to study about the w ed d ing mar ke t s of for e i g n co un t ri es , es pe c i ally of C h in a .
We dis c us s the t re n d of over se as w ed d ing of C h in e se co up le s ; in J a p an there are f e w re l i g i ous w ed d ing ce re m on ies , so some J a p an e se co up le s ch o o se the over se as w ed d ing , for ex amp le they hold ce re m on ies in H a w a i i , G u a m , and so on .
I must in ter v i e w some co up le s who had already he l d the over se as w ed d ing .
I think their fresh voice s are / will be the most im p or t ant hi n t for my pro j e c t .
9 : I want our ga r d en to be full of p in k f l ow er s in sp r ing .
I found th at most people who study J a p an e se like J a p an e se c ar t o on .
I ' m not re ally interest ed on man g a and an im e .
So I ' m going to know more about the se c ate g or y .
It mean s to insist on something no matter any difficult ies that may come up .
The e v al u ation is not re al because there is not any on e else to say so .
I always go to work by b ic y c le ,
but to day I went on f o ot because it ra in ed .
My f t got re ally so a k ed h .
This is our first time to ho st it .
