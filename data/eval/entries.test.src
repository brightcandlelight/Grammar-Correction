Yes ter day I went to dr in k ing with my friend s with when I was co ll e g e st ud ent .
One of them is work ing at J a p an e se a ut o m a k er .
Some time s he is going to around of world .
en j ot it !
I de c id ed to read al o ud with A F N b ook .
A first se ction was the in a u g ur al address of B ar a c k O b a m a as the n ation ' s 44 th p re s id ent .
U s u ally I take I - po d to he ar some m us ic and English pro g r a m s .
To day I found a new things about English .
The sen t ence is `` I can not than k you enough ``
I have felt this sen t ence sound s that person do n ' t a p p re c i ate .
Y e a I le ar n ed to day one thing to day .
I give the fish which was his sp e c i al favor ite to his gra ve .
I can think of nothing , because of I am tired now , or just p re ten d ing to be tired now .
What I am do ing now look s like nothing but coming from no where , or just it is that I have to think more to find out what is need ed .
I have trouble with study , live l i h o o d and my girl friend ( may b e leave soon )
I went to c a f e near my school to read b ook s and I walk ed for a long time .
H on est ly I have to cha ll e ng e G er man writing .
But it does n ' t mean that I give it up .
There are a l ot of st ud ent from va ri ous co un t ri es .
E ng l an s d , I ta ly , A ust ri a , S l o v a k i a , S er b i a e t c .
S in ce this was the first time for me to see S l o v a k i a un d S er b i a people ,
A l m o st all con ver s ation was in English , but I would have to say I had much difficult y to co m m un ic ate with them .
My co m m un ic ation s k i ll in English is not enough , and particular ly for listen ing .
A d d i tion to it , every body has different a c c ent s in English includ ing me .
So they tri ed to me m or i z e it as s o c i at ing with `` H i ro s h im a ( J a p an e se c ity ) ``
It sound s funny , I never hi t upon such a idea .
But I think H i ro s h i is e as i ar than H i ro s h im a , because it ' s short er , is n ' t it ?
N ic e to me e t u ~ ~ I ' m a fresh man here ~ ~ I was b or n in c he ng d u , C h in a .
I ho pe I can make friend s with u ~ ~
H o pe every on e may have a n ic e day ~ ~
T h an k u ~ ~ ~ ~
When I happen d to walk by in front of k im on o sh op , a c ut e you ng c l er k we ar ing k im on o talk ed to me with s m il ing .
Some pretty girl s we ar ing k im on o were in K y ot o or U n ive r s al S t ud i o J a p an of O s a k a on the picture s .
We talk ed about k im on o s or something for a long time .
The c l er k said , `` If you had a time , why do n ' t you try this on ? ``
O f c or se I tri ed .
B e c a us e I had an enough time and I do n ' t have any k im on o s in s te ad of y u k at a .
The k im on o which I tri ed was re ally beautiful .
I sat is f i ed with try ing it on and had f un with talk ing with the c l er k .
But K im on o is very ex p en s ive , I do n ' t a f f or d to bu y it now .
It see m s that to day will be re ally n ic e day .
In the s k y are n ' t any c l o ud s , the s un is sh in ing and no w in d .
A l s o there are 3 de g re es by C el s i us , but it only 1 1 a . m . To day I ' m going to play b as ke t b a ll in the s k ate p ar k .
B y the way in the N B A O k la h o m a C ity T h un d er s w in s ver s us L .
L a k er s and now s er ies are 2 - 2 .
m on E S T time C le ve l and will play ver s us C h ic a g o .
I ho pe C a v al i er s will w in .
It is as if sp r ing had come already here in C h u b u are a , in the c ent er of J a p an .
This is a quick di g re s s ion , and the head qu ar ter of hot T O Y O T A is here .
And y e aster day was my pay day , so I dr e w some money at A T M .
But it took no less than 1 0 0 yen to with d r a w as it is on sat ur day .
you see , just to with d r a w !
The b an k s are so bu d e t - mind ed , why should I pay money to with d r a w my money ?
What do you think ?
T h ough I make f us s over it , I take out on week en d s .
B y the way , I walk ed to the con v i ence st or e on f o ot since it ' s so near .
I could see many sp r ing f l ow er s out there , and I was able to feel sp r ing act u ally is around the corner .
I looked up other w or d s to mean w ar m and found as s n u g as a bu g in a r u g .
I found it very interest ing .
My name is p h y ten !
I am a st ud ent in H it ot s u b ash i U n ive r s ity who se de p ar t ment is e c o m ic s .
My ho b b y is . . .
G u it ar , read ing b ook s ( es pe c i ally business and f in ance ) , bad m in t on , the In ter ne t , pro g r a m m ing , and talk ing my friend s !
A l s o we can play with our ne i g h b or s , so not only we can make a friend s but also we can sp en d a time great ly .
M a y b e I gue s s there is a saying , `` There will be for t un es to people who do n ic e ly to their ne i g h b or s . `` .
If we sha re the f o o d s to our ne i g h b or s when they are becom ing poor , then we can get a f o o d s to them when they become o k a y and I became poor .
N e x t , we should get a manner .
N e i g h b or s are the part of our life and so c i e ty , and all of the people like the ne i g h b or s who are very n ic e ly .
And if we should be friend ly , help ful , and get ting a manner if we want to become a n ic e ne i g h b or .
I finish my work now .
I f i x ed a pro g r a m co d e .
On this line ' N in j a ' train s - n i j a ' s face pai n ted on - run every day .
But the train I ' m tak ing is not ' N in j a ' train .
It ' s did n t mean s I get los t but los t my b an k c ar d .
R e c ent ly , I W as always a b s ent - mind ed for any reason .
K e e p think ing something no matter walk ing on the ro ad or sit ing in the train .
A fter I find out the c ar d was not in the right place .
I po ur out the b a g and c he c k 3 time s with an x i ous .
But still c a n ' t find it .
Then , I call my family im m ed i ate ly to let them have the los e re p or t for the b an k .
I can not do this any more .
But what I can do ?
I ' ve just got home , re c ent ly I got back home l ate because of the job .
I re ally want to say than k you for every one who c or re c t my mistake s and give me a me s s age .
I am now being an ex ch an g st ud ent in A m er ic an , and this is the first time I live without my family , so my p ar ent s w or ri ed a l ot when I said good - bu y to them at the a ir p or t .
But I re as s ur ed them by saying that I would sen d e m a il .
My first g l ance at my room m ate act u ally left a very good impress ion on me because she was 5 year s old er than me , which made me feel she would s up p or t me in so many way s .
When I ar ri v ed my room , she was just with her J a p an e se bo y f ri en d , so she in t ro d u c ed him to me and told me that if I had any J a p an e se question s , I could just t um ble them out to her bo y f ri en d s .
I felt that I was so l u c k y that G o d ga ve me s u ch a n ic e room m ate because she seemed to be very pro te c t ive .
F or a girl who left home first time , it re ally help ed a l ot ! !
A t least , she ga ve a a sen se of se c ur e though her bo y f ri en d always stay ed in our room even at the be d time .
To let my room m ate know that I would bo t be a th re at to her re l ation s h i p , I always brought up my question s only when she was also in .
There f or e , she ho p ed that I could turn to other J a p an e se .
As a re s ul t , I w ro te a not e to her , apologize and made it clear t th at I did not mean to do that .
If she f el f hu r t , I would stop do ing it right away ! !
Even though her bo y f r in ed told me that he felt his girl f ri en d was too e m o tion al and that I could still con s ul t him question s when she was away , I de c line d his kind ness and almost never spoke to him .
O ri g in ally I thought that everything will just go back to normal , to the very begin n ing when I was in a good ter m with her .
However I was to t ally wrong because now she only ga ve my a co l d should er .
L a st time , I f u z z ed every time as speak ing more than usual .
S ound s ir on y , does n ; t it ?
What I mean is the more I study about express ion s or v o c a b ul ar ies , the more I ' m con f us ed , because every time I try to us e new things , it does n ' t come to my mind as a ut o m at ic ally as I wish , and it make s me m um m ur ing ( ? ) .
So I have a school tri p from 7 th to 9 th on s ept e m b er .
A l th ough I live in F u ku s h im a in J a p an , I ' ll go to Tokyo in J a p an .
So I need to be read y for school tri p soon .
So , I ' ll write about school tri p when I back home .
This le ad to no where .
I want to try myself in the ma ter i al world .
O ur turn is 1 4 : 2 5 .
I ' m going to my un ive r s ity , and start ing ch or p r a c t ic e from now on .
I live in the do r m with in ter n ation al st ud ent from the U .
She is very good at J a p an e se and always help me study English .
However , because of her good J a p an e se s k i ll , I some time s he s it ate to speak English .
M or e o ver , she always speak J a p an e se in s te ad of us ing English , so I do n ' t have enough ch ance to speak English .
There f or e , I try to de c id e `` O N L Y E N G L I S H D A Y `` and I as k her to speak only English d ur ing the day !
C ome back in time , if I could : (
A n n z u had been a str a y c at and pe c k ed by c r ow s in a p ar k , before a volunteer s a v ed her life .
When she came to my house for the first time , she was so s k in n y that we could n ' t hu g strong ly .
To day , I big in la ng - 8
I study English since I was j un i or high school st ud ent .
I can read w r ri ten paper in E m g l ish , for ex amp le new s paper s .
But I c a n ' t listen and write in English .
The class comp o se s of for st ud ent and teacher .
I have to speak w or d s many time s , so it is pro f it able .
G o s s i p G ir l is a pro p ul ar A m er ic a T V s er ies that was in t ro d u c ed to C h in a as fashion and life style b ook .
In the show s , S er an a and B la ir are the most l u c k girl who is ri ch and be at i ful , cha r m and so on .
They po s se s s all the thing which was most girl want to have in the world over all .
The people in the U p p er e a st live in go r g i ous and la v ish , but they are el ite who know how to man age a m ul t in ation al c or p or ation even though may b e in he ri ted from family .
O b v i ous ly , they are sp ot light in any part ies at N e w y or k night .
we are mo r t al , direct ly I en v y that kind of bu le b l o o d people .
Let me c ite a fashion al w or d `` hold `` which is f at a c y of a am a z ing girl in C h in a .
I want to N Y some day .
One of serious pro ble m s in J a p an .
I watch ed T V new s which is about high number s of s u ic id e d ur ing y on g er age from about 2 0 to 3 0 year s old people .
The new s told that the number s con t in u e to in c re a se over 1 0 year s .
E x a c t l ly I think that most y on g er people in J a p an have no dr e a m or p ur s po se to the future .
Then they feel themselves as us e less in the world , no reason to live any m or e .
A n y way , present time , we are much ri ch er ma ter i ally than past but our mind s got we a k en .
And J a p an e se so c i e ty is in a g ing so c i e ty and we run out of work for ce of y on g er people .
Some h ow we must stop you ng er people s u ic id e or our so c i e ty will co ll a p se very soon er than we expect ed .
I had been to O it a , my home town , for about three week s for s um m er va c ation , and I came back home three days before .
I felt a fresh a p p re c i ation of my p ar ent s this time because of going back my home town .
I also re al i z ed how I had ever been having l u x ur i ous life .
I did n ' t feel ing l on e ly before I went back to O it a , but still if I go back once , I will be a c c ust ome d to my original life that has any do g s , s is ter and p ar ent s , so when I was alone , I felt l on e ly very much .
But in fact , I ' m understand ing it is too bad for me because I ' ll go a b ro ad in A m er ic a for four year s as a un ive r s ity st ud d ent .
No body in my friend s live my house near b y , so when ever I go sh op p ing , I am alone .
It is only a matter of time to start my class , so I ' m look ing for w ar d to see ing my friend s now .
It happen d a f e w month s a g o .
That day , I was w at ing for a train at p l at f or m as us us al .
The woman , she seemed to be over 5 0 year s - old , came near
where I was stand because there was public p h on e near me .
She put money into p h on e then di al led .
`` O h , I ' m sorry I ' ll be l ate `` the woman talk ed with big voice that
she con t in u ed talk ing .
`` I was po o ing .
it was re ally big one so it took a long time to f l ash . ``
so I mi s s ed a train .
I ' m sorry I was here on time but it could n ' t be f l ash ed ``
She de s p er ate ly explain ed not her fault but her po o ' s fault .
Some time s people make an ex c us e for their mistake s such as t ar d y .
However , I have never heard such an ch il d ish ex c us e .
O th re w is e , any body be l ive her .
E ver y day , going to the comp an y , I watch ed the v id e o on the i P o d to u ch .
R e c ent ly It is `` the s es a m i street ``
It is for study ing English .
`` S es a m i street `` is f un for me .
But it E x c ite ment story tired me some time s .
The w or d E x c ite ment mean s `` H i - ten s y on ``
M a y b e it is wrong English .
`` s es a m i street `` is us e ful for study ing e ng l ish .
that `` less ex c ite ment `` e ng l ish study ing v id e o .
I had a dr e a m that I dr o ve a c ar and a c ar f e ll off from the ro ad .
I had lie down before I c he c k ed the e - ma il yesterday .
So , may b e I think I might have a all er g y to po ll en .
In sp r ing sea s on I become a dr y s k in and my eyes is very it ch y . . .

My name is K A O R I , live in J a p an O s a k a .

J a p an e se go ver n ment w ar n ed people that there was po s s i b il ity of e le c t ri c p ow er f a il ur e in Ka n t o re g ion yesterday after no on .
Tokyo p ow er comp an y had already stop p ed their s er v ic e in the s ch ed ul ed are a .
But they said p ow er still was not enough .
And I f il led p la st ic bo t t le s , p ot s and bu ke c t with water as much as possible .
We could n ' t us e water , if we had p ow er f a il ur e .
My a p ar t ment serve s water to each family with e le c t ri c p ow er .
F or t un ate ly , we a v o id ed the c ri s is , though all A T M did n ' t work te m p or ar i ly in one of M a j or J a p an e se B an k .
the a ut um n a p p ro a ch es .
It was ra in n ing day .
The we a ther of K or e a is a little co l d with the change of sea s on s .
F or that reason , I thought a l ot of things .
So , I ' m ment ally over l o ad ed .
I could do with something f un !
Yes ter day , I ha ng ed out to re la x .
I walk ed from S h i b u y a to H ar a j u ku and return to S h i b u y a .
It was a n ic e we a ther , so I f a ll well .
It was a ha p p y day , because I went to sp ot I never go .
I for g ot what I want ed to write to day .
My ce ll p h on e has n ' t been work ing well .
I thought my ce ll p h on e at last b ro ke down serious ly because even when I p re s s ed the but t on s , it did n ' t re a c t at all .
On being in the sit u ation , I was almost los ing my comp o s ur e .
No soon er than had I not ic ed that than I went to my friend ' s room who se ce ll p h on e is the same ty pe as mi ne .
He was study ing , but I b ro ke in because I did n ' t a f f or d to care for him .
He ga ve me some piece s of i nformation about the ce ll p h on e and suggest ed that I call the c ust ome r c ent er of the comp an y .
F in ish ed his story , I tri ed to call soon .
The moment I called to the c ust ome r c ent er , I not ic ed that I was us ing my ce ll p h on e and it was work ing as usual .
I think it is because of my a g ing .
E ver y time I ' m writing an es s a y , I us ed a l ot of the same tra n s i tion al w or d s .
If you know a l ot of va ri e t ies of tra n s i tion al w or d s such as more o ver , in addition , thus , there f or e , in short , e t c , could you please let me know ?
I have l ot s of work to do , but I need to keep my le ar n ing time some h ow .

So may b e I should p r a c t ic e English of ten , ho p ing that L an g - 8 do help .

How do I become better English speak er ?

A c t u ally , a live c ir c us was interest ing ,
My d aught er ' s pleasure was the be st for me on this show .
But if some on e as k me to go again , I w o n ' t go even I pay .
R e c ent ly I was a b it la z y . . .
de c ent : H is father want ed him to get de c ent education , so his family mo v ed from his country .
in no c ent : He tri ed to pro ve his in no c ence , but no one did n ' t believe what he said .
s es it ive : She said her s k in is sen s it ive to every st im ul i so she does n ' t w an n a go on a hi ke .
serious : I thought she was j o k ing , but when I looked at her face , it was quite serious so I re al i z ed she was saying the tru th .
no ble : I think every person need something no ble in their life .

I wonder if the us age of `` serious `` a b o ve is c or re c t .
T h an k you for always writing commen t .
I ' m ha p p y and it is st ud i ed .

The new se m est er will start from next week and some class will begin at 1 1 a . m .
It ' s a sh ame to let them just pass for la z y sleep ing .
So I w a ke up at 8 a .
It ' s not easy for me to w a ke up e al ry and some time s I feel an ir re st it i ble ur g e to sleep in day time , but still I man age to get out of be d at least 8 a .
I have an a p po in t ment to me e t my bo s s in the new work p la ce tomorrow a b it l ate night .
I will fight myself to keep me a w a ke tomorrow ! !
That includ ed electronic di ction ar y that I b or r ow ed from her long time a g o .
I had for g ot ten to return but she s ud d en ly called me and asked to return .
So I found in my desk and she sen t it with some so u ve n ir .
I called my mo m and let her know it was sen t from my w if e this morning .
A fter I finish ed my work , I me t a friend who is me m b er of same English c ir c le .
She has a l ot of D V D s which was co un ted over 2 0 0 !
I in t ro d u c ed the L an g - 8 to her .
I said it was good for study .
Then we went for dr in k a little and had a good time to talk .
She said she want ed to begin study ing English ra d i o pro g r a m .
So we will study the same pro g r a m and c he c k what we le ar n every week .
No soon er did I come back home by b ic y c le than did the ra in f a ll .
Yes ter day I b ough t a great de al of ri p en to m at o es .
I should or , act u ally , I have to study hard this week - end , but you know , there ' s always some stuff that catch my at ten tion more than study ing .
What is H a p p i ness ? P ar t 2
While I was listen ing to her story , I was look ing at my dinner that already became co l d .
B o th we were n ' t eat ing .
She some time s show ed me her tea r s and s i g h ed .
A c t u ally I had no idea to en c o ur age her , so I de c id ed to become a good listen er .
However , I listen ed to her story s il ent ly .
A ll I could do was to gr i p her hand s .
To tell you to the tru th , I re ally want ed to hu g her , but I could n ' t because I did n ' t want to surprise her .
H u g g ing is n ' t a part of J a p an e se c ul ture .
That ' s life .
It become s c he a p er comp ar ed with before .
T h ough the or i g in of go l f is un c le ar , it see m s that she p h er d s knock ed stone s into ra b b it ho le s is an est a b l ish ed the or y .
If it has been re m a in ing , the co st is nothing , right ?
A n y way , I want to see T i g er play go l f great ly .
It is hard ra in to day .
In J a p an , a l ot of ty p h o on come in S ept e m b er .
I am w or ri ed about the way home .
P ro b ably the train will stop .
My in ter p re ter ' s class was so t ough for me at last less on .
The them e was `` A bout so c i al part ic i p ation in J a p an . ``
One of my class m ate present ed that J a p an e se n ation is str a g g ling and f a c ing l ow e c on o m ical also po l it ical .
F or the past twenty year s , E s pe c i ally middle - a g ed me n has much a b il it ies and p ow er ful l .
They could con t ro led all over the J a p an .
However they do n ' t have enough a b il it ies and display now .
So we need get second w in d .
In the future more people who are w ome n , no n - re s id ence and you th would be part ic i p ate in any so c i al mo ve ment s .
It ' ll be better than now .
That them e was felt a b st r a c t for me .
I thought she should have present more de ta il conc re te .
We are , natural ly , always look ing for the be st me th o d , the f a st est way , the e as ies t p at ch to m aster ing English , J a p an e se , S p an ish , what ever ish . . .
On the other hand , good me th o d s [ As s im il ? ] when wrong ly us ed can pro d u ce poor re s ul t s .
In the end , what you should know , what you should [ at least you should . . . ] not ic e by your s el f is that there is n ' t A M E T H O D for language le ar n ing .
E a ch st ud ent have to find his own me th o d , his own way of le ar n ing .
O f course this is n ' t an easy thing to do .
I know some things work and some do n ' t , but to find out ex a c t ly how do it is n ' t that easy .
A ll me th o d s have good and bad point s , so what you have to do is not ic e the good point s and us e it in your way .
O f course I ' m being a b it s ta g y , but I just want to show that there is n ' t one me th o d that r ul es over all other s .
If you work - hard on it , you probab ly will not only find out what le ar n ing me th o d s and str ate g ies s u it you better , but you also will start to not ic e some un ive r s al p r in c i p le s about language le ar n ing .
The a ver age language le ar n er , who usual ly follow s just one me th o d s ( like many English teacher here in B r a z il who have le ar n ed English us ing the same me th o d for more than 2 0 year s ) , will probab ly not le ar n the se p r in c i p le s and , there f or e , become kind of limit ed when it come s to how to le ar n a language .
We had a very good time play ing cha s ing game in the water .
I ' m very ha p p y to see t at my d aught er started to have more con f id ent in the water because she could n ' t put her face in the water before she go es to s w im m ing less on s .
She was even s c ar e of get ting a b it of sp l ash on her face when she had a show er .
No w she can head - stand in the water !
As her school will have a s w im m ing less on start ing soon , ho pe ful ly she has no pro ble m in the water and can enjoy s w im m ing with other s .
I can tell the ch l or in e in the po o l was very strong since even though a b it of sp l ash of the water hu r t s my eyes quite a b it .
In addition to that , I felt re ally tired after get ting out of the water al th ough I had n ' t s w im much .

It is difficult for me to speak and write with English .
And let ' s tell own language each other ! !
My think ing was brought to a stand st i ll .
I have no idea for that .
So , it is nothing and nothing again .
Where does my in s p ir ation go ?
I tra v ed with my class 3 days a g o .
A l th ough we were tired but every body felt please d .
We took many p h ot o , about 7 0 0 picture s .

I need friend , and need con t ent with person s , however , the people do n ' t like me , I think so .
who can help me or tell me what could I do ?
My an x i ous
He had s m o k ed with his friend s se c re t ly .
H is class teacher came to my house .
He told me what had happen ed unti l now .
This is the first time that I have heard their circumstance s .
I thought that my so n want ed to es c a pe from being for c ed
I re f le c ted on myself a l ot and I said to him .
`` You do not have to study so much , so that you should stay home any way . ``
I have heard the sound of walk ing on the ro o f .
One day the voice has been heard out of his room , so I tri ed to open the do or of his room .
Then , I saw two bo y s who hi d behind the bu n k be d .
I per s u ad ed them about a f e w things .
I am sorry that you do not keep the pro m is es with me about stop p ing s m o k ing and study ing hard er .
How should I do ?
This is my first try to this sit e .
So I would like to co m m un ic ate who ever want s to .
I ten d to be l ive in g h o st because I was b or n in small town .
The p op ul ation of my two n was l ow .
My ne i g h b or ' s house was old so it is easily b ro k en if the ty po on come in our re g in .
B e f or e I tri ed to sleep at n i g th t I always went to re st ro o m and I can see their house .
I c a n ' t do anything because I was k i z s .
I called my mo m : He y I found a c ock ro a ch so please k i ll them .
co m on mo m !

I of ten us e something like that .
My high school ( 4 )
They th ri ll ed me near ly through o ut the school year of G r ad e T w o .
O f course , I was w or ri ed about that my be ha v i or was found as I was enjoy ing them .
My be ha v i or was found at last .
I was s us p en d ed to make a s el f - ex a m in ation .
A t begin n ing , though , I found that I could not catch up with my less on s , for I had mi s s ed so many less on s .
In this way , it took me four year s to finish the three - year j un i or high school .
She like d a new ho s o it al because do c ter explain ed her well .
It ' s very easy le ve l .
I heard it ' s good to read many b ook s in s u it able le ve l .
No w , the number of w or d s I read is 2 666 w or d s .
i P o d n an o the 5 th g en er ation
I b ough t an i P o d n an o the 5 th g en er ation last D e ce m b er .
So it is not easy for me to us e M a c style .
I can im p or t m us ic into i P o d n an o but c a n ' t understand the way about any picture s .
F in ally , to day , I found out how to im p or t some picture s into i P o d n an o !
I am very ha p p y for do ing that .
I had a very bu s y day to day , because I had two class es , c he c k ed students ' not e b ook s , there was a b is i ness tri p .
I was going to go to con ver s ation al English class , but English teacher c aught a co l d yesterday , so to day ' s less on was c ance led .
I went to the M e x ic an re st a ur ant `` E l To ri t o `` to night and at e E n ch il ad a , S al s a ch i p s , C e as er s ar ad a , and ic e c re a m and dr un k M ar g ar it a which was f ro z en with s al t f r ing e around the g la s s .
I like M ar g ar it a very much , but it s al c o h o l le ve l is kind of high , so I ' m always get ting sleep y after dr in k ing .
There are many t v s c re en s ha ng ing on the wall and the t v cha n n el is always sp or t s cha n n el `` E S P N . `` To day ' s sp or t s was b a se b a ll .
f o ot b a ll sea s on will start on A u g ust . . . . .
so now what we can watch is b a se b a ll game s and ho c ke y game s .
To day is the G u y F a w ke s N i g h t ( or bo n f i re night ) in O x f or d .
A l th ough it is off ic i ally the f if th of No ve m b er , the even t is set to S at ur day night this year .
L a st year my w if e and I went to the bo n f i re he l d at the So u th P ar k .
A l th ough it was a ch il ling night , the large p ar k was full of c r ow d s .
G u y F a w ke s tri ed to b la st the P ar l i a ment in or d er to k i ll K ing J ame s I of E ng l and and V I of S c ot l and , but f a il ed and ar re st ed on the f if th of No ve m b er in 1 6 0 5 .
The f a il ed as s as s in ation attempt is now called as the g un p ow d er p l ot .
F or some reason , the B ri t ish have been ce le b r at ing this day with bo n f i re and f i re w or k s for more than 4 0 0 year s .
I ' m not even sure that the B ri t ish are either in f a v o ur of or against G u y F a w ke s himself and his p l ot .
In my opinion , most of them may be tak ing a d v ant age of his f a il ed attempt to enjoy f i re w or k s with a good reason .
F or me as a J a p an e se , f i re w or k s on a co l d a ut um n night are very un us u al and even s ur re al ex pe ri ence , since f i re w or k s are ic on s of the hot t est s um m er sea s on in J a p an , re m in d ing me the hu m id and hot a ir , girl s we ar ing y u k at a ( by the way , girl s with y u k at a look 3 0 % more at t r a c t ive and p re t t i er then usual ) , k a k i g or i ( c r us h ed ic e with f r u it - f la v o ur ed s y r up ) , and so on .
When a B ri t ish `` guy `` visit s J a p an and see s f i re w or k s f est i v al s in s um m er , what so r t of e m o tion s would he re g is ter ?
D r ow s i ness

A fter school start , I do n ' t have much time to do something I want to do .

We are c r a z y now .
O ur teachers are funny , and I j o in a mo d er n dr a m a c l u b .

In my new life , it ' s full of ha p p y and f un .
T h ro u th , it is a l ot of p re s s ur e .
So , I need to study hard now .
I b ough t some st ock s in last O c t .
S in ce then , I ' ve been interest ed in e c on o m ic s so much .
The e c on o m ic s in J a p an is easy to be affect e ed by that of for e i g n country ( es pe c i ally U S ) .
O f course not only J a p an , many co un t ri es ' e c on o m ic s is affect ed by other co un t ri es ' it .
No w , in my country , many people were f ir ed their job s , and what is w or se , it ' s difficult for any people to find new job .
There ' re many bad new s in this way now . . .
However , do n ' t you think it ' s interest ing that the re l ation s h i p of e c on o m ic s between a country and another country ?
I think it ' s still too e ar ly for me to talk about e c on o m ic s in e ng l ish .
S in ce I ' d like to know about the se place s as much as possible , I am read ing g u id e b ook s and c he c k ing the in ter ne t every d s a y .
I H a ve A w ar e
R e c ent ly , I ' ve a w ar e of it ' s not easy to e ar n money .
We never e ar n money at the time of do ing .
M a y b e there are some works that can get l ot s of money a day .
But I do n ' t think they are a b s o l ut e ly good works .
H a ve a no ce day ! !

I had a only class in man age ment to day . it was b or ing ,
it mean t that f in al - ex a m is coming soon .
may b e I go n n a be c r a z y . . . . .
but I am not in mo o d to study . . . . I am la z y . . . . . .
by the way I am about to leave for my home
to day my co ll e age will hold even t ! I think it will be f un !
this even t hold in once a year .
I could me e t a l ot friend s ! I am very ex c i ed !

I was going to play ten n is the after no on .
But what make s the se two v id e o s to t ally different .
When it sh in es , I will hold your hand s and to g e ther we will walk along the street s
To day I ' d like to talk a story about a dr un k who los t his ke y s .
It ' s f a m ous j o ke , so may b e you have heard .
I think it is a simple story but can tea ch us im p or t ant less on about our life .
One night , a man go es out dr in k ing at a l o c al b ar .
A fter saying good b y e to his friend s , he begin s walk ing home , s ing ing ha p p i ly to himself .
As he near s his a p ar t ment , he take s his ke y s out of his pocket but dr op s them on the gr ound in the dark .
On re al i z ing his ke y s are mi s s ing , he w and er s over to a near b y street l amp and begin s look ing for them there .
I had a trouble with my English .
T h ough I le ar n ed English for a long time .
I knew my pro ble m was that I c ound ' t catch the mean s what people said , and my pro n un c i ation was too bad .
I want ed to be able to m aster English con ver s ation , but I sp ent my much time study ing gra m m ar , even I tri ed to read new s p a p er and no ve l s .
A ll study is help ful , but it is n ' t effect ive .
It is im p or t ant for me to know what I want and f o c us on that .
J a p an e se come d i an s some time s p ar o d y for e i g n er ' s J a p an e se speak ing s .
The f e a ture s are o m it ting part ic le s , wrong a c c ent s and into n ation s and it see m s that they can be c ate g or is ed by n ation al it ies .
I suppose this may be tru e from my ex pe ri ence s and a c ut u ally English ch il d re n le ar n n ur se ry r h y m e in a language a c qu is i tion .
O ther w is e , if J a p an e se le ar n er s mi m ic ed their r h y th m even if it was strange J a p an e se , they might o b tain a s k i ll to speak natural ly .
J un z o Ka w ad a is a re se ar ch er in c ul t ur al an th ro po l o g y and he went to A f ri c a to re se ar ch a tri b e that do not have letter s .
He c la m ed that they have im a g in ation in their mind s and they con ve y them to the dr um .
When I listen ed to this story , I thought this is like ty p ing a ke y b o ar d .
And there are a c ut u ally some r h y th m p at ter n s when I hi t the ke y b o ar d .
It take s about a mi n u e t to the st ation .

I asked him what should I do .
He said you co ud get out by no far e , next time you get in our bu s , you should tell the dr ive r this story , and pay this far e .
I than k ed him , and got out of the bu s .
In the way to my home from bu s stop , I was so a k ing we t .
H i every one , n ic e to me e t you .
B e c a us e G un m a is not a f a m ous like Tokyo , and K ir y u is a country s id e in such a p re f e c ture .
I had to charge e le c t ri c ity and in ter ne t .
In T an z an i a , almost everything is an a d v ance pay ment s y s te m while everything is a la ter p a ment in K or e a .
I us e an a d v ance pay ment e le c t ri c ity which is called L U K U in here .

I may like an al c o h o l : - (
We have good time there , be u c a se our house is big g er than our house that we live 1 month a g o .
It is not n ation al sp or t ,
but we can watch every pro g r a m at N H K n at in al T V b ro ad c a st .
In J a p an , It is he l d 6 time s per year ,

I had p l an n ed to go s k i ing with my family this week en d .
But I c ance led when we heard this dis aster .
It would have been the first time for my ch il d re n to go s k i .
R e c ent ly I had in s o m n i a .
I felt very tired .
What sha ll I do ?
ne c k is st if f and back so re too .
What the di f f er ence between `` can `` and `` k in `` ?
To day ' s work
I have to make a do c u ment by this F ri day .
I finish ed ma k ing a do c u ment to day .
I visit ed one c l i ent to have a meeting with my s ta f f .
In this meeting , there was a hard ne g ot i ation for us .
We dis c us s ed about how to op er ate this de al .
F in a ly we agree d with next dis c us s ing point s and f i x ed a next meeting d ate .
P o ll en is blow n every where .
It become w ar m and con f or t able to go outside .
P o ll en make s me he y sick .
When I was look ing up the w or d ' a g it ate ' in di ction ar y , I found an ex amp le which co on f us ed me .
A big mo s qu it o have b it ten me !
There is mo s qu it o in my room .
It look s like very big .
He already eat my b l o o d d ur ing I had take a n a p a co up le of while .
I do n ' t want live with him all night long . . .
My friend who J a p an e se listen care ful ly th i er sound then He can know that they are ma le or f e m al e .
I think that if they are ma le , they do n ' t want to get my b l o o d .
I c a n ' t do that like my friend .
But I gue s s a mo s qu it o which in my room is f e m al e .
B e c a us e they had b it ten my body two point s .
I am it ch ing now . . . .
On our pro j e c t meeting , we talk about what each person try next week .
A n y way , we have a kind of strange c ust o m for ch ri st m as .
E at ing K F C ch i k en is one of the ex amp le for our un i qu e c ust o m for ch ri st m as .
My c ous in said my di ar ies always write so short , but I do n ' t know what can I write in the di ar y ?
M o s qu it o es are like this we a ther .
They f ly in the house when some on e open s the do or .
I am in a train on the way to my un ive r s ity .
When ever I ' m in a train , I ' m o b s er v ing people in there , es pe c i ally those who are on the op po s ite she at I ' m sit ting down .
A bout 1 0 people can sit down on the she at , but I can see 5 people at first sight .
No w , three girl s are play ing their mo b i le and two old guy s are sleep ing .
A h , the train ar ri v ed at the st ation , so I have to change the train .
As written on this di ar y of No ve m b er 4 th , one of our man age r s le c ture d on co st man age ment .
The me as ur e ment of f al ling b ir th r ate
D P J ' s ma in po l ic y for f al ling b ir th r ate is g i v ing 2 6 0 0 0 y en per one ch il d per month to p ar ent s .
I think it ' s not enough and not a good po l ic y .
I read an e c on o m is t opinion on paper that said `` B i g comp an y should set up a day - care c ent er for ch il d re n . `` S ame paper said the It o ch u , a f a m ous tra d ing comp an y , set up the day - care c ent er .
A ccord ing to this ar t ic le , the M it s u i B us s an and the S um it o m o S h o j i , which are also f a m ous tra d ing comp an ies , already have their day - care c ent er .
I think the comp an y has it s day - care c ent er is very good idea , and very good me as ur e ment for f al ling b ir th r ate .
M o st of father s or mother s should go day - care c ent er on their way to office and they take more time for co m m ut ing .
But if their comp an y has day - care c ent er they can go to their office with their ch il d re n without time con s um ing .
If day - care c ent er is near their office , they can easily go there to watch their ch il d re n life .
So I wish many comp an ies set up their own day - care c ent er near their office and many people can work easily with their ch il d re n .
It ' s start my di ar y .
R e c ent ly , every day is very hot ! !
then I tri ed sleep a g a a in .
that was too tired to do in the morning .
I ' m work ing at a d o mission c ent er of un ive r c ity in J a p an .
I do n ' t like office work , but my co ll e a g s is very funny .
so I can keep work ing my job .
my bo s s ga ve us ic e c re a m some time s .
but I de c id ed to go a b ro d or take part in work ing ho l i day next year .
that it , to day .
I have to more study ing English .
If you go and look at the mo on , it see m s that it mo ve s with you .
And , if you ' ll look on it care ful ly , you could not ic e that it has hu man ' s face , no se , the raise d e y e b r ow s , l o ve ly smile . . .
One dark night , then I r a D m it ri e v a was coming home , but this mo on ' s smile was n ' t l o ve ly for her .
Q u ite the con t r ar y - the mo on `` told `` her very hu m il i at ing : `` You ' ll se , how you will be me t at home .
It ' s so l ate to come there . ``
I r a looked on the gr ound and thought : `` If only my p ar ent s were s l i p p ing ! ``
She want ed to b l ame some on e , but she knew that she could n ' t .
I r a looked f a st on the w in d ow s , of her f l at , on the f if th floor .
D es p ite I r a ' s ho pe s there was a light in the w in d ow s .
`` So , what I should say ?
I r a re m e m b er ed how sound s the voice of her m um , then she was a ng ry .
I r a was too s c ar ed .
I went to watch a mo v i e called `` B ro k en English `` alone yesterday .
Yes ter day , I got a day off s ud d en ly and I wonder ed what I would do .
Even t u ally , I watch ed it , but it was re ally b or ing .
It was about a lady who f a ll in l o ve with a F re n ch man .
I thought he could n ' t speak English f l u ent ly and it was the reason of the ti t le , but he could .
He did mistake only one w or d , it was A ng ry and H un g ry .
He said he was hung ry , but she c aught he was a ng ry .
It was re ally funny because his English was re ally f l u ent ly .
I have finish ed two line draw ing ( hand m ad e s ke t ch es on paper ) , I in ten d ed to co l or it in class tomorrow , so teacher could c or re c t me s im ut an e ous ly .
she went to see a do c t or in big ho s p it al .
And yesterday , came back her re s ul t .
The re s ul t of a b l o o d t est and C T s c an were all normal .
A c t u ally , she was ter ri ble con st i p ation . . . .
B e c a us e of my do u b t s I re se ar ch ed something about this to p ic on in ter ne t and I dis c o ver ed that for some people it ' s not easy .
but I think this t est will last five minute s !
The ch amp ion s le a gue ' s 2 n d le g s of the qu ar ter f in al s were he l d yesterday and to day .
In qu ar ter f in al s , R a ul who be l on g s to S ch al ke got the go al s in the 1 st le g and the 2 n d le g , which ga ve me go o se p um p s .
I start la ng - 8 to day .
I ' ve been think ing why I want to study English .
Then to night I got a part of answer .
I have a feel ing that it is different from every body .
But every body has a something reason why they want to study second la un g u age .
I want to study hard for explain ing my answer .
When I was a ch il d I first watch ed this mo v i e .
It was am a z ing , the story line in p at ic ul ar .
In the last scene of this mo v i e , D o c d ropped an im p or t ant c able on the ro o f of the school many time s .
I also m o st de st ro y ed the T V in a ng er .
I can im a g in e , after this mo v i e re le as ed , many A m ri c an kid s play ed with s k ate b o ar d s on the ro ad .
I think the be st way s to le ar n K or e an is same as English .
The be st way for listen ing is watch ing K or e an dr a m as or mo v ies .
I will give to you .
R e ad al o ud even though you do n ' t understand mean ing s .
E ver y day , read al o ud K or e an b ook s , you will m aster it .
If you do n ' t have a friend to talk , you can talk to me through s k y pe .
M a y b e , you can speak K or e an to your family , even though they do n ' t understand it .
It is a good p r a c t ic e .
I think it is the hard est one .
The be st way is write something s in this we b s ite and as k n at ive K or e an s to c or re c t them .
I , act u ally , ha ted to study English when I was in high school .
A n n ir er s ar y C e le b r ation O f My C o ll e g e
A p ri l 1 8 th , it ' s a sp e c i al day .
It just be tomorrow and will be bu st ling with no is e and ex c ite ment I think .
I will be bu s y to receiv e our al um n us in that day , because many al um n us will come to my school with ex c ite ment .
Some of them have been great success in so c i e ty , so they want to see their A l m a M at er ' s de ve l op ment in re c ent year s .
My school has come through 5 0 year s ' sp le n d id history .
And I ant ten d it in 2 0 0 7 , it has de ve l op ed great .
It ' s full name is J i an g x i U n ive r s ity of T r ad i tion al C h in e se M ed ic in e .
D o you ever gra t u ate from un ive r s ity ?
J ust tell me something of your school .
D r an k with my C o - works
Yes ter day , I went to dr in k with my co - works in a I Z A K A Y A .
I sp ent f e w hour s read ing e - ma il s .
I could n ' t finish all of my work to day , but I can take another va c ation from this week en d .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to get the va c ation .
I need the certain am o un t of salary to s up p or t my family , however my salary is not good .
So y est ar day , I saw some job hu n t ting we b s ite s .
D o n ' t tell me `` Why did not you wait for your mar ri age unti l you get a high stand ar d job ? `` A t that time I was very de s p er ate to set t le down in S ing a po re .
N e ed less to say , speak ing for e i g n language like a n at ive speak er is almost im po s s i ble for every body ex c ept for n at ive b il ing u al s .
But for me , `` business English `` sound s like . . . `` almost per f e c t English . `` As far as I can see , there are not such s up er J a p an e se work er s .
A re there many J a p an e se people who can speak English like n at ive speak er s some where in S ing a po re where I do n ' t know yet ?
What the he ll business English is it ?
L a st night my friend to le me L an g - 8 , and I think it is very good for st u day e ng l ish . .
I wish to make f ir en d s with you guy s . . .
To day is a beautiful s un n y day and S at ur day !
I usual ly sp en d week en d s to go sh op p ing or do ex c a c is e or just re la x .
I always think that to keep a di ar y in English is a good way to p la c t ic e my English s k i ll s .
But , un f or t un at ly , I qu it in a way to do it .
There f or e , I ch o se to j o in in this L an g - 8 !
It has pass ed for 1 year since I came the U . S .
But my English was not im p ro ve , one thing that I felt is I am not afraid of English any more even thought I could not what people said .
In other w or d s , I do not care about the s ur ro ud ing people .
I do n ' t know it is good or bad .
I have still been e age r that I wish I could us e English like as n at ive .
S e c on d , I am going to go sh op p ing .
I ho pe I have a good week en d , and also all of you have that too !
A t first , when I did n ' t understand mean ing s of new w or d s , I l o o d k ed up the w or d s in the di ction ar y .
But , at that way , I did n ' t read quick ly .
( If the b ook be l on g to me , I read by that way .
I understand a con t ent unti l now and will finish read ing by J un . 2 1 .
T h an k you for watch ing .
He ll o my name is `` po b ir on `` , I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent in J a p an .
In the f e a ture I would like to us e English in my work .
My friend told me this we b sit e .
And if you know good place for my study a b ro ad , please tell me : D
I will go to the gradua te school next year .
In J a p an , most gradua te students start look ing for a job in their first year ( ex c ept for those who go to do c t or course ) .
I ' d like to ex pe ri ence work ing in over se as co un t ri es before look ing for a job .
So , I ' m think ing about tak ing a year off and j o in ing in ter n s h i p pro g r a m in E ur o pe an co un t ri es .
I w ro te that I of ten l ic k s my l i p before .
It was B ur t ' s B e es of an A m er ic an so u ve n ir .
I feel my l i p is en ri ch ed .
I ' ve not been for a half of year .
It is g en er ally accept h ed that our country it is called J a p an has been in f l u ence d by many great person s a cross the country .
I think one woman s ing er is the l ate st great person who pro d u ce s p ow er ful effect on J a p an .
I would like to write about her im p a c t in this es s s a y .
F or ex amp le , she of ten s ing s her name in her so ng s .
No t only so ng s but also fashion style is so un i qu e .
F O r ex amp le , she change her ha ir co l o ur into strange co l o ur s ; w h ite , y e ll ow and gr e en .
He r co st um es also se x y and un us u al .
R e c ent ly , she w or e b al c k on ion co st um e when she appeared on `` R o o m of the T e t s u k o `` which is j a p an e se f a m ous T V pro g r a m because T e t s u k o ' s ha ir style look s like on ion .
F ir ther m or e , L A D Y G A G A ga ve te t s u k o can d y that she took out it from her sp ir al ha ir .
M an y j a p an e se people were so surprise d .
I went to b a se b a ll game .
I am H an s h in T i g er s side .
And I saw some on e were us ing J a p an e se f la g s on the ble a ch er s .
No th ing pro ble m , but it does n ' t f it with b a se b a ll game .
No r m ally they us e H an s h in T i g er s f la g .
Then I could see they were for e i g n er .
And then I can understand .
It is the most im p or t ant !
In J a p an , that call new year ' s `` H O U F U `` .
M o st of `` H O U F U `` is about their works .
A t J a p an e se work p la ce ' s part y , almost people talk about work .
I tired that to p ic s .
h m m . English is easy , but people s are regard as st if f .
why are people s think e ng l ish very difficult ?
act u ally , e ng l ish is very simple , s m ar t .
who do make e ng l ish difficult ?
e ng l ish teacher !
they are saying that e ng l ish is hard to you .
so you need s help such as friend , teacher , and so on .
this is a lie .
When I ' m de p re s s ed , I feel everything will be bad way .
I c a n ' t con ne c t with my bo y f ri en d , because he is at the part y and h ook up the girl .
One of my friend s ha v n ' t re p l i ed my e - ma il because she got in trouble or she does n ' t w an n a talk with me .
I dr e ame d some body of my family di e and w a ke up as I ' m c ry ing .
A c t u ally nothing happen d bad things .
How can I w a ke up from here ?
To day I ga ve a present ation .
R e a g ar d ing long in t ro d u ction , I could speak well and con f id ent ly .
In addition , I did n ' t get n er v ous at all .
However , I f a il ed to i ll ust r ate next sub j e c t .
A n y way I finish ed it than k s to friend s and our teacher .
I felt I need ed to make l ot s of effort to im p ro ve my English here a fter .
Some day I want to give a good present ation like other students .
A fter the less on , I went to l i b r ar y to return a D V D .
Then , I went to a g g en c y to up g r ad e my dr ive l ic ence , but it turn ed out It see m s to me that I w o n ' t up g r ad e it .
I need to sub m it a c er t if ic ation , but it see m s like I c a n ' t get it , As long as I sen d J a p an e se e m b as s y for it , I c a n ' t get it .
A fter that I went to a b an k to he ar some i nformation to open b an k account .
On the way to home , I d ropped by an a p p l i ance st or e in So u th g ate and I b ough t a p or t able ra d i o .
J o h n , kind c l er k , re c o m m en d a good one .
B el ive it or not , it works with so l ar p ow er and it also has the d y n a m o c r an k .
O f course I got it .
A fter that I went to a b ic y c le sh op and they only hand le sp e c i al ty pe b ic y c le .
It turn ed out I went in va in .
A n y way finish ing the present ation was a big l o ad off my mind .
O op s , I for g ot that I would take a f in al ex a m in ation tomorrow .

My name is N at al i e and I ' m from K i e v .
A l ot of people has smile s on their f a y se s .
L ad y s just began to we ar light co at s and high he el bo ot s .
There were something beautiful and all ur ing on p al e and a little b it gr e y face s of the strange r s .
The time when you pro m is e to your s el f to start a new life .
So or y , to day ` s j o ur n al is so simple .

He just compli ment ed me on my voice .
I us ed to write C h in e se di ar ies but la ter I change d to write English writing and now I give up both of them because I want to you to help me with my English writing and also give myself the ch ance to p r a c t ic e my English ty p ing sp e ed .
I am not good at it so I tri ed a l ot .
This morning I did n ' t have class es so as usual I stay ed at the s el f - study room and did some study ing .
It is very interest ing and I almost finish it so I am e age r to make it as soon as possible .
I usual ly run ten la p s ; each la p is four hu n d r ed me ter s long .
If there is anything f un or sp e c i al , I will de f in ite ly let you o know because you are my s in se re listen er s .
I c ur r ent ly have f il led in the a p p l ic ation for m and c ur ri c ul um v it a e because it is need ed for job hu n ting .
The writing us ing P C is not all ow ed .
S e c on d ly , It is not er as able even if I make a mistake in writing .
So if I make am is ta ke , I must write again from the s c r at ch on a new paper .
I got the re s ul t of T O E I C to day .
It s c or ed 8 2 0 .
It ' s the be st s c or e for me .
But I do n ' t think that the s c or e re f le c t my c ur r ent English s k i ll .
A n y way this L an g 8 friend s help me b l us h up my English !
I went sh op p ing and I b ough t b ook .
I also eat ic e c re a m .
C ut a p p le s and w al n ut got into it .
L ot s of ar t ic le have written , If a man want to as k you out , you should say N O at least t w ic e , then say Y E S .
E s pe c i al for me , if you do n ' t say anything
So , P le a se , just as k anything as well .
The co a ch ' s a d v ic e were to watch a b a ll ce re ful i y and hi t the b a ll on c ent er of ra c ke t .
He a d v ic ed again that it was good for p r a c t ic e s w ing s a f e w minute s every day .
He also a d v ic ed me that it was good for p r a c t ic e to s s ing the b a ll on the ra c ke t .
He be l on g ed to a t able ten ic e c la b and he went there two time s a week .
He said that ten n is and t able ten n is are same .
He re c o m m en d ed me to start the t able ten n is .
You know , it is very difficult for J a p an e se to pro no un ce `` R `` and `` L `` sound s c or re c t ly .
I know how to pro no un ce R and L sound s .
But , when it come s to `` p l ate `` , I pro no un c ed it `` p r ate `` .
But , when I pro no un ce it very quick ly , I pro no un c ed it `` p r ate `` .
I have to give a present ation on my gradua te school ex pe ri ence for the new fresh man to day .
I do n ' t have n er v ous but I want to finish it e ar ly because I will have l ot s of work .
I want to do my be st in any case .
I s J a p an e se l i ar ? ( in English )
F or ex amp le , saying `` S e e you soon `` de s p ite not see ing after time , saying `` You speak J a p an e se very well ! `` when he ar ing only a f e w w or d s . . .
F or we J a p an e se the se are the un in ten tion al a ction s or are the a ction s we want to co m m un ic ate with other pe as on s m o o th ly though it see m s to be lie s if we change our view .
I laugh ed the ex amp le that there is no me l on in M E L O N P A N in J a p an ( ~ _ ~ ; )
( In J a p an there ' s the b re ad called M E L O N P A N ( me l on - b re ad ) but there is no me l on in it )
E ver y on e , do you have the moment that you feel J a p an e se is l i ar ?
Why do I like sweet s very much ?
I at e a ti r a m is u and a c he e se c a ke to day ! !
I like sweet s better than di e t s .
Yes ter day night I at ten d ed teacher - p ar ent con f er ence , in the con f er ence most of p ar ent s were talk ing about their
ch il d re n ' s a c ad e m ic perform ance , they think that if their ch il d re n have l ow gra d e , they will los e face .
They only care for t est s c or e , not le ar n ing pro ce s s .
In my opinion , t est s c or e is just an in s pe ction to ch il d re n ' s for m er le ar n ing .
P ar ent s should more care for their le ar n ing pro ce s s and le ar n ing me th o d , and help them over c ome difficult ies in their le ar n ing .
What is he al th y life ?
But now it has been change d a l ot .
I do n ' t read b ook s almost , and put meeting off with the ex c us e that I had too much works to do .
To day a friend here on la ng - 8 who come from U S A c or re c ted my ent ry , and he said he was in comp ut er la b , and would re p ly me the next time or next week .
To m or r ow is another day , I live in to day , everything in my mind is happen d yesterday .
I C an say C ant on e se well .
To m or r ow I will go to A u c k l and Z o o . . . .
I got to know this we b s ite from a b ook , which tell s me how to im p ro ve my English us ing i P ad .
I ho pe I can keep writing di ar y in English here .
The b a se b a ll tea m D o d g er s is coming to T a i w an .
I ' m so ex c it ing to see the b a se b a ll game in T a i w an ! !
The cause of it may be an im p ro ve ment of my writing s k i ll s , but I am not still con v in c ed per f e c t ly .
Why I ' m feel ing that speak ing is the w or st of my English s k i ll s at the moment , even though I us ed to feel speak ing was the be st .
They sit around my t able and they become my con ver s ation al part n er s at that day .
I think my c he er ful person al ity will cause good re s ul t .
The other a d v ant age is the ex is t ence of con ver s ation al part n er s in front of me .
And also , speak ing is a two - way and re al - time co m m un ic ation , so we can con f ir m the mean ing each other .
In other w or d s , there is no im m ed i ate way to know how much people understand what I w ro te .
In addition to the a d v ant age and dis ad v ant age between the ty pe s of co m m un ic ation , there is a limit ation of my English le ve l .
I re ally ha te that some on e mi s un d er st and s me .
That ' s why I did n ' t like writing something in English .
And The D a i i ch i p l ant has 6 n u c le ar p ow er st ation s .
A ll st ation s are sh ut down and es pe c i ally the 3 out of 6 are da ng er ous .
This U R L is the e le c t or ic comp an y ' s p re s s re le a se written in English .
I ho pe this U R L will help the people who c a n ' t read J a p an e se .
I ' m afraid of four u ture !
We were think ing they were f i ction , but we must be the se come tru e in the near future .
It ' s good ?

S in ce I bo c ame b or ed A m er ic an f o o d s , it was very good .

I also would l o ve to W al - M ar t in F l or id a again and bu y some more D V D s .
My pai n ting teacher , S and D o is a V i e t n ame se .
While tak ing his class , he told me how he has m aster ed English .
He also watch ed a bu n ch of mo v ies in English and m aster ed English .
W at ch ing mo v ies is one of the be st and the interest ing way s .
U n t i ll I will come back here next time , I re ally would like to im p ro ve my comp re h en s ion s k i ll s more ; I would like to become able to co m m un ic ate with my A m er ic an friend s much more .

I ho pe you can sha re your ex pe ri ence with me : )
My p ar ent s came to T an z an i a to me e t me for 1 month s ch ed ul e .

Some of them are C h id or i - ga - hu ch in the p al a ce , U en o - p ar k for ex amp le .

She does n ' t s k i p b re a k f a st every morning for my family .
when I was a st ud ent , I re ally do n ' t want to eat b re a k f a st she made every morning .
so , now I can understand how hard she tri ed to do for my family .
any way !
I feel ha p p y when ever think ing of the up c o m ing L un ar N e w year ' s D a y w i h t my family .
after the new year , I will start a di e t . . . . . . . .
can I ?
R es ent ly , I have been study ing for 3 or 4 hour s a day , but R e ad ing and L is ten ing were ma in ly large part .
S pe a k ing and writing w ar e less , part ic ul ally , just before To e ic .
To be honest , study ing to get high s c or e was not interest h ing moment for me .
I wish I could write di ar y every day .

No w , I ' m on va c ation s .
What I did - and was re ally n ic e - , was going to a r ock conc er t from a l o c al b and .
H o pe every on e is having f un on s um m er !
I have a question
I ' m le ar n ing e ng l ish now , but my e ng l ish is very poor .
how can I im p ro ve my e ng l ish ? o h my go d !
W ri ting di ar y in English every day is hard for me .
I could not man age to make enough time for it .
If once we make a line of f o l d ing on the p at ter n , it can not be put away .
The line will never dis a p pe ar .
L a st week en d , it was a long off - day because last F ri day was M e m or i al D a y for de v ot ed people in w ar , such as de ce as ed p at ri ot s , so il d er s and office r s of ar m ed for ce s .
F or n ation al ho l i day and week en d , I had three days to do something .
On F ri day , it was a c le an day because my p ar ent s want ed to be c le an ed up w o o d en floor .
So a half day we c le an ed it up , my p ar ent s and I were ex ha ust ed .
I could n ' t anything but take a re la x .
L a st S at ur day , I felt down and I ' d like to go out for a walk so I went to H a e un d a e be a ch alone .
As you know , some t i e m s people do n ' t want to be to g e ther , just leave one s el f alone .
When I ar ri v ed there , there were so many people who enjoy ed with family , l o ver s and friend s .
I walk ed by myself along the be a ch and sat down s and to do think ing something and see ing sea view s .
And I j o in ed the p ri v ate co ver s ation c l u b for im p ro v ing English s k i ll .
E ver y S at ur day it he l d s in S e o m y e on .
B e c a us e it can be im p ro v ed my English speech s k i ll and it make s people to g e ther as well .
B ri e f ly let you know this c l u b , for five hour s people talk about s ever al to p ic s and small talk s .
It ' s no re st ri c t to j o in the c l u b , just en ro l the we b s ite and then you can j o in it every S at ur day .
On ce j o in ing this c l u b , I should n ' t go back home after finish ing the con ver s ation .
U s u ally people go dr in k ing so j u and be er light ly .
And something to play sp or t s , such as play ing po o l , b ow ling and s ing ing to Ka r a o ke .
S ame as usual , we went to play po o l after finish ing co ver s ation .
We agree d on co st for po o l .
but I play ed with her friend .
I do n ' t know why I be ha v ed .
I will write a di ar y of da i ly even t s and thought .
A l th ough my writing is a w k w ar d te x t at first , it should make pro g re s s every day .
I have been l o v ed read ing c ar t o on since I was a ch il d , es pe c i ally J a p an e se c ar t o on .
T h ough C h in e se c ar t o on have im p ro v ed a l ot , I still l o ve the style of J a p an e se c ar t o on .
The c ar t o on called `` R ur o un i K en s h in `` is an e ar ly and sp e c i al c ar t o on in my me m or y .
I do n ' t know how to express my feel ing about this comp le x express ion .
The c ar t o on called `` R ur o un i K en s h in M e m or ies `` is very good , it ' s w or th to watch ing .
Then I answered ' Yes , I understand .
I s it c or re c t ?
or I should answered ' Yes , I do .
when should I answered ' Yes , I do .
So I am so ha p p y , but I need to c ook by myself , I tri ed to do my be st , I b ough t many d um p ling , It ' s easy to c ook , I had eat en it two day , A fter no on I play b as ke t b a ll with my friend four hour s , I had a good week en d .

Yes I ' m afraid of bo m b ing in the U .

But I think it ' s im p or t ant to re al i z e that we ten d to worry too much about ri s k s next to us , and ten d to i g no re them see m s to be far from us .
F or ex amp le , S w in e f l u has k il led 1 7 0 0 0 people in the U .
I gue s s it will do k i ll more or less people again .
C an you be ma k ing too much of this is s u e right now ?
S t ock ma s k s in case , f o o d and water and c he c k C D C every day ?
A no ther ex amp le , c ar a c c id ent s k i ll about 4 0 0 0 0 people every year , who can give up dr i v ing ?
Yes , we can con t ro l ri s k s and our mind s .
However , once we tra p p ed f e ar s of small at ta c k s might be happen at Y O U R c ity , `` ter r or `` can easily over - con t ro l our mind .
That make us d um b then we c a n ' t answer c or re c t ly the se kind of question s , `` which is more serious ? `` , `` which can k i ll many ? ``
But right i nformation that we ten d to do so will help us to over ta ke the effect s from f e ar s .
F in an c i al c ri s is make s us easy to l o o se our te m p er , so that ' s the reason I ho pe to sha re this with you .
I feel n u e v ous a little b it . . .

The di f f er ence of the s m o k ing ra te s between ma le and f e m al e in J a p an is much wide r than that in other co un t ri es s ur ve y ed .

I like s n ow ing day very much .
I like to see the s n ow f l ow er da n c ing in the a ir and s l ow ing down to the gr ound .
I str e t ch ed my p al m to wait the s n ow da n c ing to it and se i z ed them to my mouth , of c ur se I would put a p r un e to g e ther , ta st ing the favor s of s al t , so ur and sweet .
And then you could see w h ite s n ow full in every where , c le an ing and b ri g h t .
I still could re m en b er the first time I enjoy ed the so n w ing .
When my class m ate s and I de c id ed to s u f f er our sleep ing all night to c ri m b to the to p of S e ve n - S t ar M o un tain , we put on the he a v y c l o th ing all we had .
When we went out our a p ar t ment , there were c r ow d s p ar ad in full y on the ro ad .
We j o in ed to the c r ow d s and laugh ted our s el ve s c r a z y guy s .

S in ce now a day s I study writing English on this p age and I could speak better than before .
I s u o se that writing English is am o st the same as speak ing .
I got a little sat ic e f ic ed with that .
I ' st ud ing English by w a b less on with the p h i ri p p in e teacher .
They are kind very much .
The we b less on is us e ful l and f un for me .

H i , My name is y u .
I had st ud i ed in s el f - study unti l now .
most ly , I had st ud i ed in the train when I had co m m ut ed to my office .
But I thought it s difficult to m aster the English con ver s ation and writing English not e on that way .
R e c ent ly , the M T R has a short f il m comp e t i tion .
U s ing `` 1 0 3 `` as a to p ic to make f il m s .
No matter you are you ng or old .
T ry to do something sp e c i al to make your life ha p p i er is more im p or t ant .
just a way to explain we are the be st of our own .
B us y ing live !
I feel that much things must finish , for ex amp le : my home w or k , my pro g r a m , and so on .
We have some course but I do n ' t want to on class because other s thing see m like more im p or t ant than it and my course is not interest ing .
A l th ough I always go to class , I read my b ook and did n ' t listen ing my teacher ' s said .
R e c ent ly , some class m ate s had co l d so they did n ' t went to class .
I us ed to run but have not enough time s to run now .
F or t un ate , I have a good body so can do much things however I feel to ti re in this per i o d .
B us y ing live but it is ha p p y !
I dr in k much water and bu y 1 . 5 l it er bo t t led V o l v ic every day on my w at to office .
They are so good to me even though they ' ve had t ough time for some reason .
I was c ry ing when I hu g g ed his mother to say good by e .
They were very de l ic i ous .
I am writing to as k you about the p l an that you are going to bu il d a sh op p ing c ent er near the p ar k .
I knew the p l an to day from read ing the new s p a p er which you were explain ing the p l an at an in ter v i e w .
I am also afraid how the en v ir on ment of this are a will be , such as tra f f ic and no is e po ll u tion .
I would like to know the de ta il of the p l an .
U n less you do so and I agree the idea , I can not we l c ome the sh op p ing c ent er .
I would be very gr ate ful if you re p l i ed me in ten days .
J a p an e se c l im ate is original ly very hu m id , but in this sea s on , it become s more ter ri ble !
I w an n a go some where who se we a ther is clear .
I started to write a di ar y in la ng - 8 , but the number of c or re c ted time s is only one time s . . .
I s there any trick in or d er to be c or re c ted by some on e well ?
It would had better that I get in a p re m i um me m b er . . .
My un c le has 39 year s old .
I thought that it is only other person .
And we went to in w ed d ing place .

We t est im on i ed the ex t re m e ly strong affect ion between the teacher and the little girl , we sen d our be st wish es to the great teacher .
The picture is the last scene .
I l o ve the dance !
It was my honor to take the part ic i p ate in the perform ance , and I made friend s with every act or s of the dance , includ ing the little g ir , the teacher and the other a ng el s .
He is a f a m ous J a p an e se b a se b a ll play er and is c ur r ent ly a me m b er of S e at t le M ar in er s .
When it come s to the past a d m ir able f a m ous person , I think of M o ther T er es a .
She de d ic at ed her s el f to help ing the people who was poor or sick .
He r who le life de f in ite ly can tell the sign if ic ance of help ing other people to them .

That ' s the di f f er ence to / from / with ( ? ) me .
I turn ed the ra d i o on and am listen ing to A F K N , a cha n n el for U S ar m y in Y on g s an .

T h ough I like my natural ha ir co l or , black , I want to attempt to d y e .
I did n ' t write any w or d s for quite a long time since I left here .
R e c ent ly I ent er a law f ir m and start my care er as a law y er .

C ur r ent ly there are more than 3 5 0 s ta f f s work in our f a c il ity and for me , it take s at least 2 days to comp le te pay ro ll c a c ul ation and re p or t sub mission every month .
There is an on - line H R s y s te m la un ch ed last year to f a c il it ate the pay ro ll pro ce s s , im p ro ve a c c ur a c y and s a ve time on ma s s da ta pro ce s s ing by up d at ing s y s te m the b as ic person n el i nformation , includ ing but not limit ed to s ta f f mo ve ment , salary a d j ust ment .
I am going to s a ve a b o ve in M ic ro s o f t w or d before po st ing .
To day , I went to l i b r ar y to study English .
On the way to it high school students were play ing b a se b a ll in st ad i um .
I was watch ing it for a while because they seemed to enjoy it .
T h an k s for mo m !
A ra d i o l o g ical do s age in Tokyo is as usual by me as ur e ment at 1 9 th .
But J a p an e se go ver n ment request ed not to for w ar d .
I can do only p r a y .
R o ll ing black o ut s for ce us s ta g n ate works .
To day , I me t a new s ta f f me m b er in our office .
How small her face is !
It ' s s i z e is about One - th ir d of mi ne . . .
I had a l un ch with her and co ll e a gue s of our de p ar t ment to we l c ome her .
She has to get us ed to her new job as soon as possible .
So I have to help her .
To m or r ow I will make a speech in the morning meeting .
No w , I will p re p ar e for it . .
G r and father ' s house ~
Yes ter day before , I went to my gr and f a ther ' s house to stay with my friend s .
F a ther ' s home is in Ka ng W on D o , sub ur b an .
And some time s ce ll p h on e does n ' t work because there are many mo un tain .
D es p ite a l it t el in c on ve n i ent , there is c le an a ir , water , and very beautiful s c en ar y .
We were had a good time .
But , the next day , we could n ' t go to home because there were too many ra in to go home , ro ad s to se o ul were block ed .
F or t un ate ly , we could go to home for stop ra in .
If good , we a ther , I wish go there again .
I re ally like a so ng `` S ing S ing `` the be st .
E m man u el le S e i g n er , an F re n ch act re s s , is le ad v o c al is t of the b and .
The reason why I b ough t this C D is only her voice .
I saw a mo v i e ti t led `` The D i v ing B e ll and the But ter f ly `` last week , the mo v i e future their so ng `` D o n ' t K is s M e G o o d b y e `` .
To day 1 46 th T O E I C was take n place and I took it .
I mar k ed all answer , but I do n ' t know what s c or e I will get .
F or the p re p ar ation , I ex er c is ed them and read gra m m ar b ook s , in s te ad of writing j o ur n al s .
I ' m not sure I can get some a c c ur a c y for gra m m ar and ga in my v o c a b ul ar y through the ex er c is e .
But I clear ly understand I need more sp e ed for read ing English .
When I asked some question s about this t est for my English teacher , he answered so f a st , so quick ly .
It was b it strange for me , because the se b ook s were written in J a p an e se and they were read ing J a p an e se more than English .
So , why not will they be able to be s u ce s s ful by read ing J a p an e se ?
But new s p a p er s in English have more ri ch re s o ur ce of v o c a b ul ar y .
There f or e , T O E I C is just a turn ing point .
I want to im p ro ve this s k i ll as possible as I can !
I ' m tired now , so I ' ll commen t for my past j o ur n al s .
T h an k you for c or re c ting my j o ur n al s , always .
There are many ch er ry b l o s s o m s
which is the s y m b o l of sp r ing in J a p an .
and I ho pe I could write better English .
I also ho pe to tea ch J a p an e se too .
C h at ting is difficult for people than they think .
A b ook in which ti p s of cha t ting is written is se ll ed very much in J a p an .
I ra re ly go to V an c o u ver , be c ous e it take s 4 hour s from my town .
So I ' m always bu s s y for sh op p ing , when I stay in there .
I de f in ite ly get a l ot of J a p an e se b ook s in `` B ook O f f `` .
I usual ly b ough t no ve l s and I like all kind s of it , for ex amp le I like mi s ter y , a d ve n ture , S .
S e ar ch ing b ook s is re ally ex c it ing . x D
I always enjoy look ing for it .
I am living in Tokyo J a p an .
But I do n ' t watch J a p an e se D or a m a or an im e .
S im il ar ly I do n ' t f a m il i ar with J R ock .
T al k ing about m us ic , I rather f a m il i ar with E ur o pe and A m er ic an m us ic .
My di ar y was commen ted a l ot !
It is difficult to study English comp o s i tion at s el f - education .
So L an g - 8 is very very great ! ! ! !
I do my be st to study English ! !
I write the di ar y in English for the first time .
I have been study ing English since the gra d e - school er .
However , it is not good at it .
I think that I work ed hard well .
I went for c ut my ha ir to the ha ir s al on yesterday .
I have 3 p h ot o s of R ing o S in a , and so I had request to the be a ut y ar t is t .
`` M a y you c ut my ha ir look like her ? `` .
He looked her p h ot o s in many time s , and he was c ut ting my ha ir .
H is s al on is small , but he has good te ch n ic .
And ha ir c ut finish ed , I saw my ha ir on the mi r r or .
I felt became light en ed with my heart and ha ir .
A bout 9 0 people are k il led .
Why he at ta c k ed in no c ent people ?
I do n ' t know what he thought .
C an people have a g un in No r way ?
If it were no g un , it would n ' t be happen ed ter ro ri st at ta c k .
I think g un s are not ne ce s s ar y .
In J a p an , me ta b or ic is big is s u e for a d ul th o o d .
O f course It ' s big is s u e for me .
U s u ally I go to g y m for keep ing good sha pe ,
but my we i g h t still re m a in s to be the same .
My friend a d v is ed me to run , do sit - up and a b d o m in al ex er c is e
So I started them right now .
I ' ve been ex er c is ing them in three days .
B y the next s um m er I ' d like to show my f ir m m us c le .
I try to cha ll e ng e many time s .
I was ma k ing the game and ma k ing the we b sit e .
There f or e , I like J a p an e se - man g a and v id e o game .
I like m us ic and go for a walk too .
I will play a v id e o game on x b o x to day .
And , I think that I go for a walk .
I want to write every day , but some time s I do n ' t know what to write , and other s , when I start to write I find difficult s because I do n ' t know how to say something and I do n ' t finish it .
I think I need to study more and to le ar n more v o c a b ul ar y .
I usual ly watch f il m s and s er ies in e ng l ish with sub t it le s .
No w I am watch ing L o st , and I think I could understand the most part without sub s .
I am tired , so I am going to dinner and watch one L o st e p is o d e before go to be d .
And , I have one question , what is it the di f f er ence between `` town `` and `` c ity `` ?
I have been a little bu s y and I have not written or c or re c ted much l ate ly .
I just started L an g - 8 , So I want to st ud ing English and F re n ch .
I look for w ar d to ex pe ri ence in L an g - 8 !
S e e You N e x t Y e ar !
My F l or id i an friend return ed to his country .
I re ally re ally mi s s him .
When I look at stuff that he had us ed in my house , I always re m e m b er him .
There are too many me m or ies in my house .
When I see his gr e en s and al s that he left in my house , I start to want to c ry to re m e m b er him .
It ' s re ally t ough for me to stand c ry ing .
In two month s I had great time with him .
I would l o ve to say him than k you so much from the bo t t o m of my heart .
I like sha re with they my live .
No w , I and they by QQ on line cha t .
I ho pe in L an g - 8 I make more friend s .
Some person s has go ne to other se ction and some on e has come to my for m er se ction .
I am the one of the person who has go ne .
However people still in the se ction are talk ing about me and sen d me a e - ma il .
I than k to all of my for m er co ll e a gue s .
I was and am now s up p or ted by a l ot of people .
I want to make an an im ation a f e w di al o gue .
I want to make an im ation a f e w di al o gue , because I want to make world - class pro d u ction s .
I know it ' s difficult to do , but I keep try ing it .
I read an ar t ic le on a new s p a p er about the J a p an e se e c on o m y two days a g o .
As you already know , J a p an became the s up er a g ing so c i e ty , old people who will re t i re a f e w year s la ter are very de s p er ate to pro te c t their position s in their own comp an ies .
F or old people , you ng job a p p l ic ant s and work er s are just n u is ance , because If you ng work er s ent er a comp an y , the comp an y may f i re old work er s who have been tak ing good pay ment s for a long time .
O l d work er s are afraid of it .
So some time s old work er s bu l ly you ng work er s unti l new work er s quite .
O l d people always da re to give us us e less le c ture s , like `` C on te m p or ar y you ng people do n ' t make effort s at all `` and `` They want to get only high stand ar d job s , there are many job s they can do , even though pay ment s are not good , why are their idea l so high ? `` M a y b e they have never read job a d ver t is e ment s at all .
They do n ' t have di c k s and b ow l s .
T h an k you for your a d v ic e for my P C .
I have n ' t in ve st i g at ed my P C close ly yet .
It end s up on the back - b ur n er .
It might be the same as some people po st po ne going to the ho s p it al when they do n ' t feel well because of bu s y ness .
On my previous ent ry , I asked about `` to per s u ad e `` and `` to con v in ce . ``
T h an k s to all of your explanation s , I understood well the di f f er ence .
So we need to w in our bo s s over in another way .
I will take an English less on at T ur ry ' s co f f e e , to day .
It is 2 time s .
I do n ' t us e te x t b ook and di ction ar y .
We talk about anything to p ic s .
I found the teacher from we b s ite that is `` my sen se i .
My teacher is lady , she is 2 8 year s old .
She is n ic e for me .
But , it s co st is 4 8 0 0 per 1 hour .
W ow , I have to draw money from a b an k ! ! ! !
I go n n a go !
E g o and other person
I said to him `` can I help you ? `` or `` what are you look ing for ? ``
A t we l c ome part y , he said to me that he was surprise d to be give n a hand by me .
I am not sure that I comp le te ly understood what he told to , but I would like to s um m ar i z ed what he said .
They va l u e the a ut on o m y .
They do not give a hand to other person without one ' s de m and .
They think that he does not need to help when he say s anything .
The se are co m m on think ing in J a p an .
I took care of him with a J a p an e se way .
That was a c ul ture sh ock .
It has been a long time since I became un c er tain of the or ch est r a con d u c ting , but to day I le ar n ed something .
M a y b e it can be a b re a k th r ough .
T an g led th re ad in my head may be un r a ve led .
I found I was ex cited in the train back to Tokyo .
W he ther I can get hold of it or not depend s on how I sp en d every day .
When I w o ke up , I comp le te ly feel good .
I think it ' s because of going to be d e ar ly .
We went there for help ing my p ar ent s ' work .
It was a little b it hard work though , we enjoy ed help ing them out .
I gue s s I can sleep ti g h t to night and feel better and better tomorrow .
Yes ter day I don at ed my b l o o d , ho p ing my b l o o d c an s a ve some on e ' s life , for the first year in 2 0 1 1 .
J a p an e se C on st it u tion all ow any on e who se age is over 1 6 to don ate b l o o d of 2 0 0 c c .
I will give surprise to her at the C h ri st m as .
last night our teacher talk ed about the dr e a m of re d man s i tion with us .
this no ve l was one of the most f a m ous no ve l s written by C a o X u e Q in who live d in Q in D y n as ty .
this no ve l now has s ever al ver s ion s .
but I think the first ver s ion is the most p op ul ar .
re c ent y , another direct or make another ver s ion .
This one like a night m ar e .
make up and m us ic are very ho r ri ble like a g h o st f il m .
the act or and act re e are very you ng so they do n ' t know how to perform this t v show .
the di al o gue almost re pe at from the no ve l .
there are many voice o ver through t o ut the t v show .
I need to p re p ar e the ex a m re la ted to my work which I ' m going to take next week .
I also want to take more time for le ar n ing English , but I c a n ' t man age to do both of them .
I wish I could be a little better to do m ul t i p le ta s k s .
dr i v ing school s gradua ted last week .
I want to take a l ic en s soon !
I m interest ed in j a p an and k or e an c ul ture .
I l o ve an im es and man g as .
I think J a p an should f o c us more on re l ation s with other n ation s because there are s ever al reason s why I think so .
S e c on d ly , in As i an n ation s , J a p an is the only a d v ance d n ation so J a p an should show other n ation s about how to de al with in ter n ation a re l ation s with E ur o pe an n ation s and the United States .
J a p an e se people have been work ing hard and po l it ic i an s and di p l o m at s have been ma k ing good re l ation s with United S ta ted and E ur o pe an n ation s .
One was J a p an should f o c us more on re l ation s with other As i an n ation s because J a p an should take a ro le as a le ad ing n ation in As i an co un t ir es .
The other reason was J a p an know s a l ot about re l ation s with E ur o pe an n ation s and A m er ic a so we should us e the a d v ant age to co m m un ic ate and have a good re l ation with other n ation s .
My desk in the office is usual ly much ne at er than most of my co ll e a gue s .
However a l ot of hard c op y do c u ment s have been p il ed up on my desk and the draw er has been full of them re c ent ly .
I de c id ed to take some time and to c he c k the do c u ment s whether they were re ally ne ce s s ar y for me or not .
To my surprise , the re s ul t was that I could re d u ce them to one f if th .
If you have some trouble in your work , I re c o m m en d that you should c le an your desk .
I do not understand how to re m e m b er English .
F ir st of all , I want to speak an easy da i ly con ver s ation .
F ro m what should I start study ing ?
I went to C h er ry B l o s s o m s with my w if e last s un day .
We b ough t the co f f e e and the c a ke .
We enjoy eat ing c a ke and co f f e e under the C h er ry B l o s s o m s at the ri ver side .
E ver y on e enjoy c ook ing B B Q and p a ly ing l ite sp or t s .
I had re la x time .
came the bra n ch
To day is ho l i day and It ' s a n ic e we a ther .
If I have p al an s , I think I go to some where . but . . . . . ! !
I did n ' t have p l an s to day . so , I w o ke up at 1 1 : 0 0 . and then I at e l un ch and watch ed D V D and play ed u ku le le .
If It ' s n ic e day tomorrow , I will go to some where !
What a both er .
That re m a in s me , I have to finish my home w or k by the day after next .
P le a se tea ch this reason in de ta il .
I found that I ' ve been written my j o ur n al in English around for 7 0 days .
I want to express my idea or my feel ing in English more and more .
B e f or e writing a j o ur n al , I did n ' t pay at ten tion no un s .
T h ough there are two kind s of no un s ( one is co un t able no un , the other is un c o un t able no un ) in English , we do n ' t have such idea s in J a p an e se .
I es pe c i ally do n ' t understand about a b st r a c t no un s .
On the other hand , I ten d to think how I express J a p an e se p h r a se in English every day .
F or ex amp le , while I talk with my friend , I think how I express this feel ing in English .
Then , when I talk with my English teacher , I of ten re p l i ed with two or three w or d s before , but I t ent to be able to re p ly comp le te ly sen t ence which I made , even though my comp le te ly sen t ence s are wrong most of case s .
However , if I keep p r a c t ic ing the se things , I will be able to m aster English some day .
There f or e , I think keep ing a di ar y is one of the be st way indeed
I keep on j o g g ing of an hour almost every night for three month s .
T h ough C h ri st op h er re c o m m en d ed run n ing us ing l ow - c us h ion sh o es in this b ook , I think there is a ri s k to hu r t a f o ot for begin n er s .
A c t u ally , I hu r t my feet us ing V i b r a m F ive F ing er s .
So , al th ough I do n ' t know I can run the who le dis t ance , I de c id ed to try a full mar a th on in A p ri l and ul t r a m ar a th on in J un e .
The tree - p l ant ing ce re m on y was he l d near my place .
It was a very big ce re m on y there .
It was because the E m p er or and E m p re s s came to p l ant tree s by themselves .
There are many ro ad s had been re p a ir ed , re - p a v ed or new ly made around and to w ar d s the p ar k where the ce re m on y was he l d for the ce re m on y in a d v ance .
The E m p er or and E m p re s s so w ed some see d s and p l ant ed by hand some see d ling s of tree s includ ing po ll en - less c ed ar s .
It was p ity that it ra in ed all the time d ur ing the ce re m on y , but many other at t r a ction s were there , that was some dance s , read ing some es s a y s , e t c .
We wish the tree s will gr ow up he al th i ly and we will could keep the beautiful mo un tain and nature .
This is my first di ar y .
I got to g e ther with my friend s to have O K O N O M I Y A K I part y to day .
O k on o m i y a k i , which look s like a p an c a ke , is a kind of l o c al f o o d in J a p an .
We enjoy ed eat ing them with talk ing .
In a d i tion , we watch ed J U D O game in o ly m p ic .
It was p ity that J a p an e se play er could n ' t w in a first prais e .
E a ch country ' s n ation al de b t b re ed s dis t r ust of world e c on o m y after the c ri s is in G re e k .
A fter L e h man ' s f a ll , the g l o b al de p re s s ion has ne ce s s it ate s f is c al a ction , so it see m s to be natural that the de b t s are gr ow ing large .
In addition , J a p an keep s c ur r ent - account s ur p l us , so J a p an might be consider ed to be re l at ive ly st able .
With o ut good pro s pe c t for ra p id im p ro ve ment of each country ' s c ur r ent account , the c ri s is of de f a ul t see m s to get more serious , and I think the c r u c i al per i o d is yet to come .
I l o g ed in this sit e L an g - 8 first time .
B e c a us e English t ut or ga ve me this U R L .
I will try write my di ar y in English from to day . . . !
`` You will go far a place where you do n ' t know where is no r how long is for .
You can take five an im al s to there .
but you c a n ' t take all an im al s all the way .
You have to leave a an im al on the way .
When you go a short , you ' ll have to leave a an im al again .
What an im al will you leave 1 st ?
What about 2 n d , 3 r d , 4 th ?
What about last one ?
D id you de c id ed ?
The far place mean s your life .
E a ch an im al have a mean in the follow ing .
What an im al did you leave 1 st ?

P le a se think about your de c is ion s with your reason s .
# This is the t est I ' ve heard to day .
I ho pe you can get through , al th ough my English is poor . . .
I here re c ent ly and con se qu ent ly do not know many English w or d s .
The d ent is t at ta ch ed me me t al f it ting s .
He said I will have a te e th a ch e a f e w hour s la ter , and I c a n ' t eat b re a k f a st next morning because of a pai n .
What is a s ad d est thing for me is not being able to eat ri ce c a ke s .
I stand it for two year s !
I ' m sleep y in it also this morning .
It ra in s from the we a ther of re c ent J a p an of saying , `` G u er ri ll a down po ur `` .
We he l d a dinner after that .
I enjoy ed it but my body pai n s me now !
I was sh or k ed with how many de ta il es I have to understand and me m or i z e .
M a y b e I got the p re m on i tion that I could pass or f a il ed this ex a m by a very small mar g in .
If I have time to comp la in about how difficult this is , I ' d better to sp en d the time read ing one more p age .
It ' s so bu s y a day .
I ra re ly have time to write something .

F ro m the ra d i o , I le ar n ed a w or d `` in va in . `` l o l , h m m , I saw many people like us ing it .
I told a friend to come here for le ar n ing e ng l ish , She is hung ar y girl , I me t her in the last year at re d un ive r se ( f f 0 0 0 0 . co m ) which is a f l ash we b s ite that people can talk at it .

The se days the we a ther become co o l er than before .
The reason is the No r th is having a co l d at m o s p he re ( so we , people who live in the So u th can feel some co l d from the No r th - do n ' t know how to write this sen t ence ) and one more thing is it ' s the end of No ve m b er , it ' s near ly C h ri st m as .

P ar ent s should n t be see n their bad ha b it s or be ha v i or s by their ch il d re n .
This is because ch il d re n ten d to im it ate qu i k ly what is o c c ur ed in front of them .
If a p ar ent l it ter ed , their ch il d would think simpl y that it is n t w or se and ra p id ly he or she would im it ate the bad be ha v i or .
this is bad .
Besides , once ch il d re n f a ll into a bad ha b it it is difficult to get out of it .

My name is l o v .
S t i ll I c a n ' t write English very well , so if you have a free time , please tea ch me my mistake in my di ar y .
' In un d ate ' is the water at ta c k .
J ust ten year s a g o in 1 99 8 , it was am id the year s called la ter `` L o st T en Y e ar s `` .
In the s um m er of the year , p ri m e mi n is ter K e i z o O b u ch i , who had just in a u g ur at ed , perform ed in front of a f r u it and ve g e t able st or e .
I think many can re m e m b er that .
The cha in re a ction of f al ling st ock p ri ce s ra id ed again at the world mar ke t , while we thought it was put an end to .
The p ri ce s in Tokyo mar ke t were the second high est ra te of de c line in the w a ke of the p l un g e in N e w Y or k .
A ccord ing to the est im ation of a p ri v ate re se ar ch in st it ut e , the va l u e of in d i v is u al sha re s and in ve st ment tru st f un d s had go ne down by about 1 0 0 tri ll ion yen between the end of J un e last year and the end of S ept e m b er this year .
It is too me r c i less for the people who have in ve st ed the s aving s and the all ow ance for re t i re ment for their po st - re t i re ment year s .
A ccord ing to st ock tra d er s , the p l un g e in N e w Y or k mar ke t last week is because of the an x i e ty about U . S .
f in ance s y s te m , but that of this week is because of the clear er ten d en c y of the re ce s s ion .
If the act u al e c on o m y in U . S .
is re ally a g g r a v at ed , it is very s ever e for J a p an , which ma in ly depend s on ex p or t s .
T h ough there is a b ri e f re c o ver y from `` L o st T en Y e ar s `` , it is said that e c on o m y in J a p an is also at the st age of re ce s s ion .
I he ar go ver n ment and the part ies in p ow er have be g un to study the a d d ing e c on o m ic po l ic ies .
P e op le want effect ive po l ic ies not l i p s er v ic es .
I think re al a ut um n has come at last .
When I read this b ook , I thought that my bo c a b r ar y of English is r ow re ve l .
I re pe ate l ly con s ul ted an English - J a p an e se di ction ar y .
This b ook ' s picture is very pretty .
I enjoy ed read ing this b ook , but I thought that want to study English very hard .
On ce you us e a M a c you can not go back to W in d ow s P C s , because M a c is us e ful , s m ar t and so co o l .
A tru c k p ad on the la p t op ty pe of M a c re c o g n i z es the number of your f ing er s on it .
If you have an i P h on e I strong ly re c o m m en d you bu y a M a c .
This was because an even was he l d there .
My first j o ur n al in L an g - 8
But there is no time to us e my English in da ir y life .
So , in L an g - 8 , I want to co m m un ic ate with n at ive English speak er s and im p ro ve my English s k i ll s ! !
I can tea ch you my n at ive la g u age , J a p an e se too !
I ho pe I have time to me e t va ri ous kind of people here in L an g - 8 .
A ccord ing to my ex pe ri ence , ra in y sea s on might end before the middle of J u ly . . .
I ho pe it will end before the 3 days week - end s !
What will I been do ing in the ho l i day s ?
I have to think about it : )
No w , I ' m eat ing sp a g he t t i for my dinner .
This is c ook ed by myself .
I bo il ed noodle s for six minute s .
N e x t , I mi x ed noodle s and t un a ,
As a finish , I po ur ed so y s o ur ce over noodle s and d ust ed a piece of dr i ed bo n it o .
`` J a p an e se noodle `` has been comp le te ly ! !
It ' s very de ri c i ous .
As I commen ted on a di ar y M ar ch 2 7 th , a ma g a z in e re p or ter and a p h ot o g r a p h er came to our g y m and got a story .
F in ally I b ough t the ma g a z in e to day !
P le a se come to my J a p an e se b l o g if you have an interest in K en d o , m us ic and J a p an e se life .
To day we went to c ity ha ll ( in d ust i al c ul t ur al c ent er ) for no m in at ed en v ir on ment al e c o l o g y .
We are e c o g c al family ! ?
I could not believe .
But to day was ex cited and enjoy ed .
I ' m a so f t spoke n person , and some time s people c a n ' t he ar me es pe c i ally in no is y place s .
There are ti p s and a d v ic es for people who have the same pro ble m ( as mi ne / like mi ne / with me ) < - which one is c or re c t or more natural ? .
S m o ke a pack of c i g ar e t te every day , y e ll all the time . . . .
Yes ter day , I went to a No r a e b an g ( a room for s ing ing in S .
K or e a , little different from k ar a o ke in J a p an ) to feel better .
The se days , I have been de p re s s ed a b it .
My English does n ' t see m to get better es pe c i ally in speak ing , and also felt bad when my favor ite e ng l ish teacher kept saying like ' I c a n ' t he ar you . ' last class .
When I s an g so ng s there , I re al i z ed that my voice is not quiet ( b as ic ally / natural ly ) , just I talk ed usual ly quiet .
I will try to speak loud as much as possible .
I may feel like I ' m y el ling , but I also not ic ed that it t is not when I re c or d ed and heard my voice .
I ho pe you enjoy good f o o d and have f un in T h an k s g i v ing D a y !
In my sp ar e time , I of ten hi re some co m ic f il m s , not only the new and also the old class ic mo v ies .
E s pe c i ally when I en c o ut er a s ad or un ha p p y thing , I would like to watch a co m ic mo v i e .
And then I would for g e t those an no y ance s , and get a please d mo o d .
We watch come d y not just get f un from it , but also we can get some life p h il o s op h y .
There is much we can le ar n from him , not only his mo v ies , but also the person himself .
I have been do ing work ex a c t ly for 1 year unti l now .
To u ch ed work ing I have dis c o ver ed a f e w dis ad v ant age s myself .
In fact , I ' m we a k that I got some mistake s of pro ce s se s at work and I felt a b it un ha p p y that time .
A c t u ally I care so many things of my work .
I do n ' t know why am I care this so ?
We a k and sen s it ive I did n ' t know the se dis ad v ant age s when I was a st ud ent .
B y the way , it ' s very different between the part time and the full time job , so I do n ' t have any p re s um p tion s at work any m or e .
E ver y op p or t un it ies for work ing are all good try and which one must be s u it able for each person .
It was ra in ing , so I went the near est st ation by c ar after I took my so n to kind er g ar ten .
( U s u ally , I go there by b ic y c le to ex er c is e . )
I had expect ed there would be only me in this less on , but another train e e was there .
She visit ed there from the next c ity that this less on was he l d .
It took about 4 0 minute s by limit ed express , a ccord ing to her .
B e f or e the less on begin s , we cha t ted away .
We talk ed about our back g r ound s .
She entered high school in A ust r al i a , gradua ted from the school and then entered co ll e g e there .
A fter she came back to J a p an , she work ed at a hotel .
There was once a time , I us ed to work as a hotel s ta f f . )
As for the less on , it was cha ll e ng ing , but re w ar d ing like last time .
; D We have to le ar n the teaching me th o d s in a short per i o d and do a l ot s of home w or k every time .
There ' re 2 4 hour s in a day . . . .
Well , I should n ' t ne g le c t my ro ut in e English study to b r us h up on my English s k i ll s .
I went to B e i j ing M us e um of N at ur al H is t or y to day and it was very ex c it ing .
A p p r ent ly , it is p op ul ar with kid s , but I think it is also a good place for a d ul t s to le ar n more about the mother nature .
S c i ent is t s found that in the last fifty year s of t w ent i e th c ent ur y , hu n d r ed s of th ous and s of sp e c ies had been ex t in c t on e ar th .
As a re s ul t , when s c i ent is t s are study ing the six ma s s ex t in ction s of or g an is m in natural history , they find s ur p ri s ing ly that the e ar th is ex pe ri en c ing the se ve n th ma s s ex t in ction of or g an is m right now .

The ex t in ction of mo d er n or g an is m s are d u e to hu man ' s act i v it ies .
H um an is the only sp e c ies that can re s ul t in the ma s s ex t in ction s of other sp e c ies in the history of life .
P e op le ' s e c on o m ic act i v it ies like the over - ex p l o it ing of for est and ex ce s s re c la m ation le ad to the cha ng ing of en v ion ment of other sp e c ies .
P o ll u tion from hu man act i v it ies end an g er the s ur v i v al of w il d live s .
B e c a us e of the p op ul ation ex p l o s ion , people are comp e ting with an im al s for re s o ur ce s , which also re s ul t s in the ex t in ction .
from yesterday , I go into the t est week s , I have to study for t est of my s c o o l .

He leave s for another job .
We , he and I , have been at the same gr o up for about five year s , since 2 0 0 5 .
He was a gr o up le ad er of our gr o up .
There f or e , I got sh ock ed and felt something be t r a y ed when I heard the new s of his change of job .
But this is also tru e that I respect him a l ot as a good e ng in e er and I like him as a good el d er friend .

In the end , she pro m ot ed and get a n ic e bo y friend in the mo v i e .

And le ar n ing new language s between you and me .

now I am p r a c t ic ing e ng l ish s ic n ce I go to A m er ic a next month .
I ' m very ex it ing but
w or r ing about if I can speak e ng l ish .
So I am p r a c t ic ing e ng l ish now .
I was told about this sit e my friend .
well , I go to A m er ic a with friend for one month .
On ce is my high school day .
Then , I was 1 7 year s old .
I stay ed ho st family with friend and had very good time .
I a p p re c i at ed my ho st family since had very good time and like to A m er ic a more and more .
This time , I want to go to ho st family and will tell about my life after that time .
any way I us e this sit e about for month and to a im at s k i ll up .
I am glad to that any on e c or re c t my di ar y .
It told me that I can us e this we b s ite to p r a c t ic e my writing .
I have n ' t written my da ir y for a long time .
S in ce I had a co l d I have n ' t got up e ar ly .
I get up at 6 in the morning re c ent ly .
To day I help people to get their things back .
It was on the t able where the people at e f o o d s .
Some on e for g ot it .
B e c a us e I can saw inside a b ook show the comp an y name .
I took it back to the b an k .
I am ha p p y that I help people to day .
To day , I went to the J o b S e ar ch C ent re with the do c u ment s .
I w o ke e ar ly and it was before my al ar m clock ra ng .
I re c ent ly w o ke in the middle of the night .
S in ce I w o ke e ar ly , I la y down again .
The C ent re is around ten minute s walk from the near est st ation .
There were some people wait ing their turn , so I p ic k ed off the re ce p tion she e t and wait ed my turn .
A fter I did re ce p tion I got an in t ro d u ction c ar d for my a p p l ic ation for a new job .
The job was a re ce p tion is t of a hotel in As a ku s a where far from my f l at .
I will receiv e a call whether they p l an a in ter v i e w with me .
They will make the de c is ion if they e m p l o y me .
I am old and have little care er s of good job .
So it is difficult to get new job but I can not l o o se ho pe .
I want to im p ro ve English writing .
I ' m st ud ent in the be i j ing .
but I want to le ar n about e ng l ish is very good .
because I go to study a b ro ad .
so , I ho pe that every on e help me e ng l ish .
I ' ve st ud i ed English so long and I can listen and understand what n at ive speak er s say .
But I have to a d m it I c a n ' t speak enough .
I want to re a ch the le ve l that I be able to make a good present ation in front of a ud i ence .
Some time s I become de s p er ate and feel that no body can a ch i e ve to re a ch that le ve l unless you live d in other co un t ri es when you were you ng .
But the idea was mistake .
I came to that conc l us ion when I see a present ation done by a p re s id ent of a comp an y .
He gradua ted from A m er ic an B us i ness school .
But he had n ' t been to U S before the business school .
He did a ex ce ll ent present at in about his ex p er t is e and his business .
He answered all the question with sen se of hu m or .
No w I believe I can be good e ng l ish present at or some day if I keep study ing .
C h op st ic k s are f a m ous As i an tra d i tion al too l to eat .
The are made of w o o d s .
S h o ul d not st ic k f o o d s .
I ' ve live d in J a p an since I was b or n , but it is difficult for me to p ic k up so small f o o d s as so y b e an .
I think it is ne ce s s ar y that I should more p r a c t ic e .
This new s us e e as i er English than `` a b c N E W S `` .
D o you know it ?
The se must have re f le c ted her feel ing s .
I ' m going to go to the Tokyo for A ll J a p an J H S ch or us comp e t i tion so I will leave my house e ar ly morning .
I will ar r ive no on and I will go N H K conc er t ha ll .
A fter A ll J a p an J H S ch or us comp e t i tion , I want to enjoy myself with my friend .
The question I of ten want to as k to a f o e i g n er
What cause a p es on leave his home t ow n and to a place which language even is di f f e ent ?
M an y answer s is to le ar n a new language .
But it must need any co ur age .
If your friend is going to a new country , what a d v ic e will you give to him o her ? like ex pe ri ence or some th ng else
I just became a me m b er of this sit e ,
I am to t ally new b i e like a - b a b y - de er - try ing - to - get - up - on - his - feet

P le a se c or re c t them if they are so wrong or better way to say .
I ho pe I would get us ed to this soon er . . .
but is it c or re c t ?
He re ' s an another question .
C h ri st m as day was over
No w C h ri st m as day was over and I feel re l i e f .
I got mar ri ed C an ad i an guy .
A n y way C h ri st m as day was over . . .
As you know , there are many e ar th qu a ke s in J a p an .
In the To h o ku re g ion , people are s u f f er ing from dis e a se , lack ing of f o o d and water , t s un a m i and so on .
However , I live in Ka n a g a w a per f e c ture , which is re m o te from To h o ku re g ion .
There f or e , I can s up p or t people in the re g ion only by f un d - ra is ing and p ow er s aving .
I feel my p ow er less ness .
So , I think they are also s u f f er ing .
I tri ed to get in to u ch with them over and over , but I could n ` t .
I ` m very w or ri ed about my re l at ive s .
As I can ` t get in to u ch with them , all I have to do is p r a y that they are al ive and he al th y .
We entered the big gra ve y ar d and the p it ch - dark t un n el at a time on a da re .
We walk ed s and y be a ch on the way .
I like the sea of night .
M o on and star s of the day were very beautiful .
M o on was b ri g h t , so it was n ' t in the dark .
So the t est of co ur age was n ' t s c ar e for me .
co s I re g is ter ed L an g - 8 just now .
I think this is re ally n ic e we b - sit e for le ar n ing language .
I want ed to find this more before .
by the way , some on e re ally will c or re c t my di ar y ?
To day , a f a m ous j a p an e se act re s s is place d on the want ed l is t .
He r name is `` No ri p i `` who are 3 8 year s old .
T w o days a g o , another one f a m ous e act or `` O s h i o man a b u `` is ar re st ed as a s us pe c ted person .
A l ot of people feel s ad about that and a part of one feel funny .
W h o catch her . . .
I c ar ry it with me at any time .
I look up a l ot of w or d s when I ' m on d ut y and study every day .
It always help me and it ' s a ne ce s s ity for me .
O h , it ' s a big pro ble m .
I suppose , I us ed it too much , or it has just re a ch ed it s life .
D o you know the co m ic ?
It is very f a m ous e in J a p an .
I play b as ke t b a ll , so I can feel sympath y with character s .
You c an enjoy it without a know led g e of b as ke t b a ll .
A f f e c ted by the out er b and of T y p h o on `` P ar m a `` , T a i w an had a l ot of ra in over the week en d .
It has been ra in ing 3 days in a r ow .
In s te ad of dr i z z le , it ' s to r r ent i al ra in .
The sound came from the ra in l ic k ing the e a ve s w a k ed me up in the middle of the night s ever al time s .
And the most im p or t ant fact is that my close s have not dr i ed yet .
I have to sub m it my p l an for the the s is by the end of M a y .
But I ' m still wonder ing what them e I should ch o o se .
I started this because I want to im p ro ve my ability of us ing English .
F ir st , I want to in t ro d u ce about myself .
I ' m a un ive r s ity st ud ent and I ' m ma j or ing in English and A m er ic an litera ture so I ' m interest ed in le ar n ing about other co un t ri es .
My dr e a m is to go to many co un t ri es and to talk with many people there .
My favor ite m us ic is i an s are N E W S , T e g o m as s , D e m i L o v at o and so on .
My favor ite mo v ies are H ar ry P ot ter , T w i light and so on .
I l o ve mo v ies so I ' m in a mo v i e ma k ing c l u b .
I am a st ud ent from C o l o m b i a and I try to le ar n English with this p age , can some on e help to this purpose ?
B e a u f y and the B e a st - C ha p ter one
On ce , There was ri ch me r ch ant in a big town .
The two el d er s is ter was u g ly and gr e ed y .
But , The you ng est d aught er was di f f er ence el d er s is ter s .
She was everything be a ut y .
But , B e a ut y than k ed about everything .
They family have to work .
So , He is going to the p or t .
But , the last sh i p was ro b b ed by p ir ate s .
2 0 1 0 . 1 1 . 5
I have got the job and started to work after the in ter v i e w .
I work with a ar t de s i g n er in an office .
He is a easy going person .
It is bu s y and I have to le ar n many things .
I also have to p r a c t ic e the de s i g n so f t w ar e `` I ll ust r at or `` more .
I work from am 1 0 : 0 0 to p m 5 : 0 0 , then I go to school after work .
I feel very tired and I can n ' t conc ent r ate on my b ook .
N e x t week we will start to the mi d - ter m ex a m .
And I s l s o wish to have more time to p r a c t ic e `` s al s a `` .
I ho pe everything can go s m o o th ly in the future .
To day , I watch ed a mo v i e `` O c t o b er s k y ``
The mo v i e ' s ma in act or is a bo y called ' home r ' .
The bo y b or n and raise d co al - mi n ing town .
He has a dr e a m , ( B e ing a r ock e t s c i ent is t . ) and in the end he did it .
The bo y ' s big g ies t str u g g l er is his father .
But home r ch o o se his life , not father ' s .
It ' s interest ing mo v i e .
A f e w days a g o , I watch ed `` F or re st G um p `` , the D V D of which I had b or r ow ed from a r ent al sh op .
I do n ' t de s c ri b e the de ta il s of this f il m , because if you have never watch ed it I want you to watch it .
I have take n a voice train ing less on since 2 0 0 9 .
I am be l on g to M ar ke ting di v is ion at work , so that I of ten make a present ation
for s al es pro m o tion of our pro d u c t s .
In J a p an , most people ten d to like high to ne voice , but I did n ' t have high voice .
I thought it is im p or t ant for an at t r a c t ive present ation to make a speech with clear voice .
That is why I started to take a train ing .
No w many a ud i ence s prais e my present ation .
I was to t ally th re w out when I got out from my last la b class on F ri day .
when my class was over I was cha t ting on F a ce b ook with my friend s ud d en ly one of the my class - me t came and started shout ing and c ry ing .
I sea r ch ed B B C new s it was un b el i e v able o h go d what you have done .
then I re le as ed that go d always c ur s ed on people .
if he did n ' t want the living s being s then why he c re at ed the se all this to see the this ty pe of even t s I to t ally a ng ry on the go d .
I know some people do bad things but some are help ful to other .
where is the go d I do n ' t believe he is so kind full for the c re a ture that he c re ate s .
o h h h go d I hu m b ly request you please stop this f e ar ful , dr e ad full things do n ' t c r us e your so n if you are re ally a go d .
A n y father will never want that his so n get trouble then why are you so un k in d ness .
if we make s some little mistake give some little punishment but people of j a p an are so kind ful and la b o ur ish you can t expect .
I felt myself to ga in gr ound v it al ity when I ex er c is ed to str e ng th en the a b d o m in al m us c le s .
J ust my sen se .
I wonder if my body would be straight .
I think there are many mistake s in gra m m er , I would a p p re c i ate it if you could point out my mistake .
I ' m comp le te ly b ro ke since I ar ri v ed J a p an .
I should n ' t have tra ve led in A ust r al i a with my friend if I want to s a ve some money but of course I could n ' t do that .
It ' s our first and could be last time to tra ve l there .
E ver y time never be the same , so I ch o se to us e money .
It ' s right de c is ion .
O ur tra ve l was so ex cited , sp e c i al time for us .
I us ed to work in a hotel in O s a k a before I go to A ust r al i a .
I want to us e English for my job .
I ' ll do my be st , please cross your f ing er for me ; )
If ch il d re n play out side and con ta c t many b a c ter i a , they might p re v ent all er g ic dis e a se .
F ur ther m or e , there are s ever al re p or t s that some f o o d includ ing b a c ter i a work well with our body .
F or ex amp le , y o g ur t includ ing la c t ic a c id b a c ter i a is believe d to make us he al th y and p re v ent dis e a se , because the se b a c ter i a str e ng th en the im m un e s y s te m .
However , it is still un c le ar how much the pro b i ot ic s affect the im m un e s y s te m and p re v ent dis e a se .
O ur en v ir on ment includ ing our body has already many b a c ter i a and we are ex po s ed by them all time .
The most of da ta as be ne f ic i al to our body are c la m ed by comp an ies pro d u c ing f er ment ed f o o d s .
There are re se ar ch con f l ic t s and we need much more study f a ir ly .
F ir st D i ar y

However , they may not feel easy unless they catch something in their sleep .
S e a ot ter s which live in a a qu ar i um some time s sleep hand in hand .
My w if e said that the b a b y in her inside did many hi c c up s yesterday .
It was for about one minute .
She said it is may b e for p r a c t ic e to b re a th after the b ir th .
How of ten do you do hi c c up s ?

O f course , I l o ve it .
Yes ter day I was do ing s k y pe to my sh o o l friend s .

The study of English works hard
H a ve you ever see n in you clock `` 1 2 : 1 2 `` ?
The people say s that see this kind of number s ( do u ble number s ) you will have good l u c k !
I do n ' t know if this is tru e or f al se because I saw that kind of number s at the time ! !
I f e ll very co l d .
I d ropped by b ook st or e after work to day .
I want ed to get fashion ma g a z in e but I re m e m b er ed that I for g at my p ur se .
I ' ll go to there again tomorrow .
And I s ta id a month at home st a y .
So I was very co m f or t able and I enjoy a for e i g n tri p .
I came K or e a and want ed to call them .
B e c a us I los t his e - ma il address .
But it im po se a little b ur d en on me .
I want be sure to te le p h on e them before more time pass es .
My friend mar ri ed ! !
My friend mar ri ed last M a y .
The friend is the same age as me ( 2 2 y e as old ) , so I was surprise d a little .
In J a p an , people re l at ive ly mar ri ed around 3 0 y e as old .
In your country , how old do people mar ry ?
I ga in ed we i g h t this year than last year . ( - - ; )
So , I de c id ed to c le an up the close t for my new pai n ting st ud i o in s um m er time .
A l th ough I do n ' t like c le an ing , after finish ed c le an ing up the k it ch en , I felt re fresh ed .
I can read ing .
So want to study here .
I ' m not like a g r a m m ar .
The di ction ar y is us ed , it may be wrong .
W on t ' you c or re c t my English comp o s i tion ?
My so n s and I went to J J c l u b .
we read some b ook s for an hour or so .
H ence I make it a r ul e to speak with myself about what happen ed to me on the day .
I ho pe I will be able to m aster it by this way .
The s ur f is the most im p or t ant in my life . . .
I l o ve s ur f but s ur f it s very s im i ll ar a dr u g s .
I s very a d d ic ted .
S ur f ing is good for tra ve ll ing a l ot of the world and sea r ch different be a ch es .
T h an k you for re p ly so soon .
E T S is the most e f f c i ent in st it u tion I have ever see n .
I de e p ly a p p re c i ate that you take my pro ble m as your conc er n .
But I still have one more question about the pro ce s s of cha ng ing my name .
My sit u ation is , I did n ' t know that I made a mistake on my name unti l the s ta f f of the t est c ent er told me , that is , they told me that just before the t est began .
So my question is :
`` I s the t est c ent er o b l i g at ed to re p or t it to E T S if they found there ' s in c on s is ten c y between the name of re g is t r ation and the pass p or t the st ud ent show ed ? ``
The reason why I as k this question is that I have some friend s they also made mistake s on their name , however , the s ta f f of the t est c ent er help them re p or t it to E T S .
Even t u ally , all of them c or re c ted their name success ful ly !
O k a y , let ' s get back to the question .
If the answer is `` Y E S `` , then I could as k for da m age s from the t est c ent er I took t est in .
B e c a us e of their ne g l i g ence , I sp ent 1 6 0 U S D and get nothing !
My T O E F L s c or e would be in v al id be c u a se that they did n ' t have my name c or re c t !
If the answer is `` N O `` , then I will c a st do u b t s on the re l i ance of E T S .
In other w or d s , any on e could re p la ce me to take this t est .
The s ta f f s of t est c ent er knew that there is a mistake on my name , but they still let me take the t est .
I am just a poor st ud ent who want to study a b ro ad .
I only e ar n 3 5 0 U S D per month , and the t est took me almost half of my salary .
A ll I want is a f a ir t est .
I know I make the first mistake , it ' s my fault .
But there are other s who made same mistake s then got re p a ir .
We have same pro ble m but end up with different con se qu ence .
T h an k you for your re p ly again ! !
R e ally a p p re c i ate .
S in ce re ly your s ,
In the mi d d l d of night I w o ke up by some ter ri ble sound .
J ust as was expect ed , the f l o o d ing and da m age new s was re p or ted in the morning .
J a p an 0 - 0 A ust r al i a in As i an C up f in al !
It ' s go n n a go into the ex t r a time !
B e at A ust r al i a , J a p an , p le e e e e e se !
B t w , why on e ar th there s no p i z z a de l ive ry at mi d night ?
first time us ing la ng - 8
hi every on e , this is my first time us ing la ng - 8 .
my friend say s it ' s re ally help ful .
so I w an n a try it : P I ' m not very sure how it works .
I w an n a le ar n ing for m al e ng l ish .
c z it ' s re ally a pro ble m for me .
I don t know the di f f er ence s .
would you please give me some ex amp le s ?
than k s !
I of ten have had night m ar es since b ro ke up .
There f or e , I am in a state of poor mind at work .
How long does this condition con t in u e ?
D a y before yesterday , and yesterday , I play ed in a b and .
I play ed that so ng was `` H E A V E N `` ( J an ne da ar c ) , `` G o d know s `` and `` E m p ty co l or days `` .
A fter I have read the ar t ic le about `` A re you ha p p y with life ? `` from the new s g ro up .
Then , I as k myself .
I do n ' t re ally know I am ha p p y or not .
Some time s , I would to like to want more and more pretty c l o th es even I have had much c l o th es already .
My mother always s c o l d me , `` Why are you bu y so much c l o th es , but could n ' t see me we ar ing the c l o th es ? `` He e he e , I do n ' t know why I just want to bu y it at that moment .
A fter I went home , I felt I have b ough t the wrong things and felt un s at is f i ed .
On the other hand , when my friend an no y ed me , I will feel a ng ry for a f e w days .
But , A fter a week , I will felt nothing at all .
So , every little things can make me ha p p y , and every little things can make me dis p re s s ed .
I do n ' t know how to re p ly this question .
To day I went to re st a ur ant with my family .
It was the last ch ance that we were all re st in this s um m er .
My father said Let ' s eat de l ic i ous l un ch !
We could eat anything for T h ous and Y en , but my father had 4 me al ti c ke t s , so we could eat free ! : D
There were a l ot of de l ic i ous f o o d s !
F or ex amp le , F re n ch c u is in e , C h in e se f o o d , J a p an e se f o o d , and de s s er t s ! !
I at e my f i ll heart i ly , but my family at e more .
My father and brother at e three time s as much as I do !
It ' s ra in y to day .
so I did speak ing s l ow ly .
I ' ll study English P ro n un c i ation hard er tomorrow .
R i ch co un t ri es of ten give f in an c i al a id to poor co un t ri es , but it does not so l ve the po ver ty , so ri ch co un t ies should give other ty pe s of help to the poor co un t ri es rather than the f in an c i al a id .
C ur r ent ly , it is not un c o m m on for ri ch co un t ies off er f in an c i al a id to the poor co un t ri es , for the s a ke of help ing them sha ke off po ver ty .
But the effort see m s not effect ive enough that many im po ver ish ed co un t ri es still s u f f er from po ver ty and other pro ble m s .
There f or e , which for m of a id should be off er ed to the poor co un t ri es has been a to p ic of dis c us s ion .
Some people are con v in c ed that we al th y co un t ri es should off er a id in al ter n at ive for m s such as education or te ch no l o g y in s te ad of str ic t ly f in an c i al s up p or t .
There is no do u b t that one country can not de ve l op to be a strong one while it always re ly ing on other co un t ri es help .
It is the de ve l op ment of education and te ch no l o g y that can re ally push one country to become a we al th y one .
When a country is so poor that it can not de ve l op it s own education and te ch no l o g y by it s el f , the as s is t s that serve d with education and te ch no l o g y from ri ch co un t ri es can make a great effort .
In d i a is a country which us ed to be so poor that can not a f f or d the hu g e do m est ic co st , but it become more p ow er ful than ever before d u e to the de ve l op ment of comp ut er te ch no l o g y , which is be ne f it from the te ch no l o g y a id s from de ve l op ed co un t ri es .
A p p ar ent ly , most poor co un t ri es re ly on direct f in an c i al s up p or t to re l i e ve p re s s ur es of po ver ty , which can us e in different way s to all e v i ate the po ver ty , such as bu y ing f o o d s for hung er s and bu y ing mi l it ar y e qu i p ment for the st ability of the country .
The c it i z en s of such co un t ri es will s u f f er from hung er and dis t ur b ance if f in an c i al a id is with d r a w n .
The ma in is s u e should be how the poor co un t ri es make good us e of the se a id s in a proper way to im p ro ve the well b e ing of the c it i z en s .
I just le ar n t a p h r a se `` To the co re . `` so I would like to make a sen t ence .
He change d a l ot to the co re .
It is very ha p p y .
But my salary is c ut 1 5 per c ent to e a se the comp an y f in an c i al c ri s is .
Then , my all ow ance is c ut 2 0 per c ent by my w if e .
I can not dr in k with my sub or d in ate .
I will bu y small c a k ies for my w if e ( family ) , and will ne g ot i ate the in ce a se my all ow ance .
I b ough t the b l u e - ra y / hard - dis k re c or d er on in st a ll ment last year , and keep pay ing a l o an from my all ow ance .
To day , My w if e will watch the T V pro g r a m ; S M A P - S M A P that was re c or d ed by my w if e at yesterday night .
P le a se in c re a se my all ow ance .
I am dr in k ing co f f e e and I a w o ke .
To day I go to study English in l i b r ar y .
I do my be st .
I ' m a J a p an se in H o k k a id o .
I ' m going to take an English l ic en se e on J un e . , so I study English more hard er ! !
My ho b b y is listen ing to m us ic , play ing the b as s , read ing b ook s , and more , but I like tra ve ling the be st of all .
I have been to J a p an ex c ept for O k in a w a .

However , every one who se mother to n gue are M and ar in will be able to re c o g n i z e C h in e se character s since they are 4 year s old .

B e f or e , I had been as k ing `` are you sign ing or just speak ing `` by a M a c ed on i a girl .
There f or e , some time s it ' s like sign ing .
A l ot of good an im ation s are made in many co un t ri es like R us s i a , C z e ch , and C an ad a .
A ll of them were f e m al e .
It was l u k y for our da ir y far m .
A fter T w o year s , they will pro d u c t mi l k for us .
There is a big b ook st or e in B 1 floor and B 2 floor of this bu il d ing .
C o c o on T ow er has very strange g en er al view .
W at ch it with G o o g le S t re e t V i e w at this ur l .
I heard that , in e m er g en c y up p er part of the bu il d ing open for l and ing of he l ic op ter .
B y the way , to day S as u ke ( N in j a something ) was been b ro ad c as ted .
A J a p an e se b l o g g er w ro te a ent ry about `` F or e i g n affair s re p or t `` , this is the most affect ive qu al ity paper in the world .

The se days I have much interest about in ter n ation al incident s .
However , it ' s too ex p en s ive for me to bu y . . . .
It co st s me 2 2 0 0 yen ( about 2 0 do ll or s ) , this is e qu al to my f o o d ex p ence for 1 week .
I ' m going to as k the un ive r s ity ' s l i b r ar y to bu y it !
But I do n ' t know my re al mind .
I mean I do n ' t know what to think about him .
I just feel like tak ing with him .
I just feel this , but
I do n ' t want to think this is l o ve .
My be st friend say s that girl s should be per s u e by bo y s other w is e
your heart might be hu r t by think ing own l o ver too much .
However I c a n ' t help r ing ing his p h on e though
he hard ly call me .
W h i ch is c or re c t ?
1 ) I sen t a e m a il to him .
But It does n ' t ma t ch such a thing .
As I us ed the d h i ction ar y , I knew that mean s `` That ' s right `` .
What I w an n a know , this express ion is ch il d i h or not ?
If a d ul t s us e this sen t ence , is that strange ?
I could n ' t con f id ent ly do him the favor as I know my English is b ro k en English .
However I did some h ow , but still in need of help .

Why no body c or re c t my di ar y

I ho pe I can get im p ro ve ment from you who le .
But now since no body c or re c t my comp o s i tion , I do n ' t know what mistake s I have had .
I ho pe you can read my di ar ies and give me a d v ic e .
I need to im p ro ve my English , any body , than k s .
M a y b e what I w ro te in v o l v ed something person al , but I ho pe you can c or re c t my mistake s most on express ion and so on about language .

B y the way , I took T O E F L last week en d .
I was re ally sh ock ed because my speak ing s k i ll has f al le n consider ably .
I re al i z ed it ' s im p or t ant to con t in u e p r a c t ic ing con ver s ation in a da i ly life .
I have di c id ed to try my be st to study English .
I will th r ow away my in f er i or ity comp le x to open my mouth .
B e c a us e I want to read or i g ion al ed i tion b ook s and tra n s l ate them .
I want those who read b ook s I have tra n s la ted to understand what have said in the b ook s .
I do n ' t think `` ha ir `` is a co un t able no un when you say about the who le part on your head , so it c a n ' t be `` a ha ir `` . . .
It ' s re ally hot and hu m id now at Tokyo , and I could not end ur e this he at and hu m id ity with my ha ir which was pretty long for guy s .
A l s o I did n ' t go for a ha ir c ut for long time , so my ha ir was quite long er than usual .
Well , it ' ll be e as i er to over c ome this s um m er with this ha ir : )
A two - year s - old b a b y sh ot his mother to de a th un p ur po se ly in A m er ic a .
It is a so r r ow .

What he get s from hard work can only make for his da i ly ne ce s s it ies .
They never as k anything more in their live s .
A week s a g o , he was di a g on s ed having live r can c er .
G o ing to S ha ng ha i and re ce v ing op er ation can re s c u e him .
A ll those will co st at least 1 5 0 0 0 0 y u an .
Where to get money ?
We re l at ive s also c a n ' t give him a hand , since we are all poor .
In fact , C h in a is strong er than before , po la ri z ation of ri ch and poor is de e p er .
When would me d ic in e s y s te m be per f e c t ?
And f ame r s w o n ' t worry about i ll ness one day ?

The se are some of her work .
I started work ing out from this J un e so it ' s been almost five month s .
When I first thought of re g is ter ing the g y m pro g r a m , I he s it at ed .
S in ce I consider ed myself not so con s is t ent , I was afraid that it might end s up a was te of money .
I want ed that could happen to me , too .
And I ga in ed 4 k g after a month la ter .
I gue s s that is because of my bad eat ing ha b b it .
M o st ly I eat s n a c k s and high c al or i e f o o d s .
I went to eat a hu m b er g er by b i ke .
That ' s all , but it was good .
s el f - in t ro d u ction
A l th ough I l ate w ri t ting , let me in t ro d u ce myself .
My name is sat o m i .
I ' m in ter st ed in j a p an e se c ul ture . ( ex .
k a b u k i , u k i y o e , and j a p an es idea s and so on )
And My favor ite act or is J o h n n y D e p p ! I think he is very co o l ! !
The act or who j a p an es is W at an a b e K en .
This happen ing has good effect for for e i g n country ' s people who are study ing J a p an e se because many J a p an e se people will c or re c t their J a p an e se .
I ' m now watch ing a T V pro g r a m m e on some effect ive and e f f ic i ent way s
So the T V pro g r a m m e me e t my need s .
However , so m th ing still re m a in s un c er tain .
That ' s whether I could take a ction or not .
They ga ve me l ot s of p ow er and l o ve .
When I feel s ad , I talk with friend s in the first .
And I will go sh op p ing to look something ha p p y .
To day I w o ke up , and my da d said , that we do n ' t have e le c t ri c ity .
I did n ' t know what can I do all day .
I c le an ed , I le ar n ed .
I did some ex c er c is es in sp an ish .
And I re al is ed , that I have to de ve l op .
: S B e c ous e I do n ' t know so many w or d s , for ex amp le : e g g - hu e v o .
Y e a h it is very difficult , be c ous e I always say hu es o , which mean bo ne .
And I re al is ed , that we , people c a n ' t live without e le c r t ic ity , we need it all the time .
And it is very s ad .
A fter that we had e le c t ri c ity I turn ed on the comp ut er and I made some t est s in e ng l ish , and I get 2 8 - 2 7 point s of 5 0 .
And I think it is bad .
I will go to E ng l and , and I ho pe , that I will le ar n a little .
T h an k You for read or c or re c t it .
F or th D a y
We had a different teacher to day again .
A c t u ally in this three days , we have had three different teacher for each day .
What I did to day is ; we had a dis s c us s ion about mar ri age in the morning class and did a v o c a b ul ar y qu i z e .
In the after no on class we talk ed about person al it ies ; and then went on to the mo v i e .

To m or r ow I have no after no on class , so I ' m going to go sh op p ing in D ow n t ow n and get something for L a m a , my ho st m o ther ' s gr and ch il d re n , for his b ir th day .

He ' s going to back to P h in e as where he works and he will have his s w ed d ing out there !
I wish him a s a f e tri p and ha p p y w ed d ing .

I can re c o g n i z e the di f f er ence between J a p an e se us ed 1 0 0 year s a g o and one us ed now easily .

My so n tri ed a S k y pe English L es s on , but he did i n ' t like it .
There is my first letter here . ) I live in R us s i a and st ad y in school .
Some days a g o our English teacher told about ex change in the U S A for one year .
This i nformation appear me re ally in te est ing because I want visit the U S A for le ar n ing English !
Yes ter day I found ed some i nformation about this po g r a m at the in ter ne t .
And I read that all students must have some comp e t i tion s before .
F ir st of all , they must pass the school ' s pro g r a m m t est s .
A fter that , when they did it well , th a y must came here again after week and w ro te es s a y and the second t est .
Then , when co m mission de s id e that you did it well again , you must came here again and write some t est s again .
How do you think , can I pass this comp e t i tion s ? ? ? = )
We want to believe this name help her .
I j o in ed L an g - 8 for ent er tain ment
I will c or re c t J a p an e se di ar y , but this s er v ic e is little bu s y . . . : - /
B e c a us e so many re st a ur ant s put `` V A L E N T I N E ' S D I N N ER `` a d s !
V al en tain e ' s D a y !
It was as s i g n ed by my teacher and going to present at next ' s th ur s day .
A fter finish ing it , I f e ll as le e p soon .
S ud d en ly , I felt my be d sha k ing , then the who le bu il d ing too !
I was f ri g h ten ed to j um p from my be d at that time , when I just had had a dr e a m .
I thought about what should I do if the next big sha ke come s , like the stuff b r ing ing with and the call ing to my sleep ful mother .
F or t un ate ly , after a while , it seemed like no more e ar th qu a ke would come , and I f e ll as le e p again soon .
In fact the sit u ation has been quite of ten at T a i w an , where the co ut ry have l o c at ed at a act ive se is m ic be l t .
It ' s not first time for me , though .
I still felt it s c ar ing , es pe c a il ly the ter ri ble one in C h in a had just pass ed by .
It took so many people ' s life , made th ous and s of people home less , and c r us h ed C h in a ' s e c on o m ic s .
I re ally can do nothing to be against the nature .
M a y b e all we can do is to accept it and be strong er .
We should not b l ame on the nature , or anything .
It ' s not re ve ng e of e ar th .
It ' s not a bad ome n for 2 0 0 8 O ly m p ic s , either .
It is just a natural even t for hu man to become so l id if i ed and a c c ust ome d to it .
I very p ity the v ic t im s of that e ar th qu a ke .
I H o pe they could go through the dis aster soon .
I go to Tokyo in w in ter va c ation .
B e c a us e I go to see my father , I feel to c r ow ed , more than T o k y o , another , I go to Y us h im a temple , and va ri ous p r a y er . and than feel to im p or t ant c ul t ur al her it age .

S h or t c ut ke y is very con ve n i ent .
D o es Some ome us e A ut o c ad ?
How is the di f f er ence between `` would n ' t `` and `` did n ' t `` in the sen t ence of my te x t ?
In this time , My question is the di f f er n ce of mean ing in two p h r as es .
The another is `` I [ did n ' t ] know the di f f er n ce . ``
So , you said to me `` You w or e sh o es home by mistake . ``
I said to you `` I who ud n ' t have know n the di f f er ence ``
And How do two p h r as es change the se mean ing ?
C o ul d you tea ch me the di f f er ence of two p h r as es ?
I think you say `` What happen `` ?
Yes ter day , I s ence that my comp ut er c a n ' t in p ut sound s from line - in .
( It ' s very bad . if nothing is done , I c a n ' t comp o se sound t r a c k s . )
I think ed it s a dr ive r is s u e and re in st al led sound dr ive r s .
But , It ' s wrong , And now I ' m try ing re in st a ll O S .
No w , I ' ve in st al led dr ive r !
. . but , my comp ut er c a n ' t re c o d ing . . .
This a ction is wrong , too . . .
J ust I do not w an n a be alone .
D a m n me . . .
I play ed s n ow b or d ing .
I was f un .
But my m us c le s were tired because of my age .
I get old than before .
I have a d d In ter v i e w .
B e c a us e I had so great In ter v i e w at last night .
To day my mo o d is l ow because it is ra in y .
I c a n ' t play outside .
It is b as ke t b a ll co m ic .
D o you know ?
M e an w h i le they say the g l o b al w ar m ing is de ve l op ing and that the e ar th is get ting w ar m er and w ar m er .
O ur history is no less than . 0 0 0 0 0 2 per c ent comp ar ed to the e ar th ' s history .
They say hu man being is da m a g ing the e ar th , which I think is may b e tru e .
D ur ing a two night s ' stay , we s k i ed 2 hour in the morning and in the after no on too .
F ir st time s n ow was p ow d er y , but la ter s n ow change d ar t if ic i al .
We enjoy ed to education al school tri p .
I , d like to work in Z a m a c amp .
B e c a us e , I like English and U .
But , my English is n ` t very good .
my friend said English was easy .
I understood that it was with d r a w al s y m p t o m s of qu it ting s m o k ing when I in ve st i g ate the cause .
But , I have to keep a no n - s m o k ing !
To day I want to tell about one more my ho b b y .
I interest ed in it when st ud i ed at the first year ( now I finish the th ir d ) .
I don ` t know whether you know about this game .
This game was c re at ed in B el ar us , M r .
The b as ic idea of game con s is t s in perform ance of va ri ous ta s k s for dis t ri c t s for a while .
The w in n er of game the play er or a command , is consider ed the first finish ed all le ve l s .
T h us the qu ant ity of ta s k s , se qu ence of their perform ance , time for perform ance of one ta s k are not re g ul at ed by r ul es and est a b l ish ed by a u th or s under their dis c re tion .
G ame pass es at the night .
And all the night your friend s and you tra ve l about the c ity , so l ve ri d d le s , sea r ch for co d es and t re as ur es in the most im p ro b able place s .
It can be both the th r ow n not comp le ted bu il d ing and the th r ow n ga r age s .
It usual ly take s some time to write down my idea s / thought s .
G r ad students are require d some a c ad e m ic s k i ll s .
R e ad ing and writing are most of them , and may b e dis c us s ion s k i ll as well .
A n y way , I try to write something in here as much as possible , at least keep do ing it for a while .
No w I ' m think ing what I am going to write . .
What is different n u ance ?
I had a pro d u c t ive day and it was hu m id yesterday .
B y the way I have n ' t p re p ar ed the N e w Y or k tri p yet , first I want to bu y a s u it case rather large s i z e .
I am ant ic i p at ing a big one , the one which could make you feel you are so p ow er less when s ur r ound ing by it , and feel the be a ut y of nature and the im p ul se to c ry .
A ll you could see is w h ite , w h ite , w h ite .
I must say I just ex p er ence d those feel ing s when I was , like 9 , walk ing in my p ri m ar y school c amp us with my mo m , with my hand in her s .
I can still re m b er the w ar m th in her hand .
F u ku s h im a is f a m o se for their hot springs and it is n ' t far away from my house .
There are many hotel s , which have hot sp r ing public bath , around the st ation there .
It ' s open - a ir bath was re ally n ic e and we re la x ed .
I think it is because of the hot sp r ing .
I am a con t r a c t e ng in e er .
I always in office for my work , but to day , I first go to work sit e with
e le c t ri c e ng in e er .
our work is bu il d ing M e t ro .
I like my job , I think it ' s in ter st ing
I tra ve led around three co un t ri es from 2 6 A p ri l to 4 M ar ch .
I went to V i e t n a m , L a o s , C a m b o d i a .
I ' m going to ent ry j o ur n al about my tra ve l tomorrow .
To day I ' m writing about the most impress ion thing .
It was a last day on my tra ve l .
I cha r ter ed t u k t u k for sight se e ing .
I went to the L and M in e M us e um .
It is a small m us e um .
It is p ri v ate ly own ed by A k i R a who was ch il d so l d i er for the K h y m er R o gue .
No w he want s to re m o ve all of l and mi ne s in C a m b o d i a .
A l ot of l and mi ne s which were re m o v ed by A k i R a are on display in the m us e um .
M an y c i v il i an s were s l aught er ed by the K h m er R o u g e .
There are so many v ic t im ' s bo ne s and s ku ll s in the me m or i al to w er .
I told with t u k t u k dr ive r about a l ot of things .
He told me about the K h m er R o u g e , P o l P ot and so on .
He can speak English f l u ent ly and can speak J a p an e se a little .
We told in mi x ed English and J a p an e se .
I wonder ed why he does n ' t become a to ur g u id e .
He said `` if you want a good job , you need a l ot of money in C a m b o d i a .
H on est ly , C a m b o d i a is a c or r up tion so c i e ty . ``
I think what is my life .
A t the same time , I also felt va in I am not that .
So , I de c id ed I would be b ri g h t like that f l or al .
It be T h ur s day . F ro m s te a m y J a p an
So how is every on e going to sp en d their s um m er va c ation ?
What would you want to do if you could comp le te ly be off ?
As far me , I would like to sp en d read ing some ar t b ook s at my favor ite c a f e dr in k ing a c up of sp ic ed tea or tri p where I have never visit ed .
My name is a y an a !
I ' m J a p an e se high s ch o o l st ud ent .
I like see ing so c c er .
I good at make a t ar t .
B e y !
My family was good terms in a long time a g o .
M a ther live s with you ng s is ter .
F a ther live s with el d er brother .
may b e they are little good terms even now .
because not me e t re c ent ly .
I just want to make a ha p p y family .
T h an k you for read ! !
the se sound only small change s , but I strong ly believe the se a c c um ul ation will le ad to big im p ro ve ment .
I found that when I can f o c us on my work , im sit ing up and feel my head is clear .
I take the e ng l ish class .
B e c a us e I want to t ar a ve l and talk people of tra ve ling country .
There are some class m ate in the e ng l ish class .
We ( My hu s b and and I ) would have go back to J a p an on A u g a st 3 r d , but my hu s b and ' s work is going to finish e ar ly than ta h t .
We have p l an go to S e at t le from J u ly 7 th for 4 days ( A c t u ally 3 night s stay ) , so we de c id ed go back to J a p an on J u ly 1 3 th .
L e f t - hand ed ness
I ' m left - hand ed .
M an y year s a g o , in J a p an , left - hand ed person s were ra re .
There is a reason .
M an y p ar ent s thought that left ies would le ad in c on ve n i ent live s - for ex amp le , most of too l s are made for right - hand ed person s .
They for c ed their ch il d re n to us e ti er right hand s .
In fact , I had some trouble in c ut ting things with s c is s or s , and my p ar ent s made me us e my right hand .
H a p p i ly ( ? ) I have been writing or us ing too l s with my left hand .
However , for the last four or five days , many teachers in J a p an have point ed out that the number of left - hand ed ch il d re n has been in c re as ing .
And we had a hand - rolled s us h i - part y .
We can ch o se ing r ed i ent s and put them and ri ce s on a la ver and ro ll it by our s el ve s .
But I heard that many E ur o pe an s and A m er ic an s do n ' t like la ver .
My K or e an friend ga ve me the re c i pe and I made it and serve d at the day .
I ' m ha p p y to day
My b ro k en le g is better and better , so that I can mo ve around with it , it l ' s feel good .
and the st ock make t of C h in a come s back from de a th to day , my st ock is up , too .
3 % point , it ' s a l u c k y day to day , ex c ept hot we a ther .
I eat a sp ic y hot p ot on S un day no on , but because of c he w ing not easily so I just eat d u c k b l o o d and be an c ur d .
It is part ly because I w an n a pass the U n ive r s ity I want to , and part ly because I just l o ve s English .
T h ough , U n f or t un ate ly , I could n ' t speak English any m or e because of the lack of p r a c t ic ing speak ing English , I ' ll try to .
wish it to di e t ! ! ! !
D i e t success is how do you think ? ?
F U J I that is to p of the mo un tain in J a p an 2 days a g o .
But I was re fresh ed when I ' ve see n the view of the c l o ud sea at the to p of M t .

This ex pe ri ence will help me s m o o th ly work with in ter n ation al co ll e a gue s and c l i ent s in your g l o b al or g an is ation al en v ir on ment .
A t six o ' clock , my D ad w a k ed me up and took ex er c is e to go walk ing with me near the p ar k .
When we came b a ce and stood in front of our home , the ne i g h b or un c le open ed his do or and said he ll o to us .

It was a dis g ust ing thing for me because I have the s ever e c le an f re a k so I c a n ' t end ur e any an im al ' s to u ch es .

My school f est i v al name is ' M o k - ry e on - j e ' .

W o ul d you come over my school f est i v al ?
I went to My e on g - don g with my bo y f ri en d yesterday .
We at e some de l ic i ous f o o d s and did w in d ow sh op p ing .
I want ed to bu y that but I was put off by the p ri ce first .
When we left the p u b , I re g re t ted not bu y ing the s w e at er and I tri ed to go the st or e again to bu y that .
However , the st or e was already close d and I simpl y had to just go home .
D es p ite I went watch ing mo v i e A v at ar this M on day ,
B e c a us e to day I a p p re s i at ed to my friend s that `` A v at ar is a great mo v i e ! `` , so my friend said she want ed to go soon ! !
I did n ' t think that I watch ed that mo v i e t w ic e .
but I would n ' t like to go three time .
Yes ter day , I at ten d ed the le c ture who se name is `` in ter n ation al con t ri b u tion le ad er train ing pro g r a m `` .
The pro g r a m started by 5 2 0 0 8 .
And the pro g r a m end ed yesterday .
I change d myself by this pro g r a m .
But I want to say only one w or d `` T h an k you very much ! ! `` .
A bout a d v ic e .
D o you follow a d v ic e when you asked for it ?
M o st of people I know ten d not to .
I do n ' t j ud j e them - every on e know s that it ' s easy to give a d v ic e to other s .
Some time s they just tell me : `` S or ry , but you do n ' t quite understand my sit u ation `` or `` T h an k you for your opinion , but it still see m s too compli c at ed for me , I need to think about it some more before I make any de s s is ion `` .
But some time s it turn s just ri d ic ul o ul s .
My friend tell s me : `` I need your a d v ic e `` and at the moment I feel all im p or t ance and respon s i b il ity of the question .
- I was going to some where with some body .
But then I let them down , and now they are cross with me .
I an a ly se and try to find the be st w or d s to explain my point of view .
I think about my friend ' s and friend of her ' s feel ing s and do my be st to be un b i as s ed .
I explain it to her and when I ' m done I feel like my pe ic e of a d v is e is n ' t a bad one .
And I know what it mean s : I ' d rather just p re ten d that nothing have happen ed .
Well , but I glad that her pro ble m s was not that serious as she told me .
P e op le always need some s up p or t , but never need any on e to told them what to do !
That is my opinion about a d v ic e ^ _ ^

Why I ch o o se to work as an a u pai r ?
On the 1 5 th of J u ly of the last year I came to L on d on with the idea of work like wait re s s , c le an er or something like that , so I r ent a room in a sh ar ed house in the e a st sub ur b of L on d on and started to look for a job .
One week la ter , I still not having she e t s in my be d cause my l and la d y had n ' t b r ing them yet .

And , on to p of that , the show er head work only if you put it at no more than 1 0 c en time t re s from the bo t t o m of the bath .
But at least I like d to have a show er stand ing up !
So , I c he c k ed all the po s s i b il it ies : a u pai r , hotel wait ing s ta f f , try another sh ar ed house , . . .
I thought pro s and con s of every job and f in ally de c id ed to make an a u pai r pro f i le in a sp e c i al ty we b s ite and look for a family .
And that ' s the reason for why I end ed work ing as an a u pai r .

A bout 2 hour s after , they said that the C on t i ent al A ir p la ne can help us that change the another a ir p la ne and we can go on tri p right away .
Then I have to the T er m in al and go to the another ga te in or d er to I can go to P en s a c o la as quick ly as possible .
S h ar n ' s first trouble was end ed .
In 8 : 3 0 I ar ri v ed in the H ous t on in ter n ation al a ir p or t , w h n I p re p ar ed to go to another b or ad ing ga te , the f light number and de st in ation was change d , I as k the for n t desk of C on t i ent al A ir p la ne and they told that this f light was c ance ll ed cause the bad we a ther on the no r th of the A m er ic a and So I had to stay in a hotel in one night .

but , next month I ' m going to see them for the first time .
I wish they will like this T - shirt s .
I started to walk ing every day .
I want to do run n ing , but it ' s too hard for me .
This p ar k is pretty big , and many f l ow er ga r d en s in it .
No w , the ra pe b l o s s o m s and the kind of ch er ry b l o s s o m s are at their
But my f o ot and back hu r t s .
O h my go d , to m or ro is M on day again and we have to hand in our week en d home w or k , but there are so much home w or k to do .
I ha te writing down the English sen t ence s that I w ro te in wrong way s for so many time s .
It does n ' t make any effect on my English le ar n ing !
What I need to do is just c or re c t in one time and re m e m b er them so that I w o n ' t make the same mistake s again .
O h I re ally do n ' t re al i z e what the teachers are think ing .
B less me . . .
I at ten d ed to a C h ri st m as part y in ch ur ch on last S at ur day that was he l d for work ing people .
They he l d many simple game s .
There re m a in last 4 people and 3 cha ir s .
A girl of them , who is my friend , took off the cha ir another girl was try ing to sit on and she f e ll on her back s id e !
It was un b el i e v able for me because I ' ve done same thing when I was ch il d and my teacher s c o l d ed me so much .
Some people say it ' s an in ter n ation al school , might be . . , but in fact it ' s a l ot more than that .
It ' s a no n - pro f it or g an i z ation that b r ing s students from around the g l o b e to g e ther , students are se le c ted on me ri t through a to t al or part i al s ch o l ar s h i p pro g r a m , so the ability to pay is n ' t take n in co un t at all .
I want one of those s ch o l ar s h i p s so bad , it ' s my dr e a m to get to know more of the world , get to know a l ot of c ul ture s , to be able to speak for e i g n language s f l u ent ly .
And being able to le ar n all of that from people with such different back g r ound s , it ' s what make s U W C so sp e c i al to me , it ' s the per f e c t place for everything that I want to do .
I just c a n ' t im a g in e the way it would n ' t im p a c t on my life , such a wonder ful ex pe ri ence .
My brother of ten made me s ad since he had finish ed the s er v ic e in the ar m y .
He began to s m o ke and play game day and night in c y b er c a f e .
F or this , my little s is ter and I had to of ten find him to c y b er c a f e .
H is p h on e was always close d and he did ' t go to home to sleep at night .
I re m e b er ed for wait ing him , re s ul t in we e p ing all night .
My p ar ent s ho p ed that he can go to C h in a with them to g e ther and they may b e change his te m p and bad ha b it s .
But he insist to stay in T a i w an and keep ing bad be ha v i or , he made us pai n and help less .
To day my father was ra re to come to T a i w an , I was very ha p p y .
And then my brother s id that he had a t est . ( I do n ' t tru st him , he had to be go to c y b er c a f e . )
So we wait ed him unti l 6 o ' clock , he did ' t still come home and my father los e his te m p er .
( If it ' s time at 1 0 : 0 0 o ' clock and he does ' t still come home , we de c id e to l ock the do or . )
A t 8 : 0 0 , when my brother came home , we were p re a p r ing for shout ing at him .
S ud d ent ly he said that I de c id ed to go to C h in a with father , because I c a n ' t hold on myself .
We were so surprise d and began to open our smile s .
It ' s so s ur p ri s ing that I can t believe it !
I always re ally worry him .
A l th ough t I do n ' t know he go to C h in a if it is a good thing , he want to change himself make me ha p p y .
It ' s one of J a p an e se H o l i day to day .
B y the way , I like mo un tain much more .
( as ho l i day of co ur ce ) .
D o you know that J a p an ( being said as work a h o l ic country ) has 1 5 ho l i day s and the se are most in de ve l op ed co un t ri es ?
O f co ur ce , I did n ' t know .
I got a little free time , so I re st ar t L an g - 8 ! !
A l ot of things happen ed this month .
I c a n ' t de s c ri b e all things but our family is very good now .
O ur re l at ive do n ' t live in To h o ku are a but my hu s b and ' s friend ' s house was dr if ted by big t s un a m is .
We always worry his family .
I have a s light f ever .
tomorrow is like ly work hard .
It was very hot there , and I got a s un b ur n in my left ar m .
A th en s are full of people and di la p id at ed an c i ent mo n u ment s .
The tri p in A th en s does n ' t make me re la x ed .
R es ul t of 1 7 th s ept e m b er work
To day , I thought it very de e p ly .
What should be the ar t is t , What should a bu s s in es man .
When I make it a mistake , B r and i g in p a c t .
I receiv ed a letter from a you ng girl from U .
I am interest ed in you , I will like you e m a il me back at my ( f a v o ur b ar k an i @ y a h o o .

H a w a i i V o l , 2
To day , I write about my tri p again .
There was v i v id ma g ent a B o u g a in v il le a near the Ka il u a be a ch p ar k .
It was de l ic i ous a f r u it s al ad I or d er ed .
This be a ch is very f a m ous e about that the sea t ur t le come to have s un b a th .
A t this time , there is no sea t ur t le on the be a ch , in s te ad there is a ha w a i i an mo n k .
He was big and just sleep ing on the be a ch .
I think that all s y s te m s in this world has an a d v ant age and a dis ad v ant age .
I have many home w or k .
So I ' m going to go to l i b r ar y to do it . . . . .
In s te ad of did n ' t do it , I got great me m or ies ! !
To day , I went to a d ent is t .
c u z I have a too th a ch e at last night -
it ' s very pai n ful , I do n ' t w an n a go to a d ent is t .
but I have to go tm w again for my te e th ri d g e .
I do n ' t know why I have a c a v ity da k ne un d e , I take a b r us h on da i ly .
B a b y has come !
The year 2 0 1 1 has started with b r ing ing a new b a b y to my family .
H is old er brother , P a x like s to take care of him .
It ' s l o ve ly to see the old er try ing to hold the little one and to he ar what he talk s to the b a b y .
P e op le say the old er one of ten get s j e al ous to the new come r and act s n as ty , or be ha ve s like a b a b y .
Yes , I can see now P a x some time s p re ten d s to be a small b a b y - he want s to s u c k my b re a st a little and he c r a w l s .
I look for w ar d to see ing how they gr ow their re l ation s h i p between two brother s .
I ho pe they can be the be st friend s with each other .
I ' m B e g an to le ar n English
I ' m un ive r s ity st ud ent .
( look s like a f en c ing ) I started it at e le ment ar y st ud ent .
So I ' m play ing K en d o so long time .
L a st year I went to F r ance To ul ous e one month .
there was a very good place ! !
It was very funny , because first time I try to speak F re n ch but I could n ' t co m m un ic ate with people well .
So after f e w days , I became always us ing English .
I ' m interest ed in the c ul ture of va ri ous country .
I want to talk with different country people .
The Project M an age r should have a set of s k i ll s or te ch n i qu es , includ ing the a b il it ies to raise the sh ar p question s , de te c t the un k n ow n as s um p tion s , and so l ve the con f il ic t s between people , e t c .
, and includ ing many s k i ll s in mo d er n man age ment as well .
The ma j or respon s i b il ity of the Project M an age r is to id ent if y different ri s k s to affect the success of the Project , which should be me as ur ed by for m al or in f or m al way s through o ut the who le pro j e c t ' s life time .
R is k s always g en er ate from the un c er tain ty of the pro j e c t .
A success ful pro j e c t man age r of ten take s the ri s k s as the matter being pai d much close at ten tion to .
I agree with such a opinion as a qu al if i ed pro j e c t man age r is not only from study ing but more from p r a c t ic ing .
I will go on a school tri p in H o k k a id o on S ept e m b er 1 5 ~ 1 8 .
I have never been to H o k k a id o so I ' m look ing for w ar d to going there .
In fact , I hard ly know about there .
So I do n ' t tea ch you the i nformation .
But I will tell you the me m or y when I return a school tri p .
I first ly read J a p an e se ver s ion when I was 6 or 7 year s old .
This is a second b ook of the s er ies `` My F a ther ' s D r a g on `` as you know .
It s English is easy but it make s me clear ly im a g in e each scene .
The r h y th m of sen t ence s are easy to read .
This story begin s with the scene in which the dr a g on s a v ed and f l i ed away from the is l and where the f er o c i ous an im al s had l ock ed him .
9 - year s E l m er s a v ed the dr a g on .
No w they were on their way home .
F ir st they set on T an g er in a I s l and with many of ta ng er in es .
A fter s u f f er ing from st or m , they f l i ed down to a little gr e en is l and .
A t that place they me t can ar ies who se k ing were sick of c ur i o s ity .
This is the end of the for m er part .
The l at ter I will write tomorrow .
B e c a us e , I st ud i ed with my friend K , about op t im is t ic train ing for sp e c i al education ch il d re n .
I have want ed to this study for long time .
So , I felt that to day was a day of my dr e a m s came tru e !
So , I felt sat is f i ed that time .
it turn ed to be s un n y
To m or r ow I m go n n a take a S S A T .
g im me a l u c k & p l z cross ur f ing er s ( every on e on L an g - 8 ) for me !
C ur r ent ly , I usual ly watch ing English mo v i e for English - language a c qu is i tion .
My favor ite mo v i e is as follow ing ,
- B a c k to the future
- K i k i ' s de l ive ry s er v ic e
- The ho l i day
I like S F , l o ve ro m ance , and a ction .
The mo v i e which I like is a fine feel ing and a feel ing gentle .
O r P le a se let me know a wonder ful mo v i e also in difficult English .
E ver y time he came to our house before , he brought us something n ic e and ex ot ic from C h in a , but that night he ra n out of the so u ve no ir s he had brought from home .
So he hand ed out to my d aught er s two p la st ic c age s , one for each , in which a little c re a ture was ma k ing ra t t ling no is es on the pe b ble s .
I l o ve an im al s but I had never care d for re p t il es so much .
To my surprise , I told our gue st a w h ite lie , saying that the t ur t le s he brought were so c ut e .
Y e ar s pass ed and they gr e w .
I once brought them to a ve t when they got sick ( s y m p t o m s - - - no a p pe t ite and s w o ll en eyes , treat ment - - - two sh ot s ) and sp ent 2 0 0 do ll ar s .
No w I l o ve them .
It ' s so funny that l o ve come s out of no where .
It ' s p ur e e m o tion .
My d aught er has name d the t ur t le s M a i - cha n and C h i b i - cha n , but I ' m se c re t ly call ing them J ul i a and R o b er t .
I ' m very ex cited now , for I ' ve know n this sit e .
I ' m le ar n ing English and want to im p ro ve my English .
I did n ' t know there is a us e ful we b s ite like this .
pro g r a m ing is very difficult
to day , I start to st ad y pro g r a m ing .
but I d id n ' t understood p h p .
it is very difficult .
I write di ar y in English for the first time .
It ' s tra ve l to for e i g n country with my father .
When I was a ch il d , I pro m is ed my father to be able to speak English and to take him to for e i g n country .
So , I study English and take him to for e i g n country .
On mo n day morning if you have b re a k f a st in an It al i an b ar you ' ll listen commen t s about the re s ul t of s un day f o ot b a ll ma t ch es .
In It al i an ch amp ion s h i p there are 2 0 tea m s ( in P re m i er L e a gue ) ; the tea m s with the be st play er s are : J u v ent us , In ter , M il an and R ome .
E ver y s un day the tea m s begin play ing at 3 o ' clock p . m . , the ma t ch last s 9 0 minute s .
So on after the end , sp or t s pro g r a m s a ir s on t v ti ll 7 p .
There are l in k - up s with sp or t s j o ur n al is t in each st ad i um , in ter v i e w s to the co a ch es or play er s and im age s of s ever al go al s , corner k ic k s , free k ic k s , p en al ty k ic k s , ex p ul s ion s , w ar n ing s and f a il ed go al s .
A fter p ri m e time , other sp or t s pro g r a m s start again for those who in the after no on did n ' t stay at home watch ing the te le v is ion .
On mo n day morning after `` a day `` te le v is ion commen t ar ies there are also those of the f an s !
Why did I de c id e like that ?
A c t u ally I do not re m e m b er that why I ch o se the w or d .
I would be able to call `` no m ad `` to me .
B e c a us e I have been un able to stay one place 3 month s more .
B e c a us e of that ex pe ri ence s , I could do the job with va ri ous s k i ll s .
I do not know my s ch ed ul e how long to stay here .
A l th ough many people living in this a c c o m o d ation is get ting w or ri ed
I can ex pe ri ence di ver s ed life style s with this time in A ust r al i a .
A t least , I will ex a c t ly p r ed ic t that I think I get good ex pe ri ence s in A ust r a il a
if I am back to So u th K or e a .
D o you know a new s that a me ri c an guy got $ 2 3 2 mi ll ion j a c k po t ?
I c a n ' t even im age the am o un t of it !
A re al l u c k y guy !
I wish I were him .
But I worry him a b it this g i g ant ic mo ne dr ive him c r a z y or make him r u in his life .
M as s me d i a over ly re p or t him .
I know this is an affair get v i w er at ten tion , includ ing me .
I think they should think over again their sen s ation - see k ing nature .
I ho pe people s ur r ound ing him leave him alone a little .
when I dr e w a de e p b re a th I feel better .
but I feel being l on le y .
I b ro ke up with bo y f ri en d f e w week s a g o .
I c a n ' t even see him because he live in another country .
and also I b ro ke of re l ation s h i p with friend .
she was my be st f ri en d .
but she made me un p le as ant and r ud e , I do n ' t w an n a to u ch with her any m or e .
It ' s re ally hard time for me .
however I feel re l if e ,
I try ing to get a job .
I ' m go n n a make money and then I ' ll go to t re ve l alone .
ch in a , ti b e t , ne p al , In d i a , T ha il and !
I f a il ed get a job f e w time s , but It ' s O k .
I keep try ing that .
I ho pe make new good friend s ! !
To day , I have a too th a ch e .
I ' m wonder ing whether I sh o l d go d ent al c l in ic or not .
This is my favor ite sub j e c t , and so interest ing !
The picture you can see in my pro f i le is a pack age of j i g s a w p u z z le .
I thought I could finish it in a week or so . . . . . .
But it ' s very very difficult ! ! ! ! ! !
M o st of piece s are re d , so all piece s look a like .
I have n ' t finish ed it yet , for your i nformation .
My ho b b ies are s k i and j ud o .
I have s k i ed since I become j un i or high school st ud ent .
But this co st is very in c r ed i ble high ! !
On the other hand , j ud o is a reason able sp or t .
I have black be l t .
But re c ent ly , I ' ve got no day because I a w o ke all night long and then s l ept unti l the s un
sh in ing right a b o ve my head .
This is kind of we ir d that how hard I try , it ' s get ting w or se and
It ' s already e i g h t in the morning and no need to say , I am still keep ing my eyes open even
with a b re a k f a st !
I would c re e p into my be d in a f e w minute .
Why I ch o o se to day education as a sub j e c t ?
M a y b e because as a kind er g ar d en finish ing ch il d ' s father I ' m conc er n ed about what my da u g ther is going to be t aught in the next year s .
And because I re al i z e now , when it has become my pro ble m , that now a day s education in school s need s to face se ve er al cha ll e ng es to be us e ful l for the ch il d re n an for the so c i e ty .
O f course I ' m not an ex p er t , and sure I ' m going to be un a c c ur ate and sub j e t ive , but I ' m going to talk about how I per c i e ve the sit u ation .
F ir st of all I think we must face the fact that the pro ble m s are not going to be so l v ed cha ng ing the c ur ri c ul um if we do n ' t help the teachers to a d a p t themselves to it .
We ' re going to take a t ent , a sleep ing b a g , and so on with us so that we can sleep in the t ent in the mo un tain .
It ' s the first time for me to stay in a t ent in a mo un tain , so it sound s re ally ex c it ing .
It has an o b el is k on it s pe a k .
I ho pe that I can c ar ry those he a v y s ta f f s and enjoy c l im b ing .
I l u v tra ve ll ing and I had never tra ve ll ed by myself before unti l I felt it was time 4 me to s l i p away to get some fresh a ir outside in A p ri l .
I sure ly know that it is ir re s p on s i ble to dis a p pe ar without saying good b y e to da d & mo m .
what ' s more , I de f in ite ly know that I would hu r t them , s c ar e them and let them worry about me .
but , at that moment , I just w an n a take my ti c ke t , sea r ch ing some place s to c al m down and re le a se str es s .
L i j i an g , a place where I could te m p or ar i ly for g e t the p re s s ur e , s l ow down the p a ce and enjoy myself l o un g ing and tak ing p ic s free ly and co m f or t ably .
the old town re ally ga ve me a sh ot 2 p ur if y and b or d en my mind .
I made friend s with strange r s and now still keep in to u ch with them .
some time s I ' d l u v 2 re v i e w them , re m in d ing me of those face s , the s m e ll of s un s h in e and my f o ot p r in t s along all the tri p .
I ' m le ar n ing English in school ( 3 year s ) .
3 year s a g o I was le ar n ing G er man ( 6 year s !
And I was the be st in the class ) , but now I for g ot everything : < I w an n a le ar n F in n ish , but It ' s very difficult .
I ' m interest ed in other c ul ture s , at most J a p an ( and other s As i an co un t ri es too ) , so when you ' re J a p an e se , or S ing a po re an , or K or e an , or other As i an , just write to me .
And I go to the B ad in h square to see the n ation al f l at to ri se .
But many people come there e ar l i er to ex er c is e .
A fter the d y s a c ous i a w h is t le , the n ation al an th e m s ing s strong .
E ver y body has a de c ent and di g n if i ed stand and re s ive s il ent ly through the s ing .
when the f la g is ri se on the to p of the f la g to w er is right time to finish the an th e m . .
I m re ally ex cited right now ! ! !
A c t u ally my bo y f ri en d can c or re c t my es a a y but I don t want to as k him . . . because it ' s a little b it e m b ar r as ing .
So I m us ing this sit e for my English s k i ll to im p ro ve .
I think I ll write a b l o g c as u a ly some time s .
And im going to po st a T O E F L writing es s a y as well : )
I am e m b ar r as ed to say that I am not good at English but l o ve to le ar n English .
Besides that if you want to le ar n j a p an e se , I am ha p p y to help you ,
Well , let me c ut my re d un t ant in t ro d u ction he ar and make some co ment s on l ate st new s which dr e w my at ten tion .
A ccord ing to j a p an e se T V new s , 46 0 0 0 people return to J a p an after sp en d ing go l d en week in for e i g n country which is a co ll e ction of some n ation al ho l i day s .
D u e to th re ad of s w in e f l u e , so many people includ ing n ur se and a ir p or t s ta f f c he c k the tra ve l er .
I saw one of those tra ve l er s who return d from me x ic o comp la in ed has s le in a ir p or t .
but he should n ' t have go ne if he comp la in ed .
R e m e m b er that go ver ment w ar n ed against all no n - es s ent i al tra ve l in a d o v ance and there are some people work ing on this case now in s te ad of sp en d ing ho l i day .
C ha ng ing My M in d
We f in ally de c id ed to the d ate for mo v ing .
We will mo ve to another place to us e three days ho l i day s : 2 1 , 2 2 and 2 3 of No ve m b er .
There f or e , I must pack all stuff in my house alone in twenty days .
It sound s re ally t ough for me . . . . . .
I gue s s that my d aught er some time s will help me but I do n ' t expect it .
In addition , if some on e help s me , I will get con f us e the con t ent of bo x es which I do n ' t pack by myself .
There f or e , I want to pack them alone .
I ' m sure that I must pack over 2 0 0 bo x es .
O h my go s h !
In this mo v ing , I will th r ow away all un ne ce s s ar y things .
I know that there are bu n ch of bo x es which I have n ' t open ed yet after I mo v ed here .
While I ' ve live d here , I b ough t a l ot of things again .
I re g re t that I was te money to bu y un ne ce s s ar y things .
A re you the person who can th r ow away un ne ce s s ar y things ?
In my case I ' m s ting y and I c a n ' t th r ow away them d ar ing ly .
And I ' ve kept a l ot of c ar d b o ar d bo x ed which have not been open ed yet in my house .
I will th r ow away all such bo x es this time .
I want to change my mind and be a good house man age r more .
My home is very old , which had been con st r a c ted more than 3 5 year s a g o .
But I like my home because it is very at t r a c t ive !
One of the reason s is how kind re s id ent s are .
Some time s they s c o l d him tender ly because of his in no c ence .
So I can feel that many re s id ent s watch my so n and I re ally than k them .
However I have to mo ve f e w week s la ter !
The new home is not so far from here and it s e qu i p ment s are not old .
But I have a con f id ence that I mi s s my present s w e e e t old home in the near ly future .
I mo v ed into B ur w o o d where is l o c at ed in we s ter n sub ur b of S y d ne y .
There are many C h in e se also no cha g ing the c ity , so I could see many C h in e se in here .
I just have been to some sub ur b s - - such as S il ver w at er , S t r a th f i el d , M an ly - - so I have not have any i nformation s about that .
However it was more pe a ce ful and play ful than things I think .
I entered here as short - ter m a c c o m on d ation - - it is similar to back p a c k er - - so I had to bu y my own f o o d s .
L u c k i ly , it was near to W o o l w or th from my a c c o m on d ation , so I b ough t so m th ing easily .
As a re s ul t , I became as the c ity person .
When I was in So u th K or e a , I live d in the country s id e .
A n y way it would take long time to a d a p t myself e to new c ir c um t ance .
L a st ly , I feel so fresh now because the at m o s p he re of outside is so s il ent and co o l for me .
I dr un k too much and I have a head a ch e now .
But I had such a great night because I enjoy ed It al i an f o o d s and dr an k l ot s .
I expect ed that I would be ha m m er ed .
I ' ve never had a head a ch e d ur ing dr in k ing .
I ' m kind of sh ock ed because I feel I ' m a poor dr in k er .
I ' m a b s o l ut e ly in d is c ri m in ate when it come s to m us ic and I can listen everything from p op to class ical m us ic .
I ' m just laugh ing that she is like a man .
I went with her , but just to ha ng out in M o s c ow ( I like M e ta ll ic a only with the s y m p h on y or ch est r a and some b al la d s as well ) .
This sp r ing she is going to go to He l s in k i F in l and to see I ro n M a id en and she c a n ' t wait !
My first di ar y in English
My o c c up ation is a de s g in er who make a pro m o tion mo v i e in a certain game comp an y .
I like read ing ( for e i g n no ve l s in particular ) , co ll e c ting f i g ur es and the in ter ne t .
I ' ll w h ite those things in the di ar y .
F ir st time come to here
It was ty p h o on last night .
But to day , it is very funny .
A l s o , I could see M t .
It has a l ot of s n ow , and it looked very beautiful .
I mean I de c id ed to us e the pai d study ha ll that my you ng er brother go es .
A t first , I could n ' t access the in ter ne t by w i re less L A N at the study ha ll .
But I have been able to access the in ter ne t since I had comp la in ed to a janitor of the study ha ll about that .
He re is quiet and co m f or t able for study ing and work ing .
I can put dis t ance between me and every te m p t ation and b re a k away from the c r ow d , if I am in here .
I am able to understand that my brother go es here every day .
B y the way , I think janitor of the study ha ll have nothing to do all the time .
I en v y him and I want to run a study ha ll one day .
W h i ch is c or re c t ?
W i h ch sen t ence is c or re c t ?
I w a ke up in the e ar y morning to day .
C o o l w in d blow s from the w in d ow .
H as A ut um n come ?
I was b or n in A ut um n , so I like this sea s on .
It ` s ex is t for A ut um n .
When I as k a question of the or i g in of the id i o m `` co l d t ur ke y `` ,
So he go o g led it , and he answered the question .
If more English teachers have their class on line ,
it become s more easy for English le ar n er s to take them .
I am think ing a simple idea ,
it is when I po st a new ent ry on my b l o g with language ch in e se .
Then I also po st a new ent ry on L an g - 8 with language e ng l ish ,
both of two are same con t ent .
L a st F ri day it he l d A th l etic F est i v al in my old est d aught er ' s e le ment ar y school .
She was enjoy ing it and show ed me ex ce ll ent scene in her ho ot - ra ce .
She was always last position in her me m b er s of three .
B o th bo y and girl in three are the de le g ate of re la y ra ce .
She said that I was always last .
He r mother told her that do n ' t never give up !
In this ra ce she did n ' t be first but she w on the girl .
She ga ve us the be st smile in the day from her go al .
On S at ur day , I went a works h op about He r b .
A c t u ally my close friend is Y o g a teacher .
She is interest ed in all of he al th y life , for ex amp le M a c ro b i ot ic s f o o d
, He r b and A y ur v ed a and so on .
F ro m her in f l u ence , I have been interest ed in my own body and mind too .
The works h op ' s teacher came to my friend ' s st ud i o from next p re f e c ture !
She came to here with l ot s of her b and some too l s by her dr i v ing .
She is like a s un f l ow er and has a very natural at t it ud e , po s it ive p ow er .
I like d her soon .
To day is over , I will tell you about the de ta il of works h op next j o ur n al .
Yes ter day I play ed f o ot s al ( kind of s a m ll so c c or ) with my friend s .
We enjoy ed it from 1 0 : 0 0 a m to 1 2 : 0 0 p m .
but it was a w ful hot day in O k a y a m a J a p an yesterday .
So one of our me n b er felt un c o m f or t ably , and he v o m it ed .
We b a k ed in the b la z ing s un .
I still have pai n in my s k in . o h h h h
E ver y time when I see J im P ar s on s or even he ar his name , I c a n ' t help b ur st ing into laugh .
He is a very p op ul ar come d i an and play s the ro le of She l d on C o op er in The B i g B an g The or y .
I like watch ing his show for two reason s .
F ir st , see ing his express ion s on his face , his mo ve ment s , is a re al re la x .
What ever the mo o d you are in , he can make you laugh .
J ust like U n c le M c D on al d that is just try ing to make you ha p p y .
S e c on d , all his line s are well de s i g n ed , not just something you for g e t after the show .
He put his de e p thought s into a hu m or ous way of express ion , so you can always find something new and re fresh in your re m e m b er of his ma g ic smile on the st age .
This is why J im P ar s on s always make s me laugh .
I came back home now , I ' m tired to day . . .
I had an English class from e ar ly morning , and then I had a part time job of T e a ch ing As s is t ant .
It was s un n y in morning but s ud d en ly ra in ed when I have being T A ( it ' s an out d o or class ) , we we t in ra in . . .
A fter that , I did my re se ar ch for m aster ' s the s is unti l . . . . . .
That ' s all the things what I did to day . . .
G o ing to see the ch er ry b l o s s o m s .
We made a g i p b a p l un ch for a p ic n ic .
A n y way , since that morning , The we a ther was very dark and ch il ly .
we wonder ed whether bu d s came into f l ow er or not .
U n f or t un ate ly , There were in no b l o s s o m s in N a m s an .
To see full b l o o m s of ch er ry b l o s s o m s in S e o ul , we may wait unti l this week en d .
F in ally , I know that my English s k i ll s are w or st le ve l .
but I ' m ha p p y because I got to know L an g - 8 and so many teachers ( = my new friend s )
I will think English is f un not study . .
so m time s I ' m so bu s y with work .
but I will try to keep the p r a c t ic e
T h an k you for all of you help ing again . .
I not ic ed a r ul e that she see m s to have about this hu g g ing : when I ' m hu g g ing her b a b y s is ter H ar u - cha n , she never as k s me to .
L an g - 8 is very he a v y to day .
They tri ed to find the in p ir ation for th i er work from their f a m il i ar s ur r ound ing s .
F or ex amp le , C l u ad e M on e t was the most at t r a c ted pai n ter by the change of light and co l o ur .
He dr e w the same scene s di f f er in light .
But R en o ir and D e g as had s light different prefer ence of ch o o s ing sub j e c t s .
They enjoy ed to pai n t the people in the world .
E s pe c i ally , he dr e w his friend s and f a m il ies a l ot .
L a st entrance ex a m was not so co o l that . .
I took e ng l ish ex a m on last s un day .
L a st time I took the ex a m was about one and half year s a g o .
B y tak ing same ex a m again , I re al i z ed my English read ing s k i ll went down . . .
It see m s I los t s ence of read ing English .
I had ch ance to speak English with my friend s .
But I never act u ally read any b ook s or write sen t ence in English .

E ver y s um m er , some F ri en ch st ud ent stay in S h i k i , where I live .
L a st year my family was a ho st family and a st ud ent stay ed for two week s .
We had re ally good time with him , so I want ed to invite this year , but my mother said no because she knew she would be bu s y this s um m er .
I was sorry that we would n ' t stay with a st ud ent , so I want ed to help in some way s and I asked if I could help .
I expect ed some job , but she said the number of the students was small er than usual so they do n ' t need help .
That was a p ity for me because I had been e age r to me e t and talk with them .
I was s ing le because other gue st s were not in the re st a ur ant .
A fter I mo d f i ed my first
di ar y , I was glad of get ting friend ' s help , who come s from another country .
There were de a th s , that ' s s ad .
R e c ent ly e ar th qu a ke s has cause d da m age s world w id e .
It all make s me think that the end of our age it ' s near .
The most de v a st at ing e ar th qu a ke was in 1 9 8 5 ( 8 . 1 R i ch ter ) , with about 1 0 0 0 0 de ad s .
The G o ver n ment hi d i nformation because they did n ' t want that people re al i z ed the ma g n it ud e of the even t .
The G o ver n ment also did it because they were the c ul p ri t s of a l ot of de ad s cause d by the bad p l an n ing of bu il d ing s .
This year , I have live d three or four se is m s - I c a n ' t re m e m e b er how many , my head is full .
They were of high ma g n it ud e , between 5 . 5 and 7 in R i ch ter S c al e .
I am w or ri ed , probab ly there will be a great e ar th qu a ke in M e x ic o which will de st ro y the c ity ( M e x ic o C ity ) .
The c ity is bu il t over a la ke s y s te m , bu il d ing s w o n ' t re s is t .
U n t il when do people re st ar t their life ?
I saw a question in a J a p an e se we b s ite .
`` U n t il when do people re st ar t their life ? ``
F or in st ance , when you re al i z ed your o c c up ation was not s u it able for you , what would you do ?
If you are you ng , probab ly it ' s not so difficult to go back to school and try to become what ever you want .
I found many answer s that told it was about 3 0 year s old .
I ' m so s ad to see this answer .
3 0 is still kind f o very you ng .
I gue s s it may va ry depend ing on the country they live .
What do you think , old man can re st ar t their life with full of ho pe ?
If so , how old is a limit ?
S in ce I already have a dr ive r ' s l ic en se in J a p an , I felt a p p ly ing for dr ive r ' s l ic en se here is not so difficult .
Even so , regard less of dr ive r ' s l ic en se st at us in over se as , every on e need s to take a paper t est and behind - the - w he el t est again , so I took a t est at D M V .
A t first , I went to a near est D M V , but they turn ed down my a p p l ic ation to dr ive r ' s l ic en se t est since my v is a st at us was still in an a p p ly ing for ex ten s ion p ha se .
A p ar t from that , since I heard some bad r um or re la ted to the near est D M V , I went to a second close one from my a p ar t ment .
In the second close one , they accept ed my a p p l ic ation .
I thought I should have been there at the first place .
B e c a us e some r ul es are different from J a p an such as it ' s le g al to turn right on a re d light here , so I st ud i ed and p re p ar ed well for both of t est s .
He was strong b al d guy with s un g la s se s and never change d his face express ion and no r smile d .
He re m in d s me T er m in at or - I ho p ed he say `` No pro ble m `` .
When I to go in show , I am very surprise d , many pro d u c t s are sp e c i al , I c a n ' t believe them can do it , I think them will sp en d much time and co st much money , very hard .
I am a de s i g n er too , for the time be i g n , I c a n ' t do those pro d u c t s , but , I will to str ive , I believe I can do it in future .
I got to t ally tired to day , because I began work ing in the office after a 9 - days - ho i day s .
W h o le the per i o d of ho l i day s , I sat up too l ate and got up too l ate .
So I must a d j ust my time z on e .
B y the way , in J a p an , old people like to work without any sp e c if ic reason s .
it ' s ra in y to day .
I at e a in st ant noodle because I did n ' t want to go outside to bu y l un ch .
I can bu y some f o o d s by the se .
But it ' s con ve n i ent es pe c i ally in ra in y day .
So it become r ust y , further m or e it ' s le a k ing water .
And I ro b b ed off the r ust by s and paper .
I and four S p an ish girl went to H y d e p ar k to p ic n ic .
One S p an ish girl is le aving at L on d on next week so I made S us h i for her .
She said she like s my S us h i .
We had some stuff and dr in k too much and s m o ke .
We enjoy ed To day .
My listen ra ng e is w il d ( or p re v a il ing ? ) from p op ra p r ock to J a z z and class ic .

H is m us ic always have good prais e and great s el ling re c or d s .
S e c on d one J o l in M o st of her m us ic style is close to the f a st dance m us ic .
That one make s people j o y and good spirit g en re .
What is the be st , almost her p u b l ish ed al b um s will c re at a new dance st ly e and le ad to the fashion among the you ng people .
I will in t ro d u e the re st ar t is t s next time .
I did n ' t know this b and about 1 month a g o .
My girl f ri en d re c o m m en d ed me to listen this b and so ng s , then I came to be into this .
The ir sound , voice and ly ri c are so good .
He re are two so ng s in this al b um .

I also visit ed ma th p rofessor and p h il o s op h y p rofessor .

P le a se listen to my in t ro d u ce ! !
My name is y u k i .
I ' m n in e te en year s old .
I ' m second year co ll e g e st ud ent .
I be l on g ed to the so f t ten n is c l u b for six year s .
O f course , I like so f t ten n is all of sp or t s .
No t only that , I like v o l ly b a ll , b as ke t b a ll and so on .
I of ten go to see J a p an e se mo v ies .
I do n ' t see for e i g n mo v ies at all .
My dr e a m is work ing tra ve l comp an y .
F ir st of all , I want to study about J a p an e se to ur is t at t r a ction .
T h an k you for listen ing .
I did n ` t feel well from yesterday .
So , I was in be d all day .
M a y b e I ` ve c aught a co l d .
I was very bu s y days re c ent ly .
I had a K or e an ` s friend .
He speak e J a p an e se very well .
I though that K or e an ` s man is very c ut e ^ ^
But , he is you ng er than me . . .
And , I though .
I was interest ed by K or e an .
O h , I have a run n y no se . . .
I c ook ed f ri ed ve g e t able s with ch ic k en to day .
I f ri ed ch ic k en and sea s on it with sweet s a ke .
And then , I f ri ed ve g e t able to g e ther .
It was very ha p p y when I can c ook well .
Let me in t ro d us e myself . .
He ll o ? my name is M ash a / I am 1 8 year s old .
B e c a us e I have to finish se v r al re p or t s and mi d ter m re po t for the s is .
In addition I have ex a m . . . .
A l m o st I am d y ing . . . . .
A fter the se bu s y day , I have two month s S p r ing V a c ation ! !
I will work at school , but most time I am free .
I am p l an ing to tra ve l , sh op p ing , read a b ook what ever I want and watch f il m s and see my friend s .
B y a c c id ent I was b or n as a J a p an e se woman . . .
people can go a b ro ad or co m m un ic ate on the in ter ne t easily than ever .
However , as every on e know s , there still are so many people who are in poor live s . . .
in other w or d s only small part of people can own person al comp ut er and co m m un ic ate with people all over the world .
And act u ally , this fact is somewhat quiet strange for me . . .
the di f f er ence between ri ch and poor is most ly b as ed just on in which country they were b or n !
I was b or n as a J a p an e se but if , I had been b or n in a poor n ation , my life would have change d comp le te ly .
But I know there is no `` if `` in hu man life , we c a n ' t nothing but live our own live s . . .
as some on e said `` don t think too much about things that can t be change d . ``
O h I just c a n ' t help to f a ll in l o ve with this f ant a st ic world .
I living in a small is l and country and it see m s not so many people sha re my ent h us i as m about star t re k stuff .
The last ed star t re k mo v i e is about c a p tain K ir k and S p ock .
But it ' s t at o l ly w or th y . . . . .
The place I live d is a w ar m c ity .
But the se days the c l im ate is get ting co l d ra p id ly .
M an y people prefer w ar m than co l d and I consider myself the most re s o l ut e one among them .
In this co l d days , I just want to stay at home : home and dr y , was there anything better than that ?
U n f or t un ate ly , I got co l d last night .
He ad a ch e , no se c l o g ed and ch o g h , I ha te them ! ! ! !
M a y b e I will be he al ed after a sweet y dr e a m .
To day , I went s w im m ing and at e an ic e c re a m after work .
I s w a m too hard so I was ex ha ust ed .
It ' s quite f un .
This me n k o c ar d ' H ar m of B u il d ing ' is as s um ed print ed in 1 93 0 ' s .
I can dis ting u ish print ed er a by qu al it i y of paper , print ing and them es .
F ir st , it ' s very di f f ic ut to find me n k o c ar d print ed in m ul t i - co l or in 1 9 2 0 ' s or e ar l i er .
S e c on d , this could n ' t be in e ar ly 1 94 0 ' s because them e nothing to do with mi l it al ies could n ' t be all ow ed d ur ing W W I I .
This could n ' t be in la ter 1 94 0 ' s because qu al ity of paper and print ing of this me n k o c ar d is too good for that er a .
T h ir d , the po s s i b i il t ies print ed in 1 9 5 0 ' s or la ter ?
B u il d ing s were not a ic on at that time .
B o y l o ve s something sp e c i al in all the time .
So , I con l ud ed this me n k o ' H ar m of B u il d ing ' was print ed in 1 93 0 ' s .
In the se days , kid ' s c a n ' t have the se kind of ' d y st op i a ' to y s .
That ' s the reason I l o ve me n k o !
It was ra in y day .
We put up to g e ther an um b re ll a .

A bout the time when even ing , we went to the ' S h in ch on ' .
' S h in ch on ' is called as `` street of you th `` .
There are many `` you th `` people .
We was one of them .
We had a dinner .
We at e a f o o d made from f l o ur .
We were full so took a walk .
I am being in L o s A ng el es .
No w , it is 7 : 37 am .

It not mean s I do n ' t like them , just I am not interest ed with the con t ent s they talk about .
H ence , I feel b or ed , when I hand out with them .
I enjoy the time when I was j o in ing the English con ver s ation c l u b .
It not only im p ro ve s my speak ing , but also a b s or b s some c ul ture about the un it ed state s .
A ll of them are great ly sp en d ing time .
L on g time no see
I did n ' t po st any j o un al last se m est er .
My s um m er ho l i day will end at next M on day , so I need to go back to school .
( I was very dis a p po in ted that my last di ar y has no commen t .
There f or e for the time being , I would like to keep my p r a c t ic e to e ng l ish di ar y )
To day , I would like to talk about my a ng ry to my man age r in work place .
I work for ex p or t and im p or t comp an y and I have been work ing in this office for 3 year s .
And he has been work ing here around 1 3 y e ar s .
O ur comp an y us ed to have me m b er s of 9 people but now we con s is t of only 3 me m b er s .
I am get ting not ic e my man age r ' s st up id ity and he give me a re al i z ing that I c a n ' t be a such a st up id person when I am a sen i or in the future .
And I think , We could n ' t see n his ability before d u e to it has been co ver ed up to other people .
He like s to sh if t some on e his work respon s i b il ity .
He c a n ' t de c id e anything and he always need to make the way of his es c a pe from any sit u ation .
He always p re ten d that I know the everything .
He us ed to speak the ne g at ive position even when we talk ing about j o ke s .
I am not great but his at t at ud e is dis g ust ting to work and I just need to talk the place to e a se the str es s .
Some on e told that it will help s to have good e ng l ish speak ing s k i ll s when you fight some on e .
C on g r at ul ation s on your gradua tion !

On my way to school , the ra in change d into dr i v ing s n ow .
A ll gradua te s entered high school as se m b ly ha ll and they sat down their sea t s .
The most impress ive thing was that girl ' s gradua te ' s me s s age to all students .
G r ad u ate ' s p ar ent s were listen ing her story with tea r s in their eyes .
She said she had be l on g ed to v o ll e y b a ll c l u b .
F in ally , they could take part in the v o ll e y b a ll game and they had ex pe ri ence d v ic t or ies and de f e at s .
I believe it ' s ex pe ri ence was great t re as ur e and she ' ll never for g e t her wonder ful me m or y for re st of her life .
My d aught er also got great t re as ur es and me m or ies .

The v is a of In d i a
To day I a p p l i ed to the con s ul ate for a v is a of In d i a .
I have been in C ha ng ch un serve r al days .
I saw an b r ow n a d ul t s an ke di ed be s id e a big b an an a f i el d .
D ad told me it had no po is on because it s head was n ' t tri an g le .
That re m in d ed me when I was a kid . . . . .
It has been a long time since I saw s n a ke at the first time .
I still re m e m b er when I was a e le ment ar y st ud ent , I saw a di ed U m b re ll a s n a ke [ B un g ar us m ul t ic in c t us , ( B ly th ) ] .
That ' s my first time so close to a po is on ous s n a ke , al th ough t it already di ed .
My da d also told me l ot s of his ex pe ri ence s about s n a ke s .
When he was a kid , he re g ul ar ly to catch s n a ke s .
If the s n a ke is po is on ous , he hi t unti l it is di ed and play with it for f un .
O r he might catch a s an ke without po is on , k il led and at e it .
He said he c aught a no n - po is on ous s n a ke to school , the s n a ke is re ally big , and he was c aught by his teacher , and the re s ul t was he was hi t s ever e ly by his teacher .
I asked him why he did that ?
He said , he was a kid of never afraid , did everything for f un .
But , he was a man now , and he would never do the se things again .
I gue s s that ' s because I le ar n ed one thing from this ex pe ri ence .
When people gr ow up , they will gradua l ly for g e t their in st in c t s or afraid of try ing new things .
ra in y sea s on .
In J a p an , ra in y sea s on finish ed yesterday .
I of ten us e mo ter c y c le , and ra in p re v ent me to dr ive .
My English s k i ll is poor , so please who ever con ta c t me , if you can help my English . ( ^ _ ^ ) /
One of my favor ite an im es is `` D e t ro it me t al c ity ``
D e t ro it me t al c ity ( D M C ) is story about m us ic i an , N e g ish i .
But after all , he ' s s ing ing in de a th me t al b and , D e t ro it me t al c ity .
He always make a comp la in about his b and , and he is always try ing to qu it the b and .
And , D M C has w il d f an s .
U s u ally he is re ally kind and n a ive guy , but when he is in D M C , he is an e v il .
This ga p make this an im e funny .
No w It ' s f ri day night in J a p an !
I want ed to go out for dr in k some where , but I am at house .
I will watch D V D `` 2 0 1 2 `` from now .
The di ar y is written for the first time .
I think that I become a c c ust ome d to English on this sit e because it is not good at English .
It works hard that the translation machi ne is not us ed as much as possible .
P le a se c he c k that sen t ence are c or re c t .
She is l ow er he i g h t .
So she is called her friend s ' b a b y ~ ! '
And she has big eyes , dark co l or ha ir and s k in n y body .
I have wait ed her in front of her class .
So , we could me t after finish ing her class .
And we talk ed about each other with sit ting on be n ch near by there .
So on , we went her do r m it o ty .
I could make more friend s because there are many her friend s .
And she and I ar ri v ed at her room and st ud i ed K or e an .
But It is hard time to explain her question s because I c a n ' t speak English very well .
Besides her question is so difficult to explain in English .
And we went b a se ment .
S ur p ri s ing ly , there were a b i ll i ar d t able , comp ut er s , so f as , T V and he al th train ing machi ne s .
The more we sp en d time , the more we close each other .
We had a p l an to go to H an - R ive r next t u e se day .
S n ow and ch er ry b l o s s o m
We had a little s n ow in this e ar ly morning .
There were a little ch er ry b l o s s o m s yet .
My hu s b and want ed to take some picture s for s n ow and ch er ry b l o s s o m to g e ther .
T h o se picture s might have been very beautiful .
But the y a h o o in ter ne t s er v ic e p re v ent ed him from his ho pe re al is ing .
That s er v ic e did n ' t work when he us ed his P C .
So , he had to re st or e it im m ed i ate ly .
The s n ow me l ted soon .
I s el d o m bu y s ing le C D s of J a p an e se p op m us ic .
The A ut um n to m m or ow . . .
I like the a ut um n .
But s um m er like more . . .
I want 9 0 more days of s un . . .
I ' d l o ve to play p i an o and tru m pe t , but I have no time to play them re c ent ly .
I w an n a im p ro ve my English s k i ll .
B e c as u e I w an n a co m m ut ic ate with a l ot of for e i g n er s .
C o m m un ic ation among the different c ul ture or different country is interest ing .
So , we can get much idea s , im f or m ation , know led g e , and so on .
F ro m now on , I ho pe I will gr ow with you .
I ' m not history bu f f , so I did n ' t know about the black S ept e m b er or those ter ro ri s m s .
In addition , I have no idea about J e w s or such kind of ra c is m neither .
I wish I would have had those know led g e more , and it made me be interest ed in those is s u es .
In middle e a st and e a st E ur o pe , the se e th n ic pro ble m are still there , are n ' t they ?
I must do a l ot of home w or k and re p or t s !
W at ch ing T V or D V D ,
However , what I must do make me re ally ha p p y in the future .
If I do it , I can feel a sen se of a ch i e ve ment .
A l m o st hu man s want to get away of what they have to do ,
If I can finish it , I can have a more great time to do what I do n ' t have to do ( I w an n a do ) than I did n ' t finish it .
I will think pro c ed ur e for my a ction pro f ound ly !
to day is We d ne s day , N e w Y e ar draw ing near , N e w Y e ar and V al ent in e ' s D a y this year , the same day .
My co ll e a gue to night ' s p la ne to tra ve l , how ha p p y , I also want to tra ve l , but I do n ' t speak English and no money , o h go d , why are there so many language s in the world , D o not us e the same language ?
I also like B e i j ing G u o ' an and like D ar k o M at ic .
I have four so c c er s c ar ve s , B e i j ing G u o ' an F C , M an ch est er United , B ir m ing ha m F C and B e i j ing B a x i F C .
But I los t M an ch est er United s c ar ve s in T i an j in ! ! ! ! !
The character s ' person al ity is from their n ation al ity and c ust o m s .
The strong country are usual ly a man or p ow er ful woman .

The en m ity of op i um with C h in a ; The de ta ch ment with A m er ic a ; A l way s fight with F r ance since big in ing . . .
It ' s very interest ing and it made you understand the history and g e o g r a p h y of the world , a l ot of different things in different country .
I l o ve A P H ! And T a i w an is a c ut e girl .
Some on e who have saw that a o m ic , you can talk with me about it .
But I can not for e i g n language . . . .
If I can speak English , K or e an , C h in e se , , , , , I will have a l ot of friend s .
U n t il last week en d , one of previous ten ant s had live d with me , but my friend mo v ed into the house last S un day ! !
A c t u ally , she have to go back to J a p an at the end of A u g ust , but I want to enjoy a l ot unti l then .
L a st week en d s was bu s y .
I need ed to go sh op p ing , do l and ri es , and visit my friend .
I did not think I was able to eat it that is as good as one s in J a p an !
She ga ve me some a d v ic es .
If I re ally do what I want , I should study much hard er than now .
M a y b e it is so hard that I a c c o m m p l ish it , though I do it .
However , she said I might be able to do it , so I should tru st me and just do everything I can ! ! !
A re you f a m il i ar with Ka r a o ke ? ( W h i ch is better ?
Ka r a o ke is the place to s ing so ng s .
But , Ka r a o ke has some mean s .
It ' s too difficult to explain for me .
In the place , there are many bo x - ty pe room s .
In there , we are s ing .
I like to s ing a so ng with my friend s .
However , I ' m not good at to s ing .
In J a p an , many people like it .
F ro m ch il d to sen i or , a l ot of people go to Ka r a o ke .
In my c ity , there are many Ka r a o ke sh op s .
Ka r a o ke machi ne gra d es the so ng that he s an g .
I want to be good at s ing ing very much .
D o you like to s ing a so ng ?
I s there a place such as Ka r a o ke in your country ?
One of my a im of study ing English is to have a good command of English po etic express ion s .
B y the way , I like T an i k a w a S h un ta ro in J a p an e se po e t .
( I know it already have a good translation but I will do it by myself . )
I ' ve been le ar n ing hu la for ten month s though I ' ve never been to H a w a i i .
When I j o in ed the less on first time , it was very t ough . . .
B e c a us e I have to almost always be in a half - c ro u ch ing position .
A n y way , I ' ve been a d d ic ted to it and I ' ve been p r a c t ic ing very hard for the success of the ro ll o ut because it will be he l d on A u g ust 3 1 2 0 0 8 .
However , while I was sit ting up l ate , I at e too much .
( I at e two c up s of ri ce and two to a st s with ch o c l ate s .
And I dr un k c a f e or e . ) And I at e too much for l un ch to day . . .
I went to ra m en sh op with my friend , who is 2 year s old er than me .
And , in J a p an , old er one of ten pay s for both of two .
No o d le we i g h ted 3 5 0 g .
It was pretty y a m m y any way .
So my st o m a ch has been k il led a co up le of time s in the se 2 days .
P er ha p s you are look ing for J a p an e se t al ent ed ar ch ite c t s with over three year s of pro g re s s ive and ex pe ri ence in ar ch ite c ture school .
I am p ur s u ing ur b an re ne w al te ch n i qu es and l and s c a pe ar ch ite c ture s , and now I interest ed in the al g or i th m ic de s i g n .
My intention and ex pe ri ence provide d me b ro ad un i qu e v is ion for the new ar ch ite c ture f i el d in C h in a .
I gradua ted from Tokyo U n ive r s ity of the A r t s with Bachelor de g re e in ar ch ite c ture and I am study ing in M aster de g re e now .
So I po s se s s a strong s k i ll of v is u al express ion .
I was a b s ent from school for one year in 2 0 0 7 , I in s te ad I work ed full - time in the office of P rofessor A k ir a K ur y u ( C h i b a U n i v . ) in one year per i o d .
This ex pe ri ence provide d me with va l u able a b il it ies of the g en er al bu il d ing de s i g n pro ce s se s .
A d d i tion ally , in the J un A o k i office , I op er at ed R h in o ce ro s and have made va ri ous pro g re s s in different pro j e c t s such as as se m b ling natural co ll age s , and op er at ing 3 D f un d a ment al for m s with command in C A D .
I can us e te ch n ical know led g e with the found ation of s k i ll s to quick ly a d a p t to new te ch no l o g ies .
F or in st ance , since I had know n the us age of machi ne ry in a d v ance , I t aught my co ll e a gue s how to us e it .
F ro m the se work ex pe ri ence s , I re al i z ed the im p or t ance of the f un d a ment al s k i ll s and tea m w or k are ne ce s s ar y for ar ch ite c ture pro j e c t s , which help ed me a l ot for the next job in this f i el d .
I have strong co m m un ic ation s k i ll s to co ll a b or ate with tea m s and I am also able to be as s er t ive .
My ability to de l i b er ate about give n pro ble m s has all ow ed me to con s is t ent ly a ch i e ve go al s .
F or in st ance , at the P rofessor K ur y u ' s office , when we de s i g n ed the public ha ll , the go ver n ment and we re se ar ch ed the opinion of l o c al re s id ent s .
I a d d ed up the se opinion s an a ly t ic ally and in te g r at ed my propos al into the f in al re p or t .
This was agree d upon all me m b er s and we could a c c o m p l ish this pro j e c t with my propos al .
I am certain that my ex pe ri ence s and a b il it ies , which are re s ul ted in my we b p age , would con t ri b ut e to your pro j e c t s .
This week en d , I will go to N i i g at a for F U J I R O C K F E S T I V A L 2 0 1 0 .
I asked my friend to day , if it is possible that I will get a good mar k in English speak ing ex a m in ation , because I act u ally like to speak in English very much and I also enjoy to do so .
However , she was so serious and she said to me , I will never get one of the be st mar k because I make so many mistake s d ur ing the English con ver s ation s .
Then , I had to as k for myself , whether it is a good thing to be honest at all because her honest answer hu r ted me so much , even it is the fact what it is .
I know already ly ing is not a good thing , however , we some time s need to lie which is called ' a w h ite lie ' to co m f or t some body else .
B e ing honest is very difficult as well , but she tru st ed me to say it because she conc er n s me so much and honest ly .
So , I am very gr ate ful that she said to me something honest ly , so I can see my pro ble m more object ive ly .
I write a di ar y for the first time .
I have been study ing English because I want to le ar n it and to speak many people .
My friend s told me this sit e is good so I write : )
There are s ever al reason s read ing b ook s is good .
There are much i nformation in it .
F or ex amp le , s c i ence , litera ture , gr o b al , language , and so on .
In addition , you can im p ro ve your e m o tion .
The more you read b ook s , the more your e m o tion are im p ro ve .
I do n ' t have the reason . . .
D o you have your face b ook account ?
In fact , I got my face b ook account a b it a g o .
I think I ' m go n n a up d ate my face b ook .
( To day I up l o ad ed M t .
If you interest ed in it , let you access and friend request : )
and I ' m easily catch co l d s .
What I was surprise d is the direct or s of the dr a m a are ga y s even though it ' s ma in character s are all w ome n act ing ho us w ive s .
I ' ve thought that must be made by woman direct or s , any way it ' s a w es ome .
As consider ing the st or ies and mo o d of de s p er ate house w ive s , the dr a m a is f it to w ome n .
I ' d like to us e better express ion s and right w or d s .
To day , I w an n a think of study ing for e i g n language s .
S t ud ent s in public school have been st ud i ed English from 7 g r ad e in J a p an .
( but my k or e an is not good , still begin n er le ve l . )
M o st J a p an e se co ll e g e let their students study for e i g n language expect English .
We have to take other language s class . )
I want ed to study K or e an at my co ll e g e but un f or t un ate ly my co ll e g e does n ' t off er K or e an class , so I took F re n ch class .
A c t u ally I do n ' t like study F re n ch because I ' m not so interest ed in F r ance from the out se t and I took it against my will because I had to ch o o se one from my co ll e g e ' s off er .
I ' m not f l u ent all language s but I ' m interest ed in other language s .
H a ve you ever had this feel ing like me ?
My mo m said it ' s not good for me and she suggest ed me I should study other language before I m aster one .
I agree with my mo m indeed , but how do I de al with my de s ir es .
How do you think about this is s u e ?
If you are o k a y , please answer my question s .
P ro b ably , almost J a p an e se students are t aught that some time s `` were `` is us ed to sub j un c t ive mo o d .
If I were ri ch , I could bu y what ever I want .
However my teacher told me that almost A m er ic an do n ' t us e it .
I think that all language is change able every minute but I ' m con f us ed .
D o you us e `` were `` to sub j un c t ive mo o d ?
I ha te ex a m in ation .
When I was a ch ir d , I was very well it .
But I can not it now .
A fter school ch ir d re n p r a c t ic e it every day .
They are very well .
I should give one s el f str e ng th more .
he ll o , I ' m new me m b er .
I want to study e ng h l ish so I want to make friend with er y on e .
To day I went to e y e c l in ic for c he c k ing my eyes .
L a st day , I was op er at ed on my short s i g h ted eyes .
My p ow er of v is ion in c re as ed 2 . 0 from 0 . 1 , it ' s in c r ed i ble !
V i e w from train was very clear just like p h ot o g r a p h take n by di g it al came r a .
I was surprise d by re c ent me d ical te ch no l o g y .
G o o d b y e my g la s se s , than k s for so many year s .
I want ed to watch a f ant as y like `` H ar ry P ot ter `` yesterday , but the mo v i e I watch ed yesterday was a dark f ant as y and it had a little he a v y them e .
To day ' s mo v i e is re ally good .
It had a l ot of e le ment s a d ve n ture , th ri ll , c ut e c re a ture s , and so on .
I thought the t w in s were play ed by two person .
They had a b s o l ut e ly different character s .
I would like to in t ro d u ce my s el f .
I watch ed mo o v ies .
To day was my ho l i day .
So I went to mo o v i e the at er to watch mo o v i e .
I watch ed two mo o v ies because to day is first day that we can watch mo o v i e only 1 0 0 0 y en .
We usual y have to pay a b ut 2 0 0 0 yen .
I watch ed J a p an e se mo o v ies `` my de r ling is for e ing n er ' ' and `` No d ame can t ar b i re ' ' T h o se were funny and impress ed .
`` No d ame can ta b i re ' ' is one of my favor ite .
The m e is m us ic .
and st age is P ar is .
I re c o m m en d it .
I think all of you have already heard about the B r a z il i an c ar n i v al .
It is the most ant ic i p at ed ho l i day here once d ur ing four days in F e b r u ar y people n ation w id e are invite d to ce le b r ate j o y a ccord ing to their l o c al c ul ture .
They are or g an i z ed ar t is t ic gr o up s that p re p ar e perform ance s to be present ed in great p ar ad es , and there B r a z il i an s as well as to ur is t s de light in the me s m er i z ing dance and m us ic .
What ever ch o ic e may be , the c ar n i v al is a time to re ch ar g e the b at ter ies in or d er to face the year a head .
I s it possible to understand other people ' s pai n ?
I think we can im a g in e other people ' s pai n to us e our past ex pe ri ence .
F or ex amp le , we know that it ' s pai n ful when a b a ll hi t to my body f a st ly .
B e c a us e we le ar n that by ex pe ri en c ing that act u ally .
So when a b a ll hi t other people ' s body , I can im a g in e that pai n ful .
But I can only im a g in e that .
A b a ll do n ' t hi t to my body .
A b a ll hi t ting other people ' s body is not my ex pe ri ence .
So I c a n ' t understand .
How do you answer to this question ?
It is a ga r b age co ll e ction day this morning .
I feel ho pe less ! ! ! !
it ' s been a week now , no one , on one , is will ing to c or r c t my es s a y , I ' m so s ad .
When I got to my class bu il d ing , one of my A m er ic an be st friend s was c ry ing .
I asked what ' s wrong with her , and then she told me that she just got a te x t from her mo m about her gr and m a pass ed away .
I did n ' t know what am I suppose d to say to her .
I did n ' t come up with any w or d s which can make her feel better .
A fter the class over , I got a call from my J a p an e se friend .
He r bo y friend who started da ting only 3 days a g o d um p ed her .
P ro b ably saying nothing and listen ing her talk were be st way to make her feel better .
It is some time s re ally hard for me to think of what I should say when my friend s are having hard time .
Then I also looked up ' mi d d ling ' and could n ' t re ally see a di f f er ence between the de f in i tion s of the two .
I was laugh ed class ma te .
But I de c id ed to ch o o se to a ction than keep con f us ing in myself .
To day I went to sh op p ing with my mother and brother .
She came back after some month s , she work in another c ity and visit us one time each two or three month s .
We are in W in ter , and my brother did n ' t take his co at because in the morning it was s un n y .
He should had b r ing up his co at .
It ' s a happen ing when my ch il d h o o d .
When a st ud ent of middle school , T h ough I had see n my friend ' s father once in the bu s , I c a n ' t re c o g n i z e him .

She te x t me she would be l ate .
S in ce I have to make some pro g re s s in the writing s k i ll of English .
Yes ter day , I b ough t a new j a c ke t at on line .
It was quite c he e p .
So , I w or ri ed about the qu al ity unti l it de l ive r ed on this morning .
It ' s c l o ud y in s a p po ro , it see m s to begin to ra in .
It make s me be into some h ow no st al g ic feel ing s .
When some on e said to you `` N ic e to see you again , `` what do you re p ly ?
I am un ive r s ity st ud ent .
A g e is 1 9 .
I want to speak English , be c ous e my dr e a m is work ing f i re i g n country .
please help me with my English .
G ive me your a d v is e .
My big g est pro ble m in co ll e g e is that I get ex ha ust ed because I have a l ot of things to do .
In this life c y c le , my f at i gue a c c um ul ate s day by day .
In conc l us ion , I will take a re st in this s um m er va c ation , and re c o ver my v i g or .
I usual ly us e ex ce l by work ,
but my ex ce l le ve l is very poor , too . . .
I have tri ed to write about sp or t s , family , and mo v i e .
I have no idea to write the a b o ve to p ic s .
A l th ough , I have to sub m it it in this even ing .
I think what I write about the to p ic s are not good , such as r u b b ish like my le c ture r said .
What should I do to make a good writing ?
I ' m is B o y I ' m 2 1 , I ' m from to C h in a e se .
W ant to know some friend s in this !
It has been about 4 month s since I did it the last time .
The d ent is t told me that I do n ' t have c a v it ies as ever .
I some time s for g e t or f a il to b r us h my te e th , but I have had no c a v it ies since I began to go there and get re m o v ed my t ar t ar on a re g ul ar b as is .
The d ent is t and as s is t ant s always man age d to find a way of re la x ing ch il d re n .
F or ex amp le , they put a T V in front of the p at i ent ' s cha ir and play the D V D of ' To m & J er ry ' while the ch il d is ex a m in ed .
I ' m afraid that the p ar ent s con f us e To m ' s sh ri e k with their ch il d ' s .
I heard an am b ul ance s ir en and the s ir en stop ed it soon .
I went outside and saw the am b ul ance stop ed at the con d o m in i um near here .
A fter a while , ( may b e in 2 0 minute s ) , I went outside and not ic ed the am b ul ance was still there .
L e ar n ing a for e i g n language was one of the most difficult yet most re w ar d ing ex pe ri ence s of my life .
So since I entered un ive r s ity , I have always been ing listen ing re al voice
The P e ng u in s of M ad a g as c ar is my favor ite c ar t o on , and I le ar n al ot from it .
my ta s k at work was finish ed this year and c le an ed up around
so I was so tired .
I went for w ed d ing work on s ut er day .
There were 5 co up le s w ed d ing .
so I had a me d ic in e and s l ept e ar ly .
Then I went to S h i g a for help ing ch or al so c a i e ty ' s re g ul ar conc er t yesterday .
I felt a little ten se when I read a con g r at ul at or y me s se g e .
since I was bu s y 2 days , I went to `` sen t o `` to day !
I feel so re la x .
I think `` sen t o `` is n ic e c ul ture .
I return to my home .
I go es to T ha il and 6 days a g o and I ar ri v ed on So u th K or e a yesterday .
when I ar ri v ed T ha il and , I could not b re a th because T ha i ' s te m p er a ture was over 4 0 C but I had p re c i ous time in T ha il and .
I could feel that T ha i people are very kind and they have a po s it ive mind .
there are very beautiful place and many de l ic i ous f o o d which is very e c on o m ical .
some time s I got into a ' T u k T u k ' which is T ha i ' s tra n s p or t ation .
It j o g g le s he a v y but very f un and T ha i ' s M c D on al d ma s c ot mo tion is different from other country .
I had a great time from T ha il and and I never for g e t for T ha il and tra ve l .
I at ta ch the p h ot o in T ha il and and all p h ot o were take n by my f il m came r a ( K on ic a p op ) .
D o you believe a re in c ar n ation ?
She is one of the person who believe a re in c ar n ation .
It was a w h ite do g and my mother l o v ed it so much .
However , it was 8 year s old , it got sick .
She was w or ri ed about it and took care of it very hard , but it di ed .
O f course all of us felt s ad and c ri ed , because we l o v ed it so much .
My mother es pe c i ally felt too s ad and she said to the do g ' s de ad body `` If you will be able to re b or n , you should be a hu man ' s b a b y next time . ``
A fter 2 0 year s la ter , I ga ve b ir th my d aught er and my mother was very glad about that .
And she asked my d aught er `` D o you re m e m b er this ? ``
When I looked at it , I was too sh ock ed because it was the b ow l which our do g had us ed before .
O f course my d aught er was up se t and could n ' t understand what she mean t .
There f or e she started to explain about the b ow l `` It was the b ow l which you were my do g before , I have want ed to me e t you as a hu man being for a long time .
and D o n ' t you re m e m b er that b ow l ? ``
My d aught er answered `` I do n ' t re m e m b er well .
When she heard my d aught er ' s answer , she seemed to be dis a p po in t .
When I was in O k in a w a , I could see the c l o ud s different .
They looked like raise d in the s k y .
The sp ar se raise d c l o ud s in the s k y amp l if i ed the un c an n y at m o s p h er with t w in k ling star s .
It see m s like to me that nature was de f f er ent from those of big c it ies such as Tokyo .
There f or e our eyes were natural ly r ive ted on the in d i g en ous nature .
Even after so a k ing in the sea , the s un b e a m pro m p t ly e v a p or at ed our so g g y we ar s .
And it s original c ul ture en ri ch ed ha r m on y between hu man and nature .
O k in a w a has some re m o te is le s a ro ud it .
And I found myself to look at a c ar ri age to w ed by a water bu f f a ll o at one of the is le s .
A man on the c ar ri age was play ing a in st r a ment al un i qu e to o k in a w a with s ing ing O k in a w a so ng s .
I have just make n a de c is ion to part ic i p ate in in ter n ation al ex change .
I know my spoke n e ng l ish is not well that ' s why I ' m on here : ) will be great to find some body who know s e ng l ish very well and want s to le ar n r us s i an .
F or ex amp le , the number of the he in ous c ri m es like ho m ic id es has been in c re as ing and it ' s been get ting more difficult to get a job re c ent ly .
No t to me n tion , e c on o m ic c ri s is is still con t in u ing , which led to many b an k r up t c ies .
There are even s ever al a b us es by a p ar ent .
One of the reason s is the fact that more mother s get to go to work now than before .
In the future , I ' m sure hu man re l ation s will be we a k er than now .
The g i g ant ic e ar th qu a ke has str u c k To h o ku dis t ri c t in J a p an yesterday .
I did n ' t felt it at where I ' m living .
A t first , I could n ' t believe what I was saw ing on T V .
T s un a m i was s w e e p ing out co un t less c ar s and house s .
A l th ough I have some re l at ive s in To h o ku dis t ri c t , I c a n ' t get to u ch with them .
M an y of me m b er of my class will become 2 0 year s old .
If we become 2 0 year s old , we can dr in k al c o h o l and s m o ke in J a p an .
Some time s I ' m con f us ing and I c a n ' t man age to re p ly question s in English .
Some time s I c a n ' t follow the question s , some time s I c a n ' t ch o o se right w or d s .
The old m aster living in this house thought , `` B e a c us e of this s ud d en ra in , many people will come to b or r ow um b re ll as . ``
But if I l en d um b re ll as one after another , however many I may have I c a n ' t have enough .
So you receiv e visit or s and re f us e to l en d one s . `` And he went into a room .
Then To ku s u ke , who live d in the next town , ra n in and said , `` C o ul d you please l en d an um b re ll a . ``
Y ot ar o answered straight , `` If I l en d um b re ll as when ever I am asked , however many I may have I c a n ' t have enough .
I w o n ' t l en d you .
I have them on the corner of the she l f . `` U n d er st and ? ``
P le a se l en d your c at . ``
The man was am a z ed to he ar him , and went home .
A fter a while again , the m aster living on the street came in and said , `` E x c us e me .
I have things to talk with your m aster . ``
I ' m so ex cited and also ne v ous e to day , because this is the first time to l o d on L an g - 8 , and why I ' m ne v ous e is that my English is not very good , I c a n ' t speak with a for e i g n er even speak with my class m ate s .
The p ur p us e I a p p ly for this account is that I want to im p ro ve m y English and I want to make more friend s with people from all over the world .
I know there are many di f f ir ence s between the e aster n and the we s ter n c ul c ur e , I also want to le ar n about it .
So , I ho pe you can help me , and I ' ll be very ha p p y if I can be you friend s .
A h , I like hu m man b - bo x very much , if some one who has the same ho b b y as I have , we can co m m un ic at with each other .
I am very than k ful to L an g - 8 g i v ing us a co m m un ic at on p l at f or m .
I s he de ad or al ive ?
O s a m a b in l ad en
I ' m tak ing night class es after work at public school .
F or now , I en ro ll ed it for this 3 month s .
A fter this s es s ion , I ' ll consider whether I should keep up the class or not .
The class is O K so far , it ' s not difficult .
I went to temple to day w t i h my friend , D or a .
And both of us got the di v in e w or d , which were re ally bad .
A l th ough I told to her that `` J ust for g e t about it , it does n ' t matter `` .
I as k about both l o ve and study .
And the di v in e w or d said that `` D o n ' t go for w ar d . . .
That ' s re ally a u k w ar d .
I c a n ' t ha te my c ous in no matter what happen s
a f e w month s a g o I got an idea that how about b r ing my c ous in here .
you know , S pe a k ing English is also im p or t ant in k or e a .
act u ally we do n ' t speak English in our country .
but , when we try to get a job , we will be in a t est about English .
any way , when he just came here he had n ' t got his c ar so he us ed to b ur r ow my c ar .
some time s he want ed to dr ive my c ar when we go some where to g e ther .
he near ly k il led me three time s .
for ex amp le , we were on the high way he was dr i v ing 1 1 0 k m .
but he did n ' t watch in front of the c ar he was interest ed in some co w s which are out of the high way .
and he cross ed the middle line .
at that time a c ar was coming from op po s ite la ne .
but , he did n ' t know that ti l I s c re ame d out .
it was too da ng er ous .
there are even more st or ies I can say .
I think I already said to much .
we will talk about this la ter again
O ur middle d aught er was c ry ing when she f e ll as le e p yesterday .
My w if e or I need to take care of our you ng est d aught er , so she some time s has to sleep alone .
When she was c ry ing , I just finish ed put ting our you ng est d aught er to sleep , so I could come to her and take care of her .
I will present a so l u tion for a pro ble m in a te x t !
But the pro ble m is difficult for me !
No w I worry about what I want to do in my future , so I am de p re s s ed and conc ent r ate on study ing !
My present worry is what kind of job s is s u it able for me .
I not ic ed re c ent ly that I do n ' t like study ing alone , so re se ar ch er and p rofessor see m s un s u it able for me .
So I will work in a big name make r and make a p l an ing for new pro d u c t .
O r I will work in a b an k because I have a s k i ll for ma th and may b e us e it .
However I have much time for de c is ion , so I have to do what I have to do now .
T im e is run n ing !
So I try my be st to do what I can do now !
I am a st ud ent in un ive r s ity . I am 2 1 . I want to p r a c t is e my English .
So any on e who want s to le ar n C h in e se or can help me in my English le ve l may a d d I C Q number 437346934 or m s n me r n y _ ting @ hot m a il . co m . T h an k s ~
A l m o st all P e op le s said `` It ' s very us e ful and ex qu is ite ! ``
So I will ex er t to understand it .
My f a se b ook life or i g in at ed me from to day .
I ' ll be a co ll ed g e st ud ent after this s um m er ho l i day , which make me ex cited , full of pro ud and ho pe ful .
A b s o l ut e ly , co ll e g e life is a care er p re p ar ation .
A l th ough there are some body think that at ten d to co ll e g e just finish what their p ar ent s ho pe and get the di p l o m a , I think was te the time in co ll e g e to play comp ut er and so on is not a s m ar t idea .
L e ar n ing and p r a c t ic ing the s k i ll which we need in the future is the most es s ent i al things
A ll of us w an n a have a ha p p i ness life and a f a v o ur ite care er with high in c ome , so most of us want to at ten d to co ll e g e to re al i z e our dr e a m .
There f or e we should gra s p every second in the co ll e g e .
F ir st , I ' m sorry my poor English .
We have been ga ve hu g e s up p or t many co un t ri es .
T h an k you so much for your w ar m - heart ed ! !
I l o ve you , F ri en d s ! !
F or t un ate ly I did n ' t me e t hu g e sha k ing .
K e e p ~ ! ! ! keep ~ ~ ! ! !
Where there is will , there is a way !
F ro m now on , I de c id e to re m e b er some English v o c a b ul ar y every day .
I think the v o c a b ul ar y is the b a se of English .
I had been st ud i ed English at school in J a p an since I was in a j un i or - high school ti ll un ive r s ity , other w is e I c a n ' t speak English f l u ent ly .
It has been said J a p an e se education ' s serious pro ble m for a long time , and it was made by English teachers .
B e c a us e most of J a p an e se school ' s English teachers c a n ' t speak English f l u ent ly , so they c a n ' t tea ch English like a n at ive speak er .
O f course they has a good s k i ll for teaching , but I think the most im p or t ant as pe c t of English education is how to make a co m m un ic ation , because language is too l co m m un ic ation .
Even though J a p an e se students have been study ing English for 6 or 1 0 year s is school , they c a n ' t make a good re l ation s h i p between for e i g n er s for the s a ke of lack of speak ing s k i ll .
J a p an e se go ver n ment have en c o ur age d to im p ro ve English teacher ' s train ing for de c ad e .
The mi n is t ry of education have been try ing to e m p l o y for e i g n er English teacher in s te ad of J a p an e se teachers for raise a English education ' s qu al ity , other w is e it was hard ly f un ction in J a p an .
I go to be a ut y s al a on to change ha ir co l or .
my ha ir became b ri g h t and I like my new co l or .
but every my friend , even my f a m il i y
I do part time job at s up er m ar ke t .
yesterday , I got a high salary than I thought .
it make s me ha p p y but I want to e ar n more money .
I want to tra ve l A ust r al i a to see my friend .
I want to go a b ro ad !
I have a m us c le a ch e since I went 1 0 k m j o g g ing yesterday .
I should n ' t have tri ed to over d o : - (
Yes ter day ' s we a ther is c l o ud and s n ow .
I went to c a f e with my f re n d .
I eat de ri c i ous c a ke and dr in k tea .
U .
S S e c re ta ry of S t ate C l in t on visit ed J a p an .
When I was watch ing the piece of new s , I not ic ed a certain thing .
I know , of course , she seemed to try to speak clear ly and s l ow ly so the a ud i ence could comp re h en d what she mean t or want ed to say . . .
To im p ro ve listen ing s k i ll , her speak ing may be a good sub st it ut ive te x t b ook .
This is the th ir d time writing : ) As the ti t le say s , to day is my b ir th day and I became 2 1 age !
A n y way , my friend ga ve me piece s of c a ke and me s s age c ar d for me .
The c ar d said that keep good friend s h i p between us and she ho pe s I will have a good days .
I s w e ar myself that I will also make her ha p p y in her b ir th day .
I ' ve live in Tokyo since for a long time .
I have a question , if you go to Tokyo , where would you re c o m m en d to go ?
I ' m very tired and sleep y c u z I s l ept only 3 h o ur s last night .
I just finish ed class and next less on will start after 4 h o ur s .
unti l the class start I may sleep but I have to study tra f f ic r ul es to pass the ex a m . . . . .
re c ent ly there are no change in my life .
I want to go dr in k ing , play da n c ing , ten n is and many other thing .
mo v ing my l o c ation is trouble s ome for me .
but it see m s f un to live the place where I ' ve never been to .
any way I have many things to have to do .
first of all I try to go to be d .
To day was ex t re m ly n ic e day .
s un s h in e and we a ther like s sp r ing .
I re ally want to ha ng out with my friend s but I did n ' t .
B e c a us e of yesterday d ur ing play b a se b a ll in my b a se b a ll tea m ,
I hi t my face against other side tea m play er .
I was re ally hu r t .
and I get a black eyes .
I did n ' t want to show my face another people s .
So I was study English and watch ing `` L O S T `` ( A m er ic an D r a m a ) in my home .
D es p ite I did n ' t ha ng out with my friend s , I was ha p p y
I was so n er v ous from start to finish that my face got dr en ch ed with per s p ir ation ( I must ' ve looked u g l i er than usual . . . ) and some question s I had p re p ar ed for the in ter v i e w s l i p p ed my mind .
On my way home , I was already begin ing to give up on the job and de c id ed to go to the E m p l o y ment S er v ic e A g en c y tomorrow .
A l th ough what I de s p er ate ly want now is a full - time job , I op ted to accept the off er straight away .
I need to make a living after all .
A n y way , work ing part - time for a two month per i o d of pro b ation , the comp an y will see if I ' m s u it able for the position .
So , from now on , I have got to le ar n a l ot of te ch n ical terms for c l o th ing to tra n s l ate the comp an y ' s we b sit e and do c u ment s and so for th into English .
W o ul d any body tell me any help ful we b sit es to le ar n about the terms ?
my trouble about e ng l ish le ar n ing
U s ing sp ar e time , I have been st d u y ing e ng l ish in an in ter n ation al e ng l ish school since D e c , 2 0 0 7 .
but to my dis a p po in t ment , so far I found I have not had any o b v i ous pro g re s s es pe c i ally my listen ing s k i ll and or a .
though now I can read some e ng l ish ar t ic le s and write some simple ma il s in e ng l ish , it is still very difficult for me to co m m un ic ate with for e i g n er s in e ng l ish .
how to im p ro ve my e ng l ish listen ing le ve l in a short ter m ?
who would like to give me some us e ful a d v ic es ?
To day , when I s ur f ed we b s ite s , I found a j o ur n al .
I am going to tra n s l ate this .
He gradua ted from a high school which I gradua ted from .
In the So u ther n Ka n t o , there were only two D P J state s man who could re tain their sea t s in con st it u en c ies , Ka n N a ot o of M us ash in o C ity of Tokyo and No d a Y o s h i h i k o of F un a b ash i C ity of C h i b a .
This is a reason why he was consider ed as a new le ad er of D P J .
My near est ra il way st ation is l o c at ed in the b or d er between F un a b ash i and N ar ash in o C it ies .
M an y state s man are see n f re qu ent ly there , and No d a of ten speak s to v o ter s at the st ation in morning s .
I always v ot ed for him in e le ction s , but I know nothing about his po l ic ies , because he say nothing about them .
He le ar n ed po l it ic s in a f a m ous un ive r s ity , so he certain ly has a l ot of po l ic ies .
However , he does n ' t show v o ter s his po l ic ies clear ly , because po l ic ies make e ne m ies .
He e age r ly works for v o ter s , but o b v i ous ly , he does n ' t like talk about id e o l o g ical matter s .

I went to my English class .
O ur comp an y is had a get - to g e ther to day .
We at e ri b s of p or k .
It ' s de l ic i ous .
I am going to sleep .
I start L an g - 8
I S t ar t la ng 8 X D
I do n ' t know what I write to this .
But I try ing .
every body , P le a se help me when I need .
I wish W in ter coming f aster . . ^ ^
L a st year I started le ar ing s n ow board .
In my life for first time go to a s k ing gr ound .
A t the start just s k i but time pass 2 hour not interest .
C ha ng e s n ow board re ally f ant a st ic .
T a ke a s k i le ar n 1 h o ur just o . k , But s n ow b o ar d is very very difficult . and very interest ed .
F or the first time I bu y e qu i p ment .
In this time so hot we a ther I re ally mi s s w in ter .
E ver y th ing become to w h ite .
It was not so co m m on here in J a p an to change a job at least 2 0 year s a g o .
My first cha ng ing was that time .
However , to tell the tru th , I easily want ed to es c a pe from difficult pro ble m s .
When I face to such pro ble m s , I strong ly feel that it ' s a was ting time to keep on .
I ' m a p t to ho pe the great re s ul t s would come .
But great a ch i e ve ment s are original ly not o b tain ed easily .
As any on e ' s success is sh in ing b ri g h t ly , I just can find it .
It ' s a simple way , but difficult for me .
When I think it ' s im po s s i ble to the difficult pro ble m , it might turn out to be tru e .
I should qu it worry ing about the great f a il ur e and I should keep on do ing once if I have started it .
Some hold the view that it is do not need to in c r a se teacher ' s s al ar ies in or d er to the qu al ity of education , because they f ir m ly believe that the ma j or part of st ud ent education is the students themselves .
However , from my every day ex pe ri ence and o b s er v ation I can state s ever al fact or s to de f en d the state ment that in c re a se teacher ' s s al ar ies can im p ro ve the qu al ity of education .
F ir st , a well pai d o c c up ation can at t r a c t many people to be a teacher , it follow s that many people with do c t or ate will ing to be a p rofessor in un ive r s it ies .
It is no do u b t that a do c t or have more so p h is t ic at ed e u c ation al s k i ll s than a gradua te since he have more study and teacher ex pe ri ence s .
F or ex amp le , my school is just a a ver age co ll e g e , but it off er the teacher with a high salary .
In this case , the teachers in c ul d ing p rofessor s and teaching as s is t ant s are almost have a or two do c t or ate .
And thus the qu al ity of education in our un ive r s ity are im p ro ve sh ar p ly , as well as with a good re p ut ation .
S e c on d , in c re a se the teacher ' s salary can im s p i re them to do their be st .
It is the same reason just like any bo s s in c re as ing a e m p l o y e e ' s salary .
The teachers , are the one s that want to keep their salary in a st able st u ation , must sat is f y their students and the de an .
The need to p re p ar e their course in care ful , in t ro d u ce new and interest ing me th o d s to ed u c ate students .
In a w or d , in c re s ing the teacher ' s s al ar ies is the be st way to im p ro ve the qu al ity of education .
B e c a us e many qu al it i ed people will want to become teachers with a high salary and im s p i re them to do be st .
I work as P R for b a b y close comp an y .
I us ed to live d in F L and L A for for e i g n st ud ent .
F or the se day , I do n ' t have ch ance to speak and write in English , so this will be good op p or t un ity to keep the s k i ll for me .
I ho pe every on e will see this and c or re c t it .
M o st of J a p an e se do m est ic C o man ies have the five - day work w e e k s y s te m , and the ho l i day s are S at ur day and S un day .
The good point is that every where I go is not so many people .
The B ad point , However , is that I have an work on S at ur day .
M o st of my friend s has day off s on S at ur day and S un day ,
If you live in As i an co un t ri es , it ' d be e as i er to tri p to K or e a than those who does n ' t live in As i a .
It ' s act u ally been said that tri p to K or e a is c he a p er than do m est ic one .
If you only want to enjoy n ic e K or e an f o o d s , you not ne se s ar i ly have to go to K or e a .
B e c a us e there ' s always been so - called K or e an town in Tokyo ! !
I went to K or e an town and had re ally n ic e K or e an B B Q to n ite with my co ll e age s which re m in d ed me of visit ing K or e a for about two year s a g o !
Yes ter day I was too tired and went to be d e ar ly .
But because a friend sen d me a S M S told me he was sick .
I was worry about him and can not sleep well .
A h , ho pe that he will feel better soon .
Yes ter day , I read a J a p an e se co m ic b ook ( M A N G A ) the ti t le is `` G A K U `` .
`` G A K U `` is a story of mo un tain re s c u e me m b er his name is `` S A N P O `` .
`` S A N P O `` is a very strong c l im b er who had c l im b ed many f a m ous mo un tain s in the world .
But his most a d v ant age is kind ness .
He has never s c o l d ed to care less ness c l im b er s .
On the con t r ar y , he said to them `` You did your be st .
When you ' ll be fine , let come back mo un tain s again ! ``
I ar g u ment with my w if e because of small di f f er ence s between us .
I wish I want to be like him .
I ' d like to en c o ur age in English when my students do their home w or k .
What can ( should ) I say for them ?
I ' m very ha p p y if you give me some idea s .
T h o se who do n ' t know this dis e a se may feel f ri g h ten just to he ar , but it ' s one of the s k in dis e as es that ch il d re n of ten s u f f er from .
This dis e a se cause s re d ra s he s on hand s , f o ot s , a mouth and even on a as s .
He got many ra s he s and a high f ever .
No w he ' s get ting better , but I feel re a ll sorry to see my so n ' s body full of the ra s he s .
I study English about 8 year s a g o .
My f a v ar ite mo v i e is `` The de v il we ar the P R A D A ``
To m or r ow , I ' m going to ha ir c ut .
A re the se sen t ence s c or re c t ?
P er f or m er s are R o b er t G la s p er E x pe ri ment .
They are one of the most c re at ive m us ic i an s in the se days , ma k ing their original m us ic b as ed on J a z z and H i p H op .
I was re ally mo v ed by their play , so I am look ing for w ar d to listen ing to their live m us ic soon again .
I know this we b s ite from one of my friend s ,
she us e this to im p ro ve her j a p an e se , and also make friend s .
she told me that I can p r a c t ic e e ng l ish at here
my name is U n a , I get trouble in e ng l ish , I re ally want to im p ro ve it .
c or re c ting my poor e ng l ish will take s you a l ot s time , I ho pe you do n ' t mind .
It is tru e hu n ting w ha le s is j a p an e se tra d ish ion .
B e f or e see ing this mo v i e , I would never feel like that because eat ing w ha le is j a p an e se old c ust o m and tra d ish ion like f re n ch eat ra b b it s and f l o g s , es c ar g o s .
F ish er man and their f a m il ies are than k ful for w ha le .
And they p re y for the w ha le and they have f est i v al for a p p re c a ite to the w ha le .
It is not easy for every on e to k i ll the A N Y an im al for eat ing , they hu n t the w ha le with hard pai n for their life , that is e ar n ing money .
They co ver the b l u e sea t a b o ve the sea not to show k il ling w ha le s after the mo v i e was b ro ad c as ted because they think the scene of di e should not be show n like hu man being does n ' t show their face to all people when they di e .
F ish er man do n ' t b re a k the any in ter n ation al law .
What right do S e a she p ar d have to c ri te c i z e them person ally .
They should c ri te s i z e the hu n ting to the w ha le in it s el f in right way .
They just make fish er man a ng ry by tak ing p h ot o s and v id e o s with per s is t ence and they get the scene fish er man is ma d at them .
It is de f in ate ly un f a ir .
What do you think about the hu n ting w ha le ? ?
In J a p an there are not a f e w c ock ro a ch living .
They are so s c ar y that even a sight of one make s me th i ri ll .
3 y e ar s a g o not less than 4 co c ro a ch es appeared in my room at the same time .
My s k in became it ch y and t un ed re d .
In se c t ic id e is strong .
The most things I like
R is k and new things are the most things I like .
N e w things always f as c in at ed me .
I think every change s have the reason s and some time s , the change s help me gr ow up .
I like the ri s k because may be when I ri s k I can ex p l or e your own ability .
the life that you can see the life is wonder ful .
This is the in ter ne t to make it possible to in te g r ate hu man in t el i g ence over the world .
However there are 2 people , who po st the i nformation s on the ne t and who us e the i nformation on the ne t .
me also .
So I wonder who give the commen t on this da i a ly .
My you ng est d aught er w o ke me up and asked tak ing her down to the living room in the morning .
I want ed to sleep more , but I ch o o se not to sleep again and did some work .
There were many people in there because it ' s H i g an in J a p an .
We at e l ate l un ch at a re st a ur ant near the st ation .
When we went back home ; I was ent er ing my house , my you ng est d aught er want ed to play at the ga r d en in front of my house .
There f or e I we ed ed a ga r d en while she was play ing .
It was a or d in ar y day , but I think I had a good day .
I went to G un s and R o se s conc er t in Tokyo D ome last night .
The sound effect was me s s ed up !
P ro b ably , it is because of the sea t are a where I was .
I gue s s the speak er s y s te m could not co ver up to the are a .
In addition to , it was too co l d in the ve n u e and so on . . .
A n y way , I was ha p p y to he ar f a m ous t un es from the past al b um s .
To day , I started to be l on g English school .
It ' s style is that students talk to a teacher living in P h il i p p in es by s k y pe p h on e ( I P te le p h on e ) .
It ' s co st 5 0 0 0 yen .
It ' s very c he a p comp ar ed with normal English school .
I can he ar the teacher ' s voice clear ly , but I think it is difficult to understand what a teacher said by only voice .
I work ed hard without much success , because the to p ic was too difficult and compli c at ed to dis c ri b e .
The te x t b ook qu ot es from a l ot of paper s one after another , so I re ally con f us ed try ing to make sen se of the out line .
I could n ' t be sat is f i ed my present ation , I like dr in k ing after every effort no ne the less ^ ^
I want to do better work next time .
A hu g e job hu n ting even t will be he l d in this week en d at a large con ve n tion ha ll in Tokyo .
So I made re s er v ation s for a over night bu s and hotel .
I was too l ate to make re s er v ation s , so it was very difficult to find them , es pe c i ally over night bu s .
As for hotel , I ' ll stay at a hotel which has hot springs .
However , I can stay there with reason able p ri ce .
I ' m look ing for w ar d to visit there .
And I ho pe I ' ll be able to get high er mo t i v ation through this even t .
To day , I could n ' t explain a B ri t ish why T O E I C is more f a m ous than I E L T S .
I said `` T O E I C is ma in ex a m in ation in J a p an , so many sh op s have got a l ot of T O E I C te x t b ook , a f e w I E L T S . ``
I ' ve had difficult y es pe c i ally in writing , because there were n ' t proper fee d b a c k s on my writing s .
And I am also want to help the person who wish to le ar n K or e an .
He ll o ! E ver y body !
to day in t ro d u ction about me ! ! !
living in j a p an .
and my job is re s id ent n ur se in j a p an .
my dr e a m is in ter n ation al n ur se ! so do my be st ! !
please help me a my e ng l ish ! ! !
if you w an n a study a j a p an e se , I can tea ch you a j a p an e se ! ! !
but I am not look sea .
I want to go to see the sea .
No w , J a p an is in the c ri t ical sit u ation .
I think sp o il ing ra d i o a c t ive water to the sea is c at a st ro p he .
There might be no ch o ic e about that but I c a n ' t understand why they did that .
M a y b e if they did n ' t , the p ow er p l ant ex p l o d ed ? ?
What is w or se is J a p an e se go ver n ment is try ing to con t ro l i nformation in this in ter ne t age .
And I knew many people are worry ing about it .
I re ally a p p re c i at ed that .
But I re ally want to know what for e i g n people are think ing about this sit u ation of J a p an .
C h in e se is so f an .
J a p an e se also us e Ka n j i , so I think it ' s a little easy for J a p an e se to re m e m b er C h in e se w or d s .
But it ' s difficult to pro no un ce and to he ar .
It take s long time for re m e m b er ing English w or d s , but I of ten found out mean of a C h in e se w or d which I do n ' t know only to see .
To day , after C h in e se class , my teacher told me to come to the teacher ' s desk .
I thought `` did I something bad . . . ? ``
But he said `` You do study so hard , but your pro n un c i ation is a little in c or re c t , I ' ll tea ch you . ``
S ound s you ' ve had good days in A f ri c a ! !
I ' ll sen d you the g if t on and off if it make s you ha p p y : D
You think I ' m so kind guy , do n ' t you ? ! !
H o pe you ' ll have b ri ll i ant ex pe ri ence s in there ! !
It is a b it difficult to play f ut s al for me , so a f ut s al co ur t is narrow .
That is why I have to le ar n s k i ll mo ve s in which I ' m second to no ne .
Let ' s play f ut s al with me ! !
My 5 - month - old d aught er f in ally got to be able to turn her s el f over to day !
She just can turn to her right side and lie on her t um m y , but she c a n ' t turn back over .
Q ing D a o - My second home t ow n
R i g h t who give me a family .
So many people like here because it has a long o ce an line be s id e the H u an g o ce an .
when s um m er coming the te m p er a ture will not hi g er
No w the w in ter come .
I feel very co l d .
the w in d is very big .
I los e my um b re ll a yesterday .
It ' s a very bad new s , because I am live in the ra in y c ity .
I need a big um b er ll a a v o id to be a we t people .
A fter f e w days , I think I should go to bu y a new one .
Even I still want my um b re ll a back to me . . .
What I had been request ed by the c l i ent was the follow ing ;
To make it like a ble ar y picture .
To f o c us on some part s but not all of it .
B as ic ally I always listen to all the request s from a c l i ent and try my be st to a ch i e ve the go al ex a c t ly the way the c l i ent im a g in es on her mind .
However , this time the c l i ent was very str ic t about the who le la y o ut in de ta il , because they themselves take care of their own c l i ent s ' ha ir style every day and are natural ly ke en on how the be a ut y is suppose d to be .
It took us the e month s to comp le te it and we , our de s i g n er s , co d er s and I , have just made it and I ' ve felt very re l i e v ed to finish it !
C h er ry b l o s s o m is s ur p ri s ing . . .
What a co l d day is it ! !
It was very t ough game .
I thought it get s w ar m enough to play ten n is without feel ing co l d .
I went to my C h in e se st ud ent ' s home to have supper .
We went to s up er mar ke t and b ough t some f o o d s for supper .
It was very good p r a c t ic e for me to speak English .
The se days , I have a l ot of time to speak E n h l ish .
I ch i ro A ch i e v ed 2 0 0 S a f e H it s
I ch i ro , who play ing S e at t le M ar in er s in M a j or L e a gue , a ch i e v ed 2 0 0 s a f e hi t s con t in u ing 1 0 year s .
It was 1 5 2 th game of him , that is 1 0 days la ter than last year .
The great re c or d do n ' t a ch i e v ed any other him .
No w , he is a star play er in M a j or L e a gue ! !
I ' m pro ud of his success as the same J a p an e se .
F or in st ance I did n ' t le ar n w or d s about B a se b a ll .
Yes ter day we a ther was very n ic e and the s un s h in e was also too strong in the day time .
I had been teaching so c c er to kid s for the morning of yesterday .
As a re s ul t , I got s un b ur n ed ex c ept my body and le g s .
In sp ite of having got ten s un b ur n ed too much , when I got up this morning , I did n ' t feel pai n of my s k in at all .
A l th ough I went to be d at the previous night , it ' s not like ly that the f at i gue of my body re c o ver ed well .
A t ten d e es ex c ept me were p rofessor s and man age r s from big comp an ies .
I want to go to On s en if I have enough time tomorrow .
The ra in y sea s on is coming !
But , we do n ' t have a l ot of ra in in this sea s on , so the water s up p ly through o ut the c ity will start from J un e 1 2 . . .
so we c a n ' t us e water from 1 1 : 0 0 p . m . to 6 : 0 0 a . m . ! !
I do n ' t like to ri d e a b i ke on ra in y day , but I c a n ' t stand that I c a n ' t us e water ( ; _ ; ) So I ho pe that we will have a he a v y ra in !
I ' m so b ro ke just now . . .
so I have to find another part - time - job !
There ' re a l ot of things I w an n a do !
So I w an n a s a ve money !
I ' ll take a t est to m m or ow . . . .
so I have to study !
It has been little long time .
He y how are u do ing , guy s ?
I m do ing bad .
I m f al le n to as le e p almost time when I study English after come back home from work .
It ' s s u c k s .
I have T O E I C t est in next month .
How should I do ( that ? ) not to be f al le n to as le e p ?
only good new s is I might get a dr i v ing l ic en se at least next week en d .
my English is get ting only w or se .
I have st ud ing English all the time at the l i b r ar y .
T ow ar d even ing ( 6 : 3 0 P M ) , I have been to le ar n English for a week
at S D A language school .
It ' s b or ed .
But I have ma x im um am o un t of effort to conc ent r ate my at ten tion .
o k un i w a di ch ir a de s u k a .
j a , n i h on g o o ha n ash im as u k a .
n i h on g o o ha n ash im as en .
de m o , ch ot t o e i g o o ha n ash im as u .
n an i w a ur im as u k a .
i ch in i ch i an at a no mi se n i ho o m on sh im as u .
He had got mar ri ed a year a g o .
O f course he in t ro d u c ed her .
We all had a long talk , you know , talk ing about the past , the present time , and of course , future pro j e c t s .
G o ing back to home , I thought she was the per f e c t w if e for R i ch ar d , so that he could man age his ter ri ble mo o d .
E at at home or O ut ?
I think your answer s should be like `` Yes , O f course `` .
C er tain ly , it ' s not easy to c ook a n ic e dis he s because c ook ing is a high te ch n i qu e job .
I s el d o m invite my friend s to eat at home because I am not con f id ent in my c ook ing s k i ll al th ough my friend s would not mind of it , or even a clear so up noodle s .
M a k ing a de l ic i ous f o o d is a high te ch n i qu e job because you need to know what kind of f o o d ma ter i al , too l , and re c i pe you need to p re p ar e and how to se le c t , us e f o o d ma ter i al and too l , and do a c ook ing .
In C h in a , there are th ous and s of f o o d ma ter i al and c ook ing me th o d s .
Even if the ma ter i al is the same , the ta s te may be va ri ant from different c ook ing me th o d s and different c he f s .
F or ex amp le , a fish can be made by f ry ing , s te a m ing , c ook ing or s al ting e t c .
The s up p le ment ar y ra w ma ter i al could be any kind of ve g e t able s or even C h in a T r ad i tion al M ed ic in es .
So , it is not easy to c ook such n ic e dis he s at home , if you invite a friend for a me al , I suggest you go to a re st a ur ant or a ch op h ous e .
F or a second consider ation of eat ing out , most C h in e se people would like eat out when invite friend s or hold ce le b r ation act i v it ies , such as b ir th day part y , re l ation s h i p bu il d ing part y .
In the se sit u ation , usual ly , there should be a ho st to pay the b i ll in turn at this time , the c ust o m is different from We s ter n ' s d ut ch treat .
F or this reason , it would be consider s ting y because you will sp en d less money on eat ing at home than re st a ur ant , or when your friend s invite you in re st a ur ant for a return or d er next time , you would feel like ow ing something .
F in ally , eat ing out can be consider ed con ve n i ent and s a ve more time to cha t or do other things .
E at ing out could be less one th ir d of the time than eat ing at home , that is , if tak ing twenty minute s in re st a ur ant would tak ing one hour at home .
A fter me al , eat ing out mean s no need to do was h ing dis he s and c le an ing work .
E s pe c i ally , when you invite a l ot of people for a me al , eat ing at home would be a very much cha ll e ng ing work .
It was such a hu g e work that I re m e m b er ed by now .
No w , in my home t ow n , many such part ies would be he l d in re st a ur ant for con ve n i ence and de l ic i ous ta st es .
C er tain ly , there are many reason s to s up p or t my view that eat ing out is more better than eat ing at home when you in v it ing friend s for a me al .
V er y very de l ic i ous ! !
But I worry about put on we i g h t . . .
I have to di e t . . .
I c ut my ha ir at be a ut y s al on .
I like this my ha ir s ty le .
H i , my first time di ar y : )
H i , Let me in t ro d u ce myself .
I do n ' t know what I should write di ar y , so I want to look ing back to day .
I got up about 8 o ' clock in the morning .
I ' ve been study ing English for a long time , but I c a n ' t speak English very well .
I s ur f the In ter ne t of c ook ing sit e yesterday .
I found some re c i pe s , they look so good ta s te .
one of them is l as a g n a .
I tri ed the l as a g ne dis h for the first time and it was de l ic i ous .
I have a b re ad make r so I k ne ad past a by machi n .
I made me at s a u ce and w h ite s a u ce .
I took the p h ot o after started eat ing .
If you find any er r or in w or d s , gra m m ar s , or l o g ic s , please c or re c t it .
O f course , if some st ud ent ' s ce ll p h on e r ing s d ur ing class , it both er s other students .
But it does n ' t mean that they must not b r ing the ce ll p h on es to school , because if they keep them off d ur ing class , there will be no pro ble m s .
My bo s s came to the comp an y to day .
us ul ly I must to know before she come s or not but to day she did not to tell me and e m p l o y e e in the office she be come to day .
I am eat ing like di ri c i al I am s er p ri z e she walk and look this way .
I must to keep my f o o d quite ly .
She t ul d me she want ed ch i ness tea .
I must to take care my bo s s because the w if e house she did not come to day .
I never to do that for her begin .
F ir st time I felt con f us e very must .
and In the after no on I asked her about the f o o d to bu y to her she said she can eat every thing or ri ce with s up e
after I head I hu r ry to b ough t the f o o d for her I can not find the f o o d she like it
she laugh t about f o o d
so you can im m a g in if you eat the same f o o d every day you will be bo re I think she felt but she do n ' t say .
I ' m ha p p y to w ite e ng l ish like the same day .
T a ke care
and after day if must re m e m b er do n ' t bu y ri ce with p or k for her .
He ll o , my wonder ful friend s to day is some on e b ir th day . .
I am so r r ry to made her go to be d l ate but I would like to tell her . .
`` H A P P Y B R I T H D A Y `` I just would like to say . .
we can help and sha re each other
in en ri ch our life a ng make our life be better
I visit this home p age first time .
So I in t ro d u ce myself .
I am J a p an e se and live in N a g o y a , the middle of J a p an .
I always co m m un ic ate T ha il and and In d i an c ust ome r by e m a il .
But I do n ' t have con f id ence to write what I think in the de ta il .
So I j o in this home p age .
And does any on e who speak s English f re qu ent ly make a friend with me ?
I was un b el i e v able .
it was my first time to watch the b a se b a ll game .
it ' s different J a p an e se .
loud l ough ing , loud re g re ting . .
any way , r ock ies came from behind v ic t or y .
To ry was very n ic e play er .
when T ro y came b at ter ' s bo x , made some no is e .
f in ally , he hi t the s ing le hi t , it made r ock ies w on .
I have a t est in F e b , but I ' m in the ar m y now , so do n ' t have enough time to study .
all of the people here , are you ng er t an me , after they finish a d ut y of d e p en se our country , they will go back to the un ive r s ity and keep study ing .
but I was already gradua ted from pe k ing un ive r s ity in ch in a , so I have to find a job , I ho pe that I will be a c er t if i ed public account ant and have to im p ro ve e ng l ish s k i ll s and ch in e se s k i ll s
I started it because I would like to have more op p or t un ity to speak English , and the on line le c ture s are c he a p !
If I go to a language school and talk with a n at ive speak er , it would co st more than 3 0 0 0 0 y en ( about $ 3 5 0 ) in a month , but the on line one co st just 3 0 0 0 y en ( about $ 3 5 ) per month .
My e m p l o y ment in a ch il d h o o d .
I was o c c up i ed by many de al s and am us e ment : G r a e c o - R o man w re st ling ( 1 y e ar ) ; k ar ate , bo x ing , f o ot b a ll ( f e w month s ) ; and my favor ite a ir - mo d el ling ( the some year s ) - it dr o ve me c r a z y and c ur r ent ly I l o ve a ir c r a f t s & any a ir machi ne ry .
A l s o , I like my home comp ut er , was study ing how it works and another te ch no l o g y .
When I was in my c ir c le of a ir - mo d el ling there is a c ir c le of ra d i o l o ver s .
I never mind how they sit on his p la se s and so l d er all time .
When I gr e w up I think about my pro f es s ion and after w ar d s I had finish ed my study at an un ive r s ity on a ra d i o f a c ul ty ! ) because I had entered in that f a c ul ty on a free education .
C ur r ent ly I work in a ra d i o in d ust ry like a j un i or e ng in e er and I so l d er almost all day in my job .
One day she want ed to go to S e o ul train st ation .
She c aught a tax i and said to the dr ive r .

I want to say some day `` I have been to me . ``
It was one of the ha p p ies t day two days a g o since I came in the U .

I ' ve never dr ive n a c ar in J a p an , even so , I ' ve never been in trouble

S t ud ent s normal ly start tak ing English class es as e ar ly as they are still in p re s ch o o l s and this con t in u es even after they become co ll e g e students .

If you help my study ing English , I want to help your study ing J a p an e se .
G la d to read my ent ry .
L if e is short er than I think .
I am to t ally 2 1 year s old but I have never thought about my future life serious ly .
I saw the other s have got their own f in al dis t in ation .
Some success , some are still keep on try ing hard to get th i er go al s .
This point made me want to serious with my life .
E ver y on e have got dr e ame s .
I also got dr e a m s , but what I dr e a m are im po s s i ble soon .
To tell you about one of my dr e a m .
I want to study a b o ar d where is f o c us on my interest ed ma j or .
I co un l d n ' t tell them about this story , just keep in my mind .
There are 5 person in my family .
We don t ri ch enough to sen d me study a b o ad and I don t want to be s el f f ish .
As time pass by , It seemed I have got the good thing from my p ar ent more than my s is ter and brother
A fter class I just took the e le v at or down to the bu il d ing with my listen ing class teacher and two of my class m ate .
On of my class m ate turn ed to the teacher to im p ro ve our listen ing s k i ll .
The teacher said that we should listen the me ter i al over and over and try to f i g ur e out all the w or d s and sen t ence s after class .
If we c a n ' t still f i g ur e out some w or d s - es pe c i al the te ch n ical w or d s - after listen ing it over and over again , we have to try to write it down and look up in a di ction ar y .
M o st of all , he e m p ha s i z ed that we had better not to read the s c ri p t from begin ing to end .
That ' s what I le ar n ed about to day .
I ' m work ing in a p u b l ish ing comp an y , and our se ction p u b l ish es month ly w ed d ing i nformation ma g a z in e .
No w I j o in in a pro j e c t to study about the w ed d ing mar ke t s of for e i g n co un t ri es , es pe c i ally of C h in a .
We dis c us s the t re n d of over se a w ed d ing of C h in e se co up le s ; in J a p an there are f e w re l i g i ous w ed d ing ce re m on ies , so some J a p an e se co up le s ch o o se the over se a w ed d ing , for ex amp le hold ce re m on ies in H a w a i i , G u a m , and so on .
I must in ter v i e w some co up le s who had already he l d the over se a w ed d ing .
I think their fresh voice s are most im p or t ant hi n t of my pro j e c t .
9 : I want to make our ga r d en full of p in k in sp r ing .
I found out that most people who study J a p an e se like J a p an e se c ar t o on .
I ' m not so good at man g a and an im e .
So , I ' m p l an n ing to know the se c ate g or y .
It mean s to insist on something no matter any difficult ies come up .
The e v al u ation is not re al because there are not any on e else to say so .
I always go work by b ic y c le ,
but to day I went by f o ot so it ra in ed .
My f o ot got so a k ed very much .
This is our first time to hold it .
