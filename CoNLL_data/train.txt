So, in the following. 	So, in the <del> <Others> following </Others> </del> <ins> following paragraphs </ins>, I will clarify these two different views <del> <Prep> for </Prep> </del> <ins> of </ins> rising life <del> <Nn> expectancies </Nn> </del> <ins> expectancy </ins>. 
For the first part, rising life expectancies is a challenge. 	For the first part, rising life <del> <Nn> expectancies </Nn> </del> <ins> expectancy </ins> is a challenge. 
We should  or globally is also rising. 	We <del> <Vm> should  </Vm> </del> <ins> can </ins><del> <Wform> image </Wform> </del> <ins> imagine </ins> that when the life <del> <Nn> expectancies </Nn> </del> <ins> expectancy </ins> <del> <SVA> are </SVA> </del> <ins> raises </ins> <del> <Vform> raised  </Vform> </del> <ins>  </ins><del> <Prep> up </Prep> </del> <ins>  </ins><del> <Ssub> ; </Ssub> </del> <ins> , </ins> this will mean that the average age <del> <Prep> for </Prep> </del> <ins> of </ins> the population <del> <Prep> in </Prep> </del> <ins>  </ins> <del> <Spar> nation </Spar> </del> <ins> nationally </ins> <del> <Rloc-> wise </Rloc-> </del> <ins>  </ins> or globally is also rising. 
The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher. 	The number of the older people will increase to make the average life <del> <Nn> expectancies </Nn> </del> <ins> expectancy </ins> higher. 
For these older people, the and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them. 	For these older people, <del> <ArtOrDet> the </ArtOrDet> </del> <ins>  </ins> society <del> <SVA> need </SVA> </del> <ins> needs </ins> <del> <Mec> man power </Mec> </del> <ins> manpower </ins> and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them. 
Sometimes, older and resources than normal young people. 	Sometimes, <del> <Others> older </Others> </del> <ins> older people </ins> need more <del> <Mec> man power </Mec> </del> <ins> manpower </ins> and resources than normal young people. 
However society. 	<del> <Trans> However </Trans> </del> <ins> Moreover </ins>, these older people usually contribute less or <del> <WOadv> nearly have </WOadv> </del> <ins> have nearly </ins> no productivity <del> <Prep> for  </Prep> </del> <ins> in </ins><del> <ArtOrDet> the </ArtOrDet> </del> <ins>  </ins> society. 
We have to say that the and resources.

So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age. 	So the dilemma <del> <Wci> takes place </Wci> </del> <ins> occurs </ins> when there are more people who have a higher age. 
Not only has. 	Not only <del> <Vform> has </Vform> </del> <ins>  </ins> the <del> <Wci> family member </Wci> </del> <ins> families </ins> of the old people, but also the government <del> <Vt> needed </Vt> </del> <ins> need </ins> to <del> <Wci> spend </Wci> </del> <ins> put </ins> a lot of effort <del> <Prep> to </Prep> </del> <ins> into </ins> <del> <Wform> handle </Wform> </del> <ins> handling </ins> such <del> <ArtOrDet> situation </ArtOrDet> </del> <ins> a situation </ins>.
