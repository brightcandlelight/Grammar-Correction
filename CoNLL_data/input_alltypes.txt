In <del><ArtOrDet>modern</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modern</ins> digital world, electronic products are widely used in daily <del><Nn>lives</Nn></del><ins>life</ins> such as <del><Mec>Smart</Mec></del><ins>smart</ins> phones, computers and etc. 
In <del><ArtOrDet><del</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the workplace</ins>><Mec>work places</Mec></del><ins></ins>, electronic <del><Mec>devices</Mec></del><ins>devices,</ins> such as <del><Mec>computers</Mec></del><ins>computers,</ins> are also inevitable <del><Rloc->to use to</Rloc-></del><ins>to</ins> increase the productivity of the corporation. 
The convenience and high efficiency of using electronic products <del><Vt>is being</Vt></del><ins>has been</ins> noticed by people worldwide. 
Some people <del><Vt>started</Vt></del><ins>have started</ins> to <del><Wci>think</Wci></del><ins>wonder</ins> if electronic products can <del><Um>be further operated to more advanced utilization</Um></del><ins></ins> and <del><Wci>replace human beings for better performances</Wci></del><ins>outperform human beings</ins>. 
Surveillance <del><Mec>technology</Mec></del><ins>technology,</ins> such as RFID (radio-frequency <del><Mec>identification)</Mec></del><ins>identification),</ins> is one <del><Rloc->type of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>examples</Nn></del><ins>example</ins> that <del><Vt><del><WOadv>has cu</Vt></del><ins>is being currently</ins>rrently been</WOadv></del><ins></ins> implemented. 
In this essay, I will discuss <del><Trans><del><S</Trans></del><ins>whether</ins>sub>that if</Ssub></del><ins></ins> surveillance <del><Mec>technology</Mec></del><ins>technology,</ins> such as RFID (radio-frequency <del><Mec>identification)</Mec></del><ins>identification),</ins> should be used or <del><V0>not</V0></del><ins>not used</ins> to track people. 
Personally, I agree to a large extent that surveillance <del><Mec>technology</Mec></del><ins>technology,</ins> such as <del><Mec>RFID</Mec></del><ins>RFID,</ins> should be used to track people. 

Surveillance <del><Mec>technology</Mec></del><ins>technology,</ins> such as <del><Mec>RFID</Mec></del><ins>RFID,</ins> can be operated twenty-four hours <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>without</ins> <del><Rloc->the absence of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> operators to <del><Wci>track done</Wci></del><ins>track</ins> every detail about human activities. 
For instance, <del><ArtOrDet>in </ArtOrDet></del><ins>in the</ins><del><Nn>militaries</Nn></del><ins>military,</ins> <del><Um>which are of high importance</Um></del><ins></ins>, surveillance technology is essential as it is a way to provide undeniable <del><Nn>evidences</Nn></del><ins>evidence</ins> if anything <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> <del><Prep>fault</Prep></del><ins>at fault</ins>. 
In <del><Mec>supermarkets</Mec></del><ins>supermarkets,</ins> where it is difficult to catch <del><Wci>stealers</Wci></del><ins>thieves</ins>, surveillance <del><Mec>technology</Mec></del><ins>technology,</ins> which makes records that can be replayed or <del><SVA>detect</SVA></del><ins>detects</ins> <del><Wci>stealers</Wci></del><ins>theives</ins> on the <del><Mec>spot</Mec></del><ins>spot,</ins> <del><SVA>are </SVA></del><ins>is</ins><del><Wci>superior to use</Wci></del><ins>beneficial</ins>. 
The high accuracy <del><Prep>in utilizing</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> surveillance technology eliminates the <del><Wci>amount</Wci></del><ins>number</ins> of disagreements among people. 
If people are aware of the existence of surveillance, the <del><Wci>chance</Wci></del><ins>possibility</ins> <del><Vm>for them to</Vm></del><ins>they would</ins> follow rules and orders is high. 
It is useful as it reduces the chances of <del><Nn><del><Mec>wr</Nn></del><ins>wrongdoing</ins>ong doings</Mec></del><ins></ins> <del><Ssub>that <del><Vm></Ssub></del><ins>occurring</ins>may <del></Vm></del><ins> </ins><Vform>occur</Vform></del><ins></ins>. 
Therefore, surveillance technology makes our society more <del><Wci>ordered</Wci></del><ins>law abiding</ins>. 

Risks can be analyzed if there is a record of what <del><Vform>was happened</Vform></del><ins>happened</ins> in the past. 
In <del><ArtOrDet>late</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the late</ins> nineteenth century, <del><WOinc>there was a severe air crash happening</WOinc></del><ins>a severe air crash occurred</ins> at Miami <del><Mec>international</Mec></del><ins>International</ins> airport. 
<del><WOinc>The air cargo of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></WOinc></del><ins>A fire started in the air cargo to a Valujet plane</ins></del><ins> </ins> Valujet plane was on fire after the plane had taken off. 
<del><Trans>Sooner or later, the</Trans></del><ins>The</ins> electric systems <del><Vform>were short circuited</Vform></del><ins>short circuited</ins> <del><Prep>as</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> result that the airplane was out of control and <del><Vt><del><Mec>n</Vt></del><ins></ins>ose diving</Mec></del><ins>nosedived</ins> to the ground <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> extremely high speed. 
All passengers and pilots <del><Vform>were died</Vform></del><ins>died</ins>. 
After finding and analyzing the black box of the <del><Wci>Valujet</Wci></del><ins>plane</ins> after the <del><Wform>incidence</Wform></del><ins>incident</ins>, police investigators <del><Prep>found out </Prep></del><ins>found</ins><del><ArtOrDet>reasons</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the reasons</ins> <del><Ssub>for</Ssub></del><ins>that</ins> <del><Vform>causing</Vform></del><ins>caused</ins> this <del><Wci>severe </Wci></del><ins>serious</ins><del><Wform>incidence</Wform></del><ins>incident</ins>. 
Surveillance technology <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be used to detect very risky events and prevent <del><Pform><de</Pform></del><ins>them</ins>l><Pref>its</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> <del><Prep>happening</Prep></del><ins>from happening</ins> in the future, hence <del><Vform>to save</Vform></del><ins>saving</ins> more lives. 
In addition, if surveillance technology <del><WOinc>is</WOinc></del><ins>becomes</ins> even better developed, it <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be used to detect <del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins><del><Nn>problem</Nn></del><ins>problems</ins> before <del><ArtOrDet>the real </ArtOrDet></del><ins>real</ins><del><Wform>accidence</Wform></del><ins>accidents</ins> <del><Vt>has <del><Wc</Vt></del><ins>occurs</ins>i>happened</Wci></del><ins></ins>. 

However, the dark side of using surveillance technology is that it results in <del><ArtOrDet>the invasion</ArtOrDet></del><ins>invasion</ins> of privacy. 
People under supervision are under high pressure to perform naturally. 
People are less likely to enjoy life under surveillance. 
Therefore, surveillance technology provides convenience to <del><ArtOrDet>the society</ArtOrDet></del><ins>society</ins> but <del><Wci>makes</Wci></del><ins>causes</ins> more inconvenience to individuals. 
Therefore, surveillance technology can be used but the use of surveillance should be modified in such a way that individuals are less affected in normal life. 
In general, surveillance technology benefits <del><ArtOrDet>the society</ArtOrDet></del><ins>society</ins> and should be <del><Wci>applied</Wci></del><ins>used</ins> <del><Um>with the consideration of</Um></del><ins></ins> individuals' <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins>. 

I do not agree <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>the modernwith</ins> this <del><Prep>argument</Prep></del><ins>statement</ins> that surveillance technology should not be used to track people. 
<del><Rloc->In this fast moving society, technology</Rloc-></del><ins>Technology</ins> is always improving to <del><Prep>catch up</Prep></del><ins>catch up with</ins> the fast pace of this world and most surveillance technology is used by the police or <del><Spar>other army usage</Spar></del><ins>military</ins> to track people down. 
Although <del><ArtOrDet>the surveillance</ArtOrDet></del><ins>surveillance</ins> technology is an issue in <del><Wci>invading</Wci></del><ins>safeguarding</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>human</ins> privacy, it has also brought us lots of benefits and security. 
There are two points supporting this argument. 
Firstly, security systems <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>have</ins> improved in many areas such as <del><Prep>school</Prep></del><ins>on the school</ins> campus or at the workplace. 
Secondly, it makes it possible for parents to track their children and also their elderly parents. 
Therefore, this technology should be used to track people. 

<del><Wform>Many</Wform></del><ins>Much</ins> of this surveillance <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> being implemented in <del><ArtOrDet>the government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>government</ins> sectors, <del><Trans>military</Trans></del><ins>or military</ins> areas to enhance their security. 
It can also be found in schools and workplaces. 
It is useful to the government and <del><ArtOrDet>the people</ArtOrDet></del><ins>people</ins> in the law sector. 
They can maintain social control and recognize threats. 
Video surveillance gives people a sense of security should anything happen. 
In addition, it can provide all day surveillance around the school or office with little manpower needed. 
For example, intruders can be detected if there are any in schools or offices. 
This can protect the students from being in a dangerous <del><Mec>situation</Mec></del><ins>situation,</ins> <del><Prep>in particularly for</Prep></del><ins>particularly</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> small children who are studying in nursery. 
In addition, it can also prevent theft. 
This technology can also be a helpful tool to assist <del><ArtOrDet>the law</ArtOrDet></del><ins>law</ins> <del><Mec>enforcers</Mec></del><ins>enforcers,</ins> such as the <del><Mec>police</Mec></del><ins>police,</ins> to collect <del><Nn>evidences</Nn></del><ins>evidence</ins> of <del><Nn>crime</Nn></del><ins>crimes</ins> after <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><Vt>occurred</Vt></del><ins>occur</ins>. 
This can increase the efficiency of solving <del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins><del><Nn>crime</Nn></del><ins>crimes</ins> and thus decreasing the <del><Wci>amount</Wci></del><ins>number</ins> of criminal acts or people. 
With the help of <del><ArtOrDet>the video</ArtOrDet></del><ins>video</ins> surveillance, the <del><Wci>chances</Wci></del><ins>number</ins> of people <del><Wci>performing</Wci></del><ins>committing</ins> crimes <del><Vm>can </Vm></del><ins>could</ins><del><Vform>be decreased</Vform></del><ins>decrease</ins>. 

<del><Trans>However</Trans></del><ins>Although</ins>, video surveillance may be a help to most sectors, it can also be misused by many people. 
Some may use it to peek or record something illegal. 
For example, it could be installed in personal lockers to record other's moves and actions. 
This technology could also be seen as <del><Prep>invasion of</Prep></del><ins>invading</ins> <del><Npos>human's</Npos></del><ins>human</ins> privacy. 
Surveillance technology could cause everyone to feel paranoid and as if our actions are being watched. 
This could lead to psychological implications and thus <del><Spar>causing</Spar></del><ins>cause</ins> many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society. 
If everyone is being watched unknowingly, it seems that our freedom of doing things is <del><Vform>being <del><W</Vform></del><ins>compromised</ins>ci>invaded</Wci></del><ins></ins>. 

Technology can be a very useful tool if <del><Ssub>being</Ssub></del><ins>it is</ins> used in the correct manner. 
It may <del><Vform>be</Vform></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> help to prevent potential crimes from happening but also help people <del><Wci>do</Wci></del><ins>commit</ins> <del><Spar>crime</Spar></del><ins>crimes</ins>. 
The <del><Um>knowledge of</Um></del><ins></ins> installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be eliminated instead of <del><Vform>increasing</Vform></del><ins>increase</ins> <del><Rloc->it</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
<del><Trans>The</Trans></del><ins>However, the</ins> more people <del><Vform>using</Vform></del><ins>use</ins> it <del><Prep>over</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> us, the more power they will have <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>over</ins> us. 
We should respect that everyone has human rights and without <del><Wci>other's permission</Wci></del><ins>permission</ins>, <del><Pref>this</Pref></del><ins>this technology</ins> should not be placed or implanted <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> anyone. 
We do not want to be sued <del><Prep>infringing</Prep></del><ins>for infringing</ins> <del><Npos>other's</Npos></del><ins></ins> <del><Srun>privacy,</Srun></del><ins>privacy;</ins> therefore, before implanting any RFID, we should ask for <del><Npos>other's consent</Npos></del><ins>consent</ins>. 

Surveillance technology is getting more and more widely used with the development of modern technology in terms of various scientific breakthroughs. 
And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life<del><Srun>, products</Srun></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Products</ins> such as RFID tracking <del><Nn>system</Nn></del><ins>systems</ins> have become real. 
RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage <del><Nn>purpose</Nn></del><ins>purposes</ins>, it is also used to track people <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>through</ins> <del><Rloc->doing human</Rloc-></del><ins>human</ins> implants. 
It is unacceptable for some people in <del><ArtOrDet>the society</ArtOrDet></del><ins>society</ins><del><Srun>, however</Srun></del><ins>. 
However</ins>, I think this application is necessary and provides <del><ArtOrDet>the society</ArtOrDet></del><ins>society</ins> a lot of <del><Nn>benefit</Nn></del><ins>benefits</ins>. 

Surveillance technology such as RFID has been used to track people <del><Srun>may</Srun></del><ins>and may</ins> help to reduce the number of people who get lost. 
For example, there are always <del><Wci>news</Wci></del><ins>reports</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>newspaper</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the newspaper</ins><del><Ssub>, report that</Ssub></del><ins>about</ins> some <del><Wci>elderly</Wci></del><ins>elderly people</ins> <del><Ssub>get</Ssub></del><ins>who get</ins> lost at certain <del><Nn>place</Nn></del><ins>places</ins> and their <del><Nn>family</Nn></del><ins>families</ins> are looking for <del><Pref>him or her</Pref></del><ins>them</ins>. 
The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost <del><Wci>elderly</Wci></del><ins>elderly person</ins>, and with the help of police <del><Wform>office</Wform></del><ins>officers</ins> , maybe they can find the <del><Wci>elderly</Wci></del><ins>elderly person</ins> <del><Rloc->back,</Rloc-></del><ins>,</ins> but it will take a long time, and a lot of energy to find someone in a country <del><Ssub>has</Ssub></del><ins>that has</ins> a population <del><ArtOrDet>about</ArtOrDet></del><ins>of about</ins> five million without knowing the exact location of that person. 
However, if the <del><Wci>elderly</Wci></del><ins>elderly person</ins> has been implanted with <del><ArtOrDet>RFID</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a RFID</ins> <del><Nn>devices</Nn></del><ins>device</ins>, then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each <del><Rloc->device differently</Rloc-></del><ins>device</ins>. 
They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals<del><Trans>; therefore</Trans></del><ins> and</ins> find the location of the lost <del><Wci>elderly</Wci></del><ins>elderly person</ins> in a shorter period of time. 

Surveillance technology such as RFID is not only useful to track <del><ArtOrDet>the lost</ArtOrDet></del><ins>lost</ins> people <del><V0>but</V0></del><ins>but is</ins> also useful to prevent the trading of <del><Mec>children</Mec></del><ins>children,</ins> which happens in many developing countries. 
It may be known that young children may be stolen by some agency <del><Rloc->that doing the business to </Rloc-></del><ins>that</ins><del><SVA>trade</SVA></del><ins>trades</ins> the children. 
For example, they may wait in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> public area and wait for <del><Rloc->parents to bring their children out</Rloc-></del><ins>parents</ins> <del><Ssub>but</Ssub></del><ins>who</ins> <del><Vt>did</Vt></del><ins>do</ins><del><Wtone>n't</Wtone></del><ins> not</ins> pay attention to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their</ins> child, so that this kind of agency may bring the child to <del><ArtOrDet>mountain</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a mountain</ins> area and sell him or her <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> a good price. 
Since this <del><Vform>is happen</Vform></del><ins>happens</ins> more often <del><ArtOrDet>in the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>in</ins> <del><Nn>country</Nn></del><ins>countries</ins> which <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> much larger than Singapore, it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the <del><Rloc->child back</Rloc-></del><ins>child</ins> without knowing where the child has been brought to. 
<del><Sfrag>Since this may happen across <del><Nn>province</Nn></del><ins>provinces</ins>, and without any clue about t</Sfrag></del><ins></ins>he path that the child <del><Vm>may went </Vm></del><ins>may have gone</ins><del><Prep>through</Prep></del><ins>along</ins>. 
However, if the child has been <del><Wci>installed</Wci></del><ins>implanted</ins> with <del><ArtOrDet>tracking</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a tracking</ins> device, more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back. 
Not only the details of location will be provided, but also <del><Ssub>may</Ssub></del><ins>details that may</ins> lead <del><Rloc->to find out the root of this kind of</Rloc-></del><ins>to</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>children</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the children</ins> trading agency <del><Ssub>and it </Ssub></del><ins>and</ins><del><Vm>helps</Vm></del><ins>help</ins> to prevent more <del><Prep>this</Prep></del><ins>of this</ins> kind of tragedy <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> <del><Vform>happen</Vform></del><ins>happening</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> any family. 

Surveillance technology will help to <del><ArtOrDet>prevent the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>prevent</ins> <del><Nn>family</Nn></del><ins>families</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> <del><Vform>loss</Vform></del><ins>losing</ins> their <del><Nn>member</Nn></del><ins>members</ins> <del><Mec>especially</Mec></del><ins>, especially</ins> the elderly and the children <del><Trans>which</Trans></del><ins>who</ins> need to be <del><Vform>pay</Vform></del><ins>paid</ins> more attention to. 

As <del><ArtOrDet>the technology</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnology</ins> increasingly advances, many of things that <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> regarded as impossible are <del><Wci>turning into</Wci></del><ins>becoming</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins><del><Wform>'possibles'</Wform></del><ins>possible</ins>. 
<del><ArtOrDet>From </ArtOrDet></del><ins>From the</ins><del><Mec>internet</Mec></del><ins>Internet</ins><del><Trans>,</Trans></del><ins> and</ins> email to the most powerful surveillance technology, every step is <del><ArtOrDet>advancement</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an advancement</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> not only <del><ArtOrDet>the society</ArtOrDet></del><ins>society</ins> but also the world's achievements. 
People's lives <del><Vt><del><</Vt></del><ins></ins>Wci>become</Wci></del><ins>are going</ins> from increasingly convenient to almost <del><Wform>luxury</Wform></del><ins>luxurious</ins>, thanks to the implementation of <del><Others>increasingly</Others></del><ins>increasingly advanced</ins> technology available <del><ArtOrDet>for the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>for</ins> <del><Mec>Man's</Mec></del><ins>man's</ins> life. 
<del><Trans>However,</Trans></del><ins>Although</ins> such <del><Wform>rapid</Wform></del><ins>rapidly</ins> <del><Wform>advancement</Wform></del><ins>advancing</ins> technology though can be extremely useful to our daily life; it can also cause <del><ArtOrDet>the invisible</ArtOrDet></del><ins>invisible</ins> or massive threats to our peaceful <del><Wform>livings</Wform></del><ins>life</ins> that can be <del><Prep>out of</Prep></del><ins>beyond</ins> our <del><Nn>imaginations</Nn></del><ins>imagination</ins> and <del><Nn>estimations</Nn></del><ins>estimation</ins>. 

Today, <del><ArtOrDet>the surveillance</ArtOrDet></del><ins>surveillance</ins> technology has become almost <del><Wci>manifest</Wci></del><ins>ubiquitous</ins> <del><Prep>to wherever</Prep></del><ins>wherever</ins> we go. 
Take Singapore for example, <del><Pref>these</Pref></del><ins>surveillance</ins> <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> <del><Others>installed</Others></del><ins>installed everywhere</ins> from highly secured places such as Government <del><Wci>sectors</Wci></del><ins>buildings</ins> to working places, from condominiums to housing development board <del><Wci>houses</Wci></del><ins>blocks</ins>, and even <del><Prep>from school</Prep></del><ins>school</ins> canteens <del><Trans>to</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> toilets! Even <del><ArtOrDet>our applications</ArtOrDet></del><ins>applications</ins> in our Iphones or other smartphones, <del><Spar>our</Spar></del><ins>or our</ins> <del><Nn>I-pad</Nn></del><ins>I-pads</ins> can easily <del><Vm>revealed</Vm></del><ins>reveal</ins> our <del><Nn>locations</Nn></del><ins>location</ins>. 
Every <del><Nn>moves</Nn></del><ins>move</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Pref>us </Pref></del><ins></ins><del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> being closely surveilled and followed once we <del><Vt>stepped</Vt></del><ins>step</ins> out of <del><Npos>homes</Npos></del><ins>our homes</ins>. 
Now, surveillance technology such as RFID <del><Vt>is even</Vt></del><ins>has even been</ins> invented to track people. 
I agree to a great extent that RFID technology <del><Vm>shall</Vm></del><ins>should</ins> not be easily available <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> the public <del><Trans>and</Trans></del><ins>or</ins> taken for granted. 
On the other hand, I will also <del><Ssub>discuss</Ssub></del><ins>discuss how</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the RFID</ArtOrDet></del><ins>RFID</ins> <del><Vm>shall</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> be utilized for good purposes. 

I agree that RFID technology <del><Vm>shall</Vm></del><ins>should</ins> not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage. 
First, our privacy is at threat. 
Though tracking devices such as the applications in our smartphones these days can add fun and entertainment to our fast-<del><Rloc->living paced</Rloc-></del><ins>paced</ins> <del><Nn>livings</Nn></del><ins>life</ins>, this can be a double-edged sword. 
We <del><Vt>revealed</Vt></del><ins>reveal</ins> our locations, for our friends to catch up with <del><Srun>us,</Srun></del><ins>us;</ins> <del><Mec>however</Mec></del><ins>however,</ins> we can never know who is watching us out there secretly. 
Hackers <del><Vt>become</Vt></del><ins>have become</ins> increasingly vicious, <del><Prep>invading into</Prep></del><ins>invading</ins> our computer <del><Nn>system</Nn></del><ins>systems</ins><del><Srun>, now</Srun></del><ins>. 
Now</ins> <del><Prep>with radio</Prep></del><ins>radio</ins>-frequency tracking <del><Nn>device</Nn></del><ins>devices</ins><del><Ssub>, this may</Ssub></del><ins>may</ins> fall into inappropriate hands for the wrong reasons. 
Every <del><Nn>moves</Nn></del><ins>move</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Pref>us </Pref></del><ins></ins><del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> easily tracked. 
This is very hazardous. 
No matter how good and how many security systems <del><WOinc>are there</WOinc></del><ins>there are</ins> for us, the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and breaking the codes of the security <del><Nn>system</Nn></del><ins>systems</ins>. 

On the other hand, I think RFID can be useful <del><Prep>when comes to</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> appropriate handling and usage. 
For example, <del><Pform>this</Pform></del><ins>it</ins> can be a very beneficial and useful device for <del><ArtOrDet>police</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements, or contributing to more leads for solving a case. 
Additionally, if appropriately used, this device can <del><Vm>contributed</Vm></del><ins>contribute</ins> to our scientific findings and research. 
In this, I mean that we can <del><Wci>input</Wci></del><ins>implant</ins> this device <del><Rloc->implant into</Rloc-></del><ins>into</ins> <del><Nn>an animal</Nn></del><ins>animals</ins> or <del><Wci>birds species</Wci></del><ins>birds</ins>, <del><Prep>for us to</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> track their movements and actions <del><Um>relating to our human research that can bring us to a new regime</Um></del><ins></ins>. 

RFID is indeed a great invention. 
It can benefit <del><ArtOrDet>our mankind</ArtOrDet></del><ins>mankind</ins> if appropriately used. 
However, I think such powerful <del><Nn>device</Nn></del><ins>devices</ins> <del><Vm>shall</Vm></del><ins>should</ins> not be made easily available <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> the public or fall into the hands of 'ill-intentioned' individuals. 
This will lead to more crimes and <del><Wci>bring threats to</Wci></del><ins>threaten</ins> our privacy. 

RFID is used in many <del><Wci>forms</Wci></del><ins>the modernwith.

Other than using it <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> these areas, it is also been used as <del><ArtOrDet>human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a human</ins> implant or as <del><Rloc->a form of </Rloc-></del><ins>a</ins><del><Nn>products</Nn></del><ins>product</ins>. 
These implants and products <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>have</ins> also been used as surveillance tools.

There are also medical tools that are more of <del><ArtOrDet>implant</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an implant</ins> into the human body for <del><ArtOrDet>the basic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>basic</ins> medical research. 
Moreover, the use of RFID <del><Nn>chip</Nn></del><ins>chips</ins> in tracking clothes <del><Vt><del</Vt></del><ins>is</ins>><SVA>were</SVA></del><ins></ins> also very common sight in the service <del><Trans>industry </Trans></del><ins>industry becaue</ins><del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked <del><Rloc->the location of it</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> at any one point. 

<del><Trans>When</Trans></del><ins>As</ins> RFID <del><Vt>had</Vt></del><ins>has</ins> been used in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> transportation <del><Rloc->needs</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> in the form of ez-link cards, the ability to gain faster and easier access of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> transportation needs <del><Vt>had</Vt></del><ins>has</ins> been seen over the years.

This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order.

Moreover, the use of the RFID for medical research <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>has</ins> also been widely used in many countries. 
These chips were also implanted under the human skin where <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> also <del><SVA>helps</SVA></del><ins>help</ins> to store the basic information of the <del><Wci>person</Wci></del><ins>patient</ins> <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins></ins>.

This is a scene seen in Resort World Sentosa. 
The clothes were all implanted with an RFID tracking chip for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes is at. 
As their clothes were mass collected and washed by an external company, the ability to have a tracking system to know the whereabouts of their clothing helps in terms of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> logistical hassle. 

Therefore, the <del><Nn>usages</Nn></del><ins>usage</ins> of RFID chips <del><Vt><del</Vt></del><ins>is</ins>><SVA>were</SVA></del><ins></ins> more useful to help the human in the basic needs or task that is required.

<del><Mec>Therefore</Mec></del><ins>Therefore,</ins> I agree that the use of the RFID technology in tracking any person or product <del><Ssub>that</Ssub></del><ins></ins> would help the human race which also <del><Vt>been</Vt></del><ins>has been</ins> <del><Vform>mention</Vform></del><ins>mentioned</ins> above. 

I think that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people. 
Nowadays, with the rapid development of science and technology, <del><ArtOrDet>the emerging</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemerging</ins> technologies always contribute to <del><WOinc>human beings better living conditions</WOinc></del><ins>better living conditions for human beings</ins>. 
For example, the Internet has <del><Wci>abridged</Wci></del><ins>bridged</ins> the distance among people globally. 
Although we have to admit some bad <del><Nn>effect</Nn></del><ins>effects</ins> which <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> <del><Prep>brought up</Prep></del><ins>brought</ins> by the new technology, still the advantages of the new technologies cannot be simply discarded. 
Back to the surveillance technology, people may say it <del><Wci>leaks</Wci></del><ins>threatens</ins> their privacy or personal life. 
Compared to this disadvantage, we should think about <del><Ssub>what the</Ssub></del><ins>the</ins> advantages it <del><Wci>has make available for</Wci></del><ins>offers</ins> human beings. 
It can provide a safe, <del><Wci>convenient, identifiable</Wci></del><ins>convenient</ins> environment. 

Tracking people using surveillance technology can <del><Wci>make</Wci></del><ins>offer</ins> better <del><Rloc->security of people's life</Rloc-></del><ins>security</ins>. 
<del><Trans>For</Trans></del><ins>For example,</ins> <del><Ssub>the old people, if they are alone at home, one day, they want to go out for a walk. 
In case, they have some accident like heart attack, the track of them will show there is something wrong</Ssub></del><ins>if an old person living alone decides to go out for a walk, the surveillance will show if there is something wrong, such as some accident like a heart attack</ins>. 
The <del><Wci>people</Wci></del><ins>ambulance</ins> can get there as soon as possible to save them. 
<del><Smod>For the young people, parents</Smod></del><ins>Parents</ins> do not need to worry about where <del><Pref>my</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> kids will go after the school. 
By investigating the <del><Wci>track</Wci></del><ins>record</ins> <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> the surveillance technology, they can easily figure out where <del><WOinc>are their kids</WOinc></del><ins>their kids are</ins> now and know roughly what they are doing. 
<del><Trans>On the other hand</Trans></del><ins>In addition</ins>, due to the <del><Wform>track</Wform></del><ins>tracking</ins> of people, the police can better know a person's daily schedule. 
It gives the police <del><ArtOrDet>a better</ArtOrDet></del><ins>better</ins> control of the criminal. 
All <del><Rloc->these contributions by</Rloc-></del><ins>these</ins> <del><Wform>using</Wform></del><ins>uses</ins> <del><Prep>the</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> surveillance <del><Rloc->technology to track</Rloc-></del><ins>technology</ins> <del><SVA>make</SVA></del><ins>makes</ins> the environment safer. 

Tracking people using surveillance technology can make people's life more <del><Wci>convenient and identifiable</Wci></del><ins>convenient</ins>. 
Nowadays, people need to carry a lot of ID cards around to show that <del><Pref>I</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><SVA>am</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> the <del><Um>one the same as the one on the ID cards</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
If we have <del><Pref>these</Pref></del><ins>this</ins> <del><Nn>technologies</Nn></del><ins>technology</ins>, it will automatically confirm people's <del><Wci>indemnification</Wci></del><ins>identity</ins> and save the effort <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Wform>carry</Wform></del><ins>carrying</ins> a lot of cards. 
Once people have their own identity confirmed, they <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>do</ins> <del><WOinc>even need not</WOinc></del><ins>not even need</ins> to bring any money along with them. 
To purchase goods, they just need to <del><Wci>deduce</Wci></del><ins>deduct</ins> money from their <del><Wci>identity</Wci></del><ins>account</ins> and make a <del><Wci>transition</Wci></del><ins>transfer</ins> of money to the one who is selling the goods. 
<del><Trans>Based</Trans></del><ins>Because</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> the <del><Wci>identifiable environment</Wci></del><ins>surveillance technology</ins>, a lot of <del><Wform>convention</Wform></del><ins>conventional</ins> <del><Nn>way</Nn></del><ins>ways</ins> or <del><Nn>style</Nn></del><ins>styles</ins> of human life <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be changed. 

<del><Smod>For the privacy concern, if</Smod></del><ins>If</ins> the technology can be made to adjust to human being's <del><Nn>feeling</Nn></del><ins>feelings</ins>, it <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> be more <del><Smod>welcomed</Smod></del><ins>welcomed by those concerned about privacy</ins>. 
For example, if the one who <del><SVA>carry</SVA></del><ins>carries</ins> the identifiable sensor does not <del><ArtOrDet>want any</ArtOrDet></del><ins>want</ins> <del><Nn>other</Nn></del><ins>others</ins> to know his or her location, he or she can disable the <del><Wform>track</Wform></del><ins>tracking</ins>. 
Then, you may ask, how can the police get the information? I think that the <del><Wform>track</Wform></del><ins>tracking</ins> can be saved in some place which is not open to public
<del><Trans>Once</Trans></del><ins>If</ins> it is <del><Wci>very severe</Wci></del><ins>needed</ins>, the records <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be <del><Wtone>pop out</Wtone></del><ins>opened</ins> for official use. 

As you can see, there are quite a lot of advantages of using <del><ArtOrDet>the surveillance</ArtOrDet></del><ins>surveillance</ins> technology to track people. 
In short, it can provide a safe, <del><Wci>convenient, identifiable</Wci></del><ins>convenient</ins> environment for human beings. 
<del><Trans>Besides</Trans></del><ins>Moreover</ins>, we can try to reduce the bad <del><Nn>effect</Nn></del><ins>effects</ins> <del><Vform>cause</Vform></del><ins>caused</ins> by the new technology. 
Thus, I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people. 

I do not agree with the above statement. 
In my opinion, surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people though there <del><SVA>do</SVA></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoes</ins> exist many problems if it <del><Wform>prevails</Wform></del><ins>is prevalent</ins>. 
<del><Pform>This</Pform></del><ins>It</ins> can help to regulate people's behavior, control crime and prevent terrorism, and <del><Wci>set up</Wci></del><ins>gather</ins> demographic data. 

RFID, despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringement, is different from video surveillance. 
Unlike video surveillance, RIFD can only reflect the location and movements of the person with tags. 
Without sending back any images or sound record, RFID is more user-friendly and helps <del><Wci>prevent</Wci></del><ins>preserve</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>user's</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the user's</ins> privacy <del><Wci>at the best it can</Wci></del><ins>as much as possible</ins>. 

Firstly, RFID is a useful tool to help to regulate human or animal behavior. 
The tags can be used on those who need to be <del><Vform>took</Vform></del><ins>taken</ins> <del><Prep>care</Prep></del><ins>care of</ins> or <del><ArtOrDet>the beloved</ArtOrDet></del><ins>beloved</ins> ones, such as a child whose parents are always <del><Vform>concerning</Vform></del><ins>concerned</ins> about his whereabouts when <del><ArtOrDet>parents</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the parents</ins> are not together with him, or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to <del><Vform>lost</Vform></del><ins>lose</ins> her. 
In the first case, RFID can be used to help parents to <del><Wform>surveillance</Wform></del><ins>surveil</ins> their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at <del><Pref>his</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> friends' home, and this may help parents regulate their children's behavior. 

Secondly, RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism. 
Everyday crimes <del><Vform>are happening</Vform></del><ins>happen</ins> from time to time, and <del><Um>help to keep low criminal rate</Um></del><ins></ins> can be a <del><Wa>combo</Wa></del><ins>combination</ins> of ethical, physiological and social problems. 
RFID can be one of the <del><Wci>trivial</Wci></del><ins>simple</ins> ways to help <del><Wci>dispel</Wci></del><ins>discourage</ins> criminal or <del><Wform>terroristic</Wform></del><ins>terorist</ins> <del><Wci>thoughts</Wci></del><ins>acts</ins>. 
Police can put tags on those that have <del><Rloc->potential intention</Rloc-></del><ins>potential</ins> to commit <del><Nn>crime</Nn></del><ins>crimes</ins>. 
Thus, when a man with a 'terrorism tag' <del><Vform>entering</Vform></del><ins>enters</ins> a junction or a plaza full of <del><Mec>people</Mec></del><ins>people,</ins> police should notice this and observe the man's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from <del><Vform>explode</Vform></del><ins>exploding</ins> TNT. 
Apart from preventing crime and terrorism, RFID can also be used as an evidence or alibi to help <del><Wci>infer</Wci></del><ins>determine</ins> whether the suspect is the criminal or not. 

<del><Wtone>What is more</Wtone></del><ins>Moreover</ins>, RFID can be used to help collect demographic data. 
If RFID is used on everyone and <del><Vform>running</Vform></del><ins>runs</ins> for years, <del><ArtOrDet>surveillance</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the surveillance</ins> centre will have a complete set of <del><Wform>statistic</Wform></del><ins>statistical</ins> data showing the movement of people from city to city, <del><Trans>from</Trans></del><ins>and from</ins> town to town, <del><Spar>which</Spar></del><ins>thus showing which</ins> city is expanding more than people thought, <del><Trans>which</Trans></del><ins>and which</ins> city is becoming less attractive. 
Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more <del><Nn>infrastructures</Nn></del><ins>infrastructure</ins>, what kind of <del><Nn>infrastructures</Nn></del><ins>infrastructure</ins> and what other <del><Nn>development</Nn></del><ins>developments</ins> should be made. 
<del><Wform>Economics</Wform></del><ins>Economists</ins> can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic <del><Nn>trend</Nn></del><ins>trends</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>of</ArtOrDet></del><ins>of the</ins> <del><Spar>local</Spar></del><ins>local area</ins> as well as <del><Prep>the</Prep></del><ins>for the</ins> whole country. 
As for transportation, <del><ArtOrDet>roads</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the roads</ins> and traffic authority can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes. 

In all, RFID should be applied to facilitate <del><Wform>governors</Wform></del><ins>governments</ins> to better manage the world that we are living. 
It can help regulate behaviors, prevent crime and <del><Wci>set up</Wci></del><ins>gather</ins> demographic <del><Rloc->data base</Rloc-></del><ins>data</ins> for various uses. 
But before the application, governments need to secure <del><ArtOrDet>safety</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the safety</ins> of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft. 
More importantly, governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information. 

As technology becomes more advanced nowadays, people are very exposed to the various <del><Rloc->types of technology</Rloc-></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypes</ins> in their daily lives. 
It is undeniable that technology has made <del><Pform>ours</Pform></del><ins>our</ins> lives and <del><Nn>works</Nn></del><ins>work</ins> easier and more efficient. 
However, when surveillance technology starts to <del><Mec>violet</Mec></del><ins>violate</ins> the privacy of people instead of being used in a more <del><Mec>benefitial </Mec></del><ins>beneficial</ins><del><Rloc->way towards people</Rloc-></del><ins>way</ins>, it is my opinion<del><Mec>, that,</Mec></del><ins> that</ins> such technology should <del><Vform>rethink</Vform></del><ins>be rethought</ins> <del><Rloc->its way of existence</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 

In fact, people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual <del><Mec>world-the</Mec></del><ins>world -- the</ins> <del><Mec>internet</Mec></del><ins>Internet</ins>. 
Social networks such as <del><Mec>facebook ,</Mec></del><ins>Facebook,</ins><del><Mec>Tiwtter</Mec></del><ins>Twitter</ins> and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users <del><Pref>without</Pref></del><ins>without their</ins> <del><Wci>being realised</Wci></del><ins>knowledge</ins>. 
This already raises up <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> problem of privacy leakage. 
The surveillance technology <del><Wci>deteriorates</Wci></del><ins>worsens</ins> the problem by <del><Wci>stalking</Wci></del><ins>violating</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins></ins> people's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people. 
<del><Pref>Such incident</Pref></del><ins>This</ins> happened in London a few years ago, when the government installed <del><Mec>CCTV()</Mec></del><ins>CCTV</ins> on several streets in order to better supervise its people <del><Trans>to</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> keep <del><Wci>the social order</Wci></del><ins>order</ins>. 
This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast <del><Wform>searching</Wform></del><ins>searches</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> people who violated the law and caused harm to others. 
Instead, when <del><Rloc->news of the</Rloc-></del><ins>the</ins> installment of such <del><Nn>device</Nn></del><ins>devices</ins> was released <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the newspaper, it was heavily <del><Mec>cricised</Mec></del><ins>criticised</ins> by the public. 
People were <del><Wci>claiming</Wci></del><ins>worried about</ins> the <del><Wform>lost</Wform></del><ins>loss</ins> of privacy. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The government</ins> had to uninstall all the devices in the end. 
From this case, we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some <del><Nn>way</Nn></del><ins>ways</ins><del><Srun>, however</Srun></del><ins>; however</ins>, when it <del><Wci>touches</Wci></del><ins>violates</ins> the privacy of <del><Rloc->people themselves</Rloc-></del><ins>people</ins>, it is unacceptable. 

<del><Wci>From the point of humanity</Wci></del><ins>For many</ins>, it is inhumane to use such technology on human beings. 
We often put tags on products and <del><Srun>animals because</Srun></del><ins>animals. 
Because</ins> we treat them as goods, it is easy for trade when they are all labelled and tagged. 
However, human beings are not animals or any other <del><Nn>products</Nn></del><ins>product</ins><del><Srun>, they</Srun></del><ins>. 
They</ins> have their own thoughts and freedom. 
They have <del><ArtOrDet>a full</ArtOrDet></del><ins>full</ins> control of their own lives. 
If so, then why do we need human implants to trace <del><ArtOrDet>their activities</ArtOrDet></del><ins>activities</ins> and lives when they are free to do things that they like. 
It is understandable that once people have human implants, they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily <del><Prep>traced out</Prep></del><ins>traced</ins>. 
However, this way of curbing <del><ArtOrDet>the crimes</ArtOrDet></del><ins>crimes</ins> is so <del><Wform>violent</Wform></del><ins>violating</ins> that will only cause people to rebel and think of ways to escape the <del><Wform>track</Wform></del><ins>tracking</ins> of such <del><Nn>device</Nn></del><ins>devices</ins>. 
<del><Mec>Afterall</Mec></del><ins>After all,</ins> there will be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality. 
Humanity can be best seen in the case of <del><WOinc>pets rearing</WOinc></del><ins>rearing pets</ins>. 
Pets are supposed to be chained when they are out <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the streets. 
However, in countries like China, where there is no law to force people to chain their pets, pets are usually left unchained and run freely <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the streets. 
It may be dangerous as some pets are rather fierce and <del><Srun>aggressive,</Srun></del><ins>aggressive;</ins> however, it is the <del><Wform>benevolence</Wform></del><ins>benevolent</ins> nature of human beings that we treat pets as "human beings", our <del><Mec>friends</Mec></del><ins>friends,</ins> that we do not want to restrict their freedom. 
This phenomenon is accepted by the <del><Mec>public</Mec></del><ins>public,</ins> even by those who do not own a pet. 
This shows that even though there is a risk of causing <del><Nn>harms</Nn></del><ins>harm</ins> to someone, people still <del><SVA>prefers</SVA></del><ins>prefer</ins> to bear the risk and allow their pets to have maximum freedom. 
<del><Trans>Even</Trans></del><ins>If even</ins> pets are granted <del><Prep>with freedom</Prep></del><ins>freedom</ins>, people themselves certainly treat freedom as something essential. 

In conclusion, I think that surveilence technology should <del><Rloc->not be allowed to</Rloc-></del><ins>not</ins> be used to track people. 
<del><Mec>it</Mec></del><ins>It</ins> <del><Trans>does not</Trans></del><ins>not</ins> only <del><SVA>restrict</SVA></del><ins>restricts</ins> their freedom in all aspects , but also <del><SVA>cause</SVA></del><ins>causes</ins> leakage of personal information. 
This greatly <del><Mec>violets</Mec></del><ins>violates</ins> the rights of people. 

Technology advancement is extremely fast nowadays. 
Surveillance technology is one of the main concerns <del><ArtOrDet>of</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof the</ins> military and national defense sectors. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Example</ArtOrDet></del><ins>An example</ins> of this technology is RFID (radio-frequency identification) which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on people. 
However, this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and cons. 
I personally stand together with the <del><Wci>population</Wci></del><ins>people</ins> who reject the proposal. 

First of all, everyone in the world belongs to themselves <del><Um>who does not belong to anyone</Um></del><ins></ins> from my personal perspective. 
Human rights <del><Vt>were</Vt></del><ins>have been</ins> raised up pretty frequently in the world over the past few years. 
Approval of RFID tracking <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> be seen as a violation of human rights and people will lose their most basic freedom. 
Would <del><WOinc>not it</WOinc></del><ins>it not</ins> <del><V0>similar</V0></del><ins>be similar</ins> to criminals in prison but in a bigger confined space? 
Secondly, the tracking proposal will raise a safety issue. 
The chip identifier technology can be reproduced by anyone. 
It <del><Wci>represents</Wci></del><ins>presents</ins> a query: <del><WOinc>is not everyone can</WOinc></del><ins>can everyone</ins> view each other's information such as name and age? The leakage of <del><ArtOrDet>these</ArtOrDet></del><ins>this</ins> confidential information can be a sensitive issue to <del><Wform>personal</Wform></del><ins>people</ins>, <del><ArtOrDet>violation</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a violation</ins> of freedom and breakdown of safety
One of the examples is the storage of bank account <del><Nn>number</Nn></del><ins>numbers</ins> in the tracking <del><Nn>chip</Nn></del><ins>chips</ins>. 
<del><Nn>Criminal</Nn></del><ins>Criminals</ins> could identify <del><Pform>it</Pform></del><ins>them</ins> easily by getting a small identifier anywhere and everywhere if the tracking proposal is approved. 
He or she could easily <del><Wci>touch on</Wci></del><ins>access</ins> the designated bank account since password cracking is an easy task for most hackers. 

Other than that, <del><ArtOrDet>safety</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the safety</ins> issue can be extended to personal safety. 
Everyone knows the <del><Mec>internet</Mec></del><ins>Internet</ins> and data transmission are very common and accessible at any time and <del><Prep>point</Prep></del><ins>point to</ins> <del><Others>such</Others></del><ins>examples such</ins> as Facebook. 
However, people tend to express their personal <del><Nn>feeling</Nn></del><ins>feelings</ins> and <del><Nn>idea</Nn></del><ins>ideas</ins> about sensitive issues on the <del><Mec>internet</Mec></del><ins>Internet</ins> unintentionally. 
This action could actually generate aggressive feeling from others and violent <del><Wci>movement</Wci></del><ins>acts</ins> could be <del><Wci>launched</Wci></del><ins>directed</ins> <del><Prep>onto</Prep></del><ins>toward</ins> the one with the aid of tracking <del><Nn>tag</Nn></del><ins>tags</ins> or <del><Nn>implant</Nn></del><ins>implants</ins>. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Internet</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The Internet</ins> can be a convenient source to <del><Wci>achieve</Wci></del><ins>find</ins> the name and basic information of <del><Wform>personal</Wform></del><ins>people</ins> if <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>the chip</ins> is hacked <del><ArtOrDet>and the </ArtOrDet></del><ins>and</ins><del><Rloc->tracking proposal</Rloc-></del><ins>tracking</ins> will facilitate the finding of designated <del><Nn>person</Nn></del><ins>persons</ins>. 

In addition, <del><ArtOrDet>the national</ArtOrDet></del><ins>national</ins> defense will be endangered if this tracking proposal is launched. 
The technology is based on the chip implant or tag. 
However, the chip implant can be retrieved <del><Wci>out easily</Wci></del><ins>easily</ins> and <del><Wform>replanted</Wform></del><ins>reimplanted</ins> onto other people and so on the tag. 
<del><Wform>Mischief</Wform></del><ins>Mischievous</ins> cases could actually cause <del><ArtOrDet>a chaos</ArtOrDet></del><ins>chaos</ins> on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do <del><Prep>it </Prep></del><ins>it with</ins><del><Wform>ill-intentionally</Wform></del><ins>ill intentions</ins>. 
For example, a wanted person can escape out easily from a country and hide in another country with this method. 
This tracking proposal creates a loophole in the net of <del><Rloc->justice rather than its original purpose</Rloc-></del><ins>justice</ins>. 

In a nutshell, surveillance technology may provide a lot of convenience <del><Cit>if</Cit></del><ins>if it</ins> <del><Vform>being</Vform></del><ins>is</ins> used appropriately. 
However, it <del><Wci>is fairly fragile</Wci></del><ins>has flaws</ins> which can be counter-used by criminals at <del><ArtOrDet>current</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the current</ins> level. 
I <del><Vm>would stand</Vm></del><ins>stand</ins> against the idea of tracking individuals given <del><ArtOrDet>its</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> vulnerabilities of <del><ArtOrDet>technology</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the technology</ins> at present. 

Nowadays, the improved <del><Rloc->human technology</Rloc-></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnology</ins> online is able to track different <del><Nn>location</Nn></del><ins>locations</ins> for different people. 
For instance, <del><Mec>face book</Mec></del><ins>Facebook,</ins> <del><Trans>as the</Trans></del><ins>the</ins> <del><Mec>well known</Mec></del><ins>well-known</ins> social media <del><Mec>platform</Mec></del><ins>platform,</ins> has the ability <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Wform>tracking</Wform></del><ins>track</ins> someone's location. 
However, <del><Wci>in some opinions</Wci></del><ins>for some</ins>, these auto-tracking services break the <del><Wci>rule</Wci></del><ins>principle</ins> of privacy. 
Some people do not want to be tracked as they feel it is not safe. 
In my opinion, the developed surveillance technology can be used to track people and objects only if the tracked person agrees to receive this service. 

There exist various advantages of using <del><ArtOrDet>the surveillance</ArtOrDet></del><ins>surveillance</ins> technology. 
The first example will be to track your personal items and <del><Wci>prevent from</Wci></del><ins>avoid</ins> losing <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>them</ins>. 
We all know that there is an application on iphone called where is my iphone. 
It basically <del><Vt>served</Vt></del><ins>serves</ins> to <del><Wci>allocate</Wci></del><ins>locate</ins> your iphone's position at any single <del><Mec>time,</Mec></del><ins>time.</ins> For instance, if someone left his phone in a certain place, he can check his phone's location by searching through the <del><Mec>internet</Mec></del><ins>Internet</ins> using another phone that has the same application if you are connected with your <del><Mec>friends'</Mec></del><ins>friend's</ins> device. 
You are able to find the location of your lost iphone by asking your friends as all the shared devices are able to see the location of each other. 

Another good example of using tracking technology will be to find <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> way to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> place that someone has never <del><Vform>being</Vform></del><ins>been</ins> <del><Rloc->there before</Rloc-></del><ins>before</ins>. 
For example, one person wants to visit his <del><Npos>friends</Npos></del><ins>friend's</ins> place in a new city. 
His friend is able to upload his location due to this advanced technology. 
Then, the person is able to use GPS or other auto-tracking <del><Nn>device</Nn></del><ins>devices</ins> to find the place <del><Trans>even</Trans></del><ins>even if</ins> he has never <del><Prep>gone to</Prep></del><ins>gone</ins> there before. 
The radio-frequency device can be used on old people whose memory is not as good as young people as well. 
For instance, when people <del><Vform>getting</Vform></del><ins>get</ins> old, they begin to <del><Wform>loss</Wform></del><ins>lose</ins> their memory and sometimes they may not remember their way <del><Prep>to home</Prep></del><ins>home</ins> or <del><ArtOrDet>other</ArtOrDet></del><ins>another</ins> place. 
If the old people always bring an auto-tracking device, it is much easier for the younger people to find them and it helps to guard the safety of the old people. 

Although the auto-tracking device is quite powerful, it still has to be used <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><Wform>volunteering bases</Wform></del><ins>a voluntary basis</ins>. 
Without <del><Wci>the agreement</Wci></del><ins>approval</ins>, people should not able to use this technology to track others. 
For example, if the tracking technology is able to track <del><Mec>everyone</Mec></del><ins>everyone,</ins> even strangers, this means your location at anytime is viewable to every single person online. 
<del><Pform>These</Pform></del><ins>This</ins> kind of situation will cause crime as thieves may <del><Mec>auto track</Mec></del><ins>auto-track</ins> you and you <del><Vm>are not</Vm></del><ins>would not be</ins> able to run <del><Prep>out of</Prep></del><ins>away from</ins> them. 
Therefore, we must <del><Rloc->agree with the statement</Rloc-></del><ins>agree</ins> before the technology is able to track us. 
At the same time, our location should be protected from <del><Vform>seen</Vform></del><ins>being seen</ins> by <del><ArtOrDet>the strangers</ArtOrDet></del><ins>strangers</ins>. 
All the <del><Smod>conditions</Smod></del><ins>conditions, like the time of tracking and who can view your location,</ins> must be <del><Prep>agreed</Prep></del><ins>agreed to</ins> by the person <del><Trans>that</Trans></del><ins>who</ins> <del><Ssub>agrees auto-tracking device to track him like, the time of tracking and who can view your location</Ssub></del><ins>is being tracked</ins>. 

In conclusion, the advanced technology gives people <del><ArtOrDet>convenience</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the convenience</ins> to find their items and <del><Spar>their</Spar></del><ins>ensures their</ins> safety. 
At the same time, people <del><Vm>must</Vm></del><ins>must be able to</ins> protect their privacy without <del><Wform>share</Wform></del><ins>sharing</ins> their <del><Wci>place</Wci></del><ins>location</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> strangers. 
Overall, the <del><Nn>benefit</Nn></del><ins>benefits</ins> of <del><Pform>these</Pform></del><ins>this</ins> <del><Nn>technologies</Nn></del><ins>technology</ins> <del><Wci>overweight</Wci></del><ins>outweighs</ins> its problems <del><Rloc->occurred if</Rloc-></del><ins>if</ins> people use it wisely. 

The increasing <del><Prep>in population</Prep></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulation</ins> of a country <del><Wci>makes</Wci></del><ins>gives</ins> the government <del><Rloc->taking more</Rloc-></del><ins>more</ins> difficulties <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><Wform>registers</Wform></del><ins>registering</ins> the members of each individual family and hence other factors <del><Vt>existed</Vt></del><ins>exist</ins> as an obstacle <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>country</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the country's</ins> development. 
By following the trend of improvement in technology, people can <del><Vform>now</Vform></del><ins>now be</ins> easily tracked by using RFID (radio-frequency identification) by simply <del><Wform>implant</Wform></del><ins>implanting</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a RFID</ArtOrDet></del><ins>RFID</ins> tags <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the human</ins> body. 
With this advantage, it will be easier for people to locate his friend or his family when they <del><Vt>lost</Vt></del><ins>have lost</ins> contact or in an <del><Wci>urgent</Wci></del><ins>emergency</ins> and also for police to investigate crimes. 

<del><Ssub>By taking an example in</Ssub></del><ins>In</ins> any country, there are crimes everyday and it is obvious to see that not all the culprits <del><Vt>had</Vt></del><ins>have</ins> been arrested and <del><Vform>being punished</Vform></del><ins>punished</ins>. 
There are <del><Wform>kidnaps</Wform></del><ins>kidnappings</ins> everywhere and not all of the <del><Nn>family</Nn></del><ins>families</ins> can afford the ransom <del><Vform>that</Vform></del><ins>that is</ins> <del><Wci>acquired</Wci></del><ins>required</ins> by <del><ArtOrDet>kidnappers</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the kidnappers</ins>. 
In that case, they would have no choice but to <del><Prep>seek for</Prep></del><ins>seek</ins> the power of loyal police. 
The detective will start <del><Wform>investigate</Wform></del><ins>investigating</ins> the first criminal scene and brainstorm for all the possibilities. 
<del><Um>Reality kills people in mind</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
<del><Wci>There</Wci></del><ins>It</ins> is only 10% of <del><Rloc->all the</Rloc-></del><ins>the</ins> time <del><Ssub>of</Ssub></del><ins>that the police</ins> successfully <del><Vt>pinpointed</Vt></del><ins>pinpoint</ins> the <del><Npos>kidnappers</Npos></del><ins>kidnappers'</ins> den and <del><Vt>arrested</Vt></del><ins>arrest</ins> all of them before they <del><SVA>starts</SVA></del><ins>start</ins> to harm the poor victim. 
In that sense, without a proper way to track human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins>, it is way too difficult to save <del><ArtOrDet>those</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> innocent life. 
Also, not only the kidnappers and the victim need to be tracked down, but also jailbreakers. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Few</ArtOrDet></del><ins>A few</ins> years ago, there was a jailbreaker named Mat Selamat, one <del><Rloc->of the members of the</Rloc-></del><ins>of</ins> terrorists of Osama, <del><Ssub>successfully</Ssub></del><ins>who successfully</ins> escaped <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> the monitoring of a couple of cops in Singapore. 
<del><Pform>That</Pform></del><ins>This</ins> was a rare case since Singapore is actually an <del><Wci>absolutely safe</Wci></del><ins>safe</ins> country. 
According to <del><ArtOrDet>news</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the news</ins>, the police force <del><Vt>had mobilized </Vt></del><ins>mobilized</ins><del><Nn>thousand</Nn></del><ins>thousands</ins> of <del><Smod>cops</Smod></del><ins>cops all over the country</ins>, each of them <del><Wci>prepared</Wci></del><ins>prepared to be</ins> on duty and patrol in an allocated <del><Rloc->place all over the country</Rloc-></del><ins>place</ins> and after few months, none of them was able to find Mat Selamat and <del><Vt>rearrested</Vt></del><ins>rearrest</ins> him. 
People fell into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but <del><Prep>keep</Prep></del><ins>to keep</ins> claiming that their country is still <del><Wci>in safety mode</Wci></del><ins>safe</ins>. 
If RFID comes into existence, this kind of <del><Nn>cases</Nn></del><ins>case</ins> can be totally avoided in no time. 

<del><Trans>Beside</Trans></del><ins>In addition</ins>, if RFID is supposed to be <del><Vform>use</Vform></del><ins>used</ins> by the public, everyone will be able to locate their friends and also their dearest family. 
Nowadays, people use the all-purpose smart phone for communicating. 
With the power of <del><ArtOrDet>internet</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the Internet</ins>, <del><Wci>there</Wci></del><ins>it</ins> is <del><Wform>nothing</Wform></del><ins>not</ins> impossible to find a friend for afternoon tea. 
In spite of that, <del><ArtOrDet>smart</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the smart</ins> phone is still a device that <del><SVA>need</SVA></del><ins>needs</ins> to <del><Vform>be recharged</Vform></del><ins>recharge</ins> its battery or else it will be just like a rigid object. 
Imagine when people <del><Vform>camping</Vform></del><ins>camp</ins> in <del><ArtOrDet>forest</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the forest</ins> or hills, they <del><Rloc->will just </Rloc-></del><ins>will</ins><del><Vform>lost</Vform></del><ins>lose</ins> all of the internet signal and <del><V0>also</V0></del><ins>also take</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> risk that their phone <del><Vform>running</Vform></del><ins>runs</ins> out of batteries. 
In that case, if they get lost or lose contact, they will be considered as <del><ArtOrDet>the lost</ArtOrDet></del><ins>lost</ins> <del><Rloc->and eventually</Rloc-></del><ins>and</ins>, they <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>may</ins> not survive.

Thus, <del><Wtone>let's</Wtone></del><ins>let</ins> us discuss the pros and cons now to give you a clearer <del><Wci>minds</Wci></del><ins>view</ins> of surveillance technology. 

Initially, surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> implanted into the <del><Nn>body</Nn></del><ins>bodies</ins> of animals. 
It <del><Vt>functions</Vt></del><ins>was used</ins> to track the path of animals and help in scientific research. 
Besides that, many animals which <del><Vt>just be</Vt></del><ins>were just</ins> released from the <del><Smod>protection of human for a long time</Smod></del><ins>long-term protection of humans</ins> <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> implanted <del><Prep>the</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> RFID as well to track their new life to ensure <del><Trans>whether</Trans></del><ins>that</ins> they could survive in the <del><Rloc->wild life</Rloc-></del><ins>wild</ins>. 

<del><WOinc>This technology are encouraged by some of the public that</WOinc></del><ins>Some of the public want to use this technology</ins> to implant <del><ArtOrDet>the RFID</ArtOrDet></del><ins>RFID</ins> into prisoners' <del><Nn>body</Nn></del><ins>bodies</ins>. 
The initial function is good <del><Ssub>indeed that</Ssub></del><ins>indeed:</ins> to track the <del><Nn>movement</Nn></del><ins>movements</ins> of <del><Pref>them</Pref></del><ins>prisoners</ins> to protect <del><ArtOrDet>the public</ArtOrDet></del><ins>public</ins> safety and interest if they are out of prison. 
However, some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view <del><Ssub>that</Ssub></del><ins>when they</ins> <del><Prep>object</Prep></del><ins>object to</ins> <del><Wci>and resist implanting </Wci></del><ins>implanting</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the RFID</ArtOrDet></del><ins>RFID</ins> into prisoners' <del><Nn>body</Nn></del><ins>bodies</ins>. 
Their opinions are founded on <del><ArtOrDet>the basic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>basic</ins> human rights. 
Prisoners' privacy is <del><Wci>endangered</Wci></del><ins>threatened</ins> due to the <del><Wci>RFID</Wci></del><ins>use of</ins>. 
After they <del><Vform>release</Vform></del><ins>are released</ins> from the prison, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their</ins> <del><Wci>movement of their whole life</Wci></del><ins>movements</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> controlled and known by the government. 
They feel <del><Wform>stressful</Wform></del><ins>stressed</ins> under the control of <del><ArtOrDet>government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the government</ins> and it may lead <del><ArtOrDet>to the </ArtOrDet></del><ins>to</ins><del><Wci>ways</Wci></del><ins>consequences</ins> that we do not desire and imagine. 

Furthermore, <del><Prep>some of</Prep></del><ins>some</ins> parents hold <del><ArtOrDet>the positive</ArtOrDet></del><ins>positive</ins> views <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> surveillance technology and <del><Vm>agree</Vm></del><ins>would agree</ins> to implant <del><ArtOrDet>the RFID</ArtOrDet></del><ins>RFID</ins> into their children's body. 
Their opinion is based on <del><Wci>the children safety protection</Wci></del><ins>protecting the children's safety</ins> <del><Um>and parents' guardian</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
Children <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be easily found if they are lost or abducted by other people. 
However, there are <del><Wci>both</Wci></del><ins>two</ins> sides <del><ArtOrDet>of </ArtOrDet></del><ins>of the</ins><del><Wci>stories</Wci></del><ins>issue</ins>. 
This technology leads to a problem which <del><ArtOrDet>is</ArtOrDet></del><ins>is the</ins> <del><Wci>same</Wci></del><ins>same one</ins> <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the prisoner <del><Mec>issue</Mec></del><ins>issue,</ins> that is <del><ArtOrDet>the human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>human</ins> privacy. 
<del><Spar>Children are given birth by their parents</Spar></del><ins>Parents give birth to children</ins>; parents are responsible <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><Wform>take</Wform></del><ins>taking</ins> good care of them. 
Although the initial <del><Wci>function</Wci></del><ins>reason for the</ins> of implementation of RFID is good for <del><ArtOrDet>the children</ArtOrDet></del><ins>children</ins><del><Srun>,</Srun></del><ins>;</ins> <del><Mec>however</Mec></del><ins>however,</ins> children also have <del><ArtOrDet>the human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>human</ins> rights and privacy which is <del><Wci>endanger</Wci></del><ins>threatened</ins> <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> this technology. 

Besides tags <del><Prep>into</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> human <del><Nn>body</Nn></del><ins>bodies</ins>, there is also the issue of <del><Nn>implant</Nn></del><ins>implants</ins> <del><Prep>into</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> products. 
<del><Wci>Recently</Wci></del><ins>Now</ins>, <del><Prep>many of</Prep></del><ins>many</ins> cell <del><Nn>phone</Nn></del><ins>phones</ins> are equipped with GPS which means that <del><Pref>they</Pref></del><ins>owners</ins> can find the device's location if it is lost. 
<del><Pform>It</Pform></del><ins>This</ins> is also <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> advance <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> surveillance technology.

Compared to <del><ArtOrDet>the human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>human</ins> <del><Nn>implant</Nn></del><ins>implants</ins>, tags on the products <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> better and more suitable. 
<del><Prep>Under</Prep></del><ins>With</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>products</Nn></del><ins>product</ins> tags, children are given <del><ArtOrDet>a significant</ArtOrDet></del><ins>significant</ins> free space as compared to the <del><Wci>congested</Wci></del><ins>restricted</ins> control <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> implant. 
Parents <del><Trans>also can</Trans></del><ins>can</ins> ensure the safety of children <del><Trans>as well as</Trans></del><ins>but</ins> <del><Rloc->do not</Rloc-></del><ins>not</ins> <del><Wci>endanger</Wci></del><ins>violate</ins> their privacy. 
It is the <del><Nn>ways</Nn></del><ins>way</ins> <del><Vm>that can</Vm></del><ins>that</ins> "<del><Vform>using</Vform></del><ins>uses</ins> one stone to kill two birds". 

In conclusion, based on the advantages and disadvantages discussed, I agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people. 
However, to a certain extent, I agree <del><Ssub>to</Ssub></del><ins>that</ins> <del><Wform>implant</Wform></del><ins>implanting</ins> RFID tags on products <del><Vm>to</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> protect the safety of children.

Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs the</ins><del><Wci>world pace</Wci></del><ins>pace of life</ins> becomes faster and faster, the need for maximum efficiency becomes stronger and stronger in every field.

For example, UPS can track the <del><Wci>process</Wci></del><ins>progress</ins> of each delivery. 
With <del><ArtOrDet>the information</ArtOrDet></del><ins>information</ins> about the location of the cargo, it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the company. 
RFID is one of the advanced <del><Nn>technology</Nn></del><ins>technologies</ins> for tracking. 
Due to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>its</ins> small <del><Rloc->size of the equipment</Rloc-></del><ins>size</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>and the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>and</ins> energy-<del><Wci>saving feature</Wci></del><ins>efficiency</ins>, it <del><Vt>becomes</Vt></del><ins>has become</ins> more and more popular in <del><Nn>industries</Nn></del><ins>industry</ins> and logistics. 
However, it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like <del><Nn>watch</Nn></del><ins>watches</ins> or clothes, <del><Trans>it</Trans></del><ins>even though it</ins> <del><Vt>did</Vt></del><ins>does</ins> provide convenience in <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> certain <del><Nn>situation</Nn></del><ins>situations</ins>. 

The biggest difference between <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> and animals or any other <del><Nn>objects</Nn></del><ins>object</ins> is that we have self-esteem <del><Trans>or</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> we need <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> basic respect from our <del><Nn>peer</Nn></del><ins>peers</ins>. 
One of the basic rights of <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> is the right for privacy. 
In any period of time, as long as we do not <del><Wform>offense</Wform></del><ins>offend</ins> others, we should enjoy the right of privacy. 
However, the idea of using RFID to track people violates our <del><Wci>need</Wci></del><ins>right</ins> for privacy. 
Since RFID tags attached to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> product can remain functional for a long period of time, <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> could be misused for surveillance <del><Wa>purposed</Wa></del><ins>purposes</ins> which are not related to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>industries</Wform></del><ins>industrial</ins> production or supply activities. 
For example, a consumer buys a product with RFID from a supermarket. 
As the RFID is embedded within the product, people who have the access to the information definitely can track him. 
However, the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag, <del><Ssub>so this action</Ssub></del><ins>which</ins> could reveal <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> sensitive information <del><Npos>of the consumers like</Npos></del><ins>like the consumer's</ins> home <del><Trans>address,</Trans></del><ins>address or</ins> <del><Wform>working</Wform></del><ins>work</ins> address to someone who is not authorized to get the information. 
If this piece of information is misused, chances are high that the consumer would suffer loss like financial loss or even <del><Wci>cause danger</Wci></del><ins>endanger</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> the life of the consumer. 
Moreover, if the product is what one needs to use <del><Mec>every day</Mec></del><ins>everyday</ins> like clothes or shoes, then the <del><Npos>location of one</Npos></del><ins>one's location</ins> will be revealed every <del><Nn>seconds</Nn></del><ins>second</ins>. 
This is just like there is an invisible stalker behind you. 
It is not only scary but also illegal. 
Although someone <del><Vm>would</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose, <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>the tags</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> still not appropriate. 
We can <del><Wci>think about</Wci></del><ins>consider</ins> this scenario: the location <del><Ssub>of </Ssub></del><ins>of where</ins><del><Pform>us</Pform></del><ins>we</ins> <del><Vform>going</Vform></del><ins>go</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> daily life will <del><Smod>be sent to a computer to be processed and stored every second</Smod></del><ins>every second be sent to a computer to be processed and stored</ins>. 
Does this sound reasonable to you? 
As <del><Trans>what</Trans></del><ins></ins> we have mentioned above, as human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins>, we should enjoy our privacy during our life as long as we do not cause harm to others. 
However, <del><Wci>RFID</Wci></del><ins>RFID in our purchases</ins> will violate our right of privacy <del><Rloc->during our shopping activities</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
Therefore, RFID should not be used to track people <del><Rloc->no matter</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> through human implants or tags on products.

Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs the</ins> society need surveillance or not? 
With the <del><Wform>developing</Wform></del><ins>development</ins> of modern society, more and more new technology <del><Vt>appears</Vt></del><ins>has appeared</ins> and people's <del><Wci>life qualities</Wci></del><ins>quality of life</ins> <del><Vt>rise</Vt></del><ins>has risen</ins> because of the new inventions. 
Some good examples such as the Internet, computers and satellites are now quite common <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> humans' normal life; however, some problems <del><Vt>also emerge</Vt></del><ins>have also emerged</ins>, with a concern <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> the loss of the privacy of civilians. 
In <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> modern <del><Mec>society</Mec></del><ins>society,</ins> privacy is a hot topic in peoples' <del><Nn>mind</Nn></del><ins>minds</ins>. 
Even if <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> safety is the most important thing to consider in normal life, many people still want to keep their privacy in spite <del><ArtOrDet>of</ArtOrDet></del><ins>of the</ins> <del><Wform>existing</Wform></del><ins>existance</ins> <del><Prep>some</Prep></del><ins>of some</ins> potential danger. 
The contradiction <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>between</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> safety and <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> privacy cannot be reconciled perfectly. 

With the <del><Wform>installing</Wform></del><ins>installation</ins> of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>surveillances</Nn></del><ins>surveillance</ins> <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> every corner of Singapore, people's life has <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> safe security, and criminals are deterred by these electrical instruments. 
A report shows that the crime rate in Singapore is the lowest in the world. 
This is because of two <del><Srun>reasons, one</Srun></del><ins>reasons. 
One</ins> is the strict law in Singapore, and the other is the dense <del><Nn>surveillances</Nn></del><ins>surveillance</ins> everywhere. 
During the year 2003, surveillance strategies helped Singapore beat <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> SARS and successfully prevented the spreading of the epidemic situation. 
At that time, Singapore government adopted the method to install <del><Nn>surveillances</Nn></del><ins>surveillance</ins> in every patient's home to look after their actions. 
Much <del><Others>media</Others></del><ins>media coverage</ins> has <del><Prep>reported</Prep></del><ins>reported on</ins> the effective measures of installing the <del><Nn>surveillances</Nn></del><ins>surveillance</ins> in Singapore. 
Without the <del><Wform>using</Wform></del><ins>use</ins> of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> surveillance, the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly, and the loss caused by SARS might be many <del><Others>times</Others></del><ins>times more</ins> than that in 2003 in Singapore. 
The benefits of the surveillance are obvious in the <del><Wform>fighting</Wform></del><ins>fight</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>against</ins> SARS, and this is a <del><Wform>success</Wform></del><ins>successful</ins> example of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> surveillance. 

Every coin has <del><Rloc->its</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> two sides. 
<del><Prep>In</Prep></del><ins>On</ins> one <del><Wci><del</Wci></del><ins>hand,</ins>><Mec>way </Mec></del><ins></ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> surveillance <del><SVA>help</SVA></del><ins>helps</ins> government guard civilians' property and <del><Srun>life,</Srun></del><ins>life.</ins> <del><Prep><d</Prep></del><ins>On</ins>el><Mec>in</Mec></del><ins></ins> the other <del><Wci><de</Wci></del><ins>hand,</ins>l><Mec>way</Mec></del><ins></ins> the surveillance makes people feel uncomfortable <del><Trans>under</Trans></del><ins>because of</ins> the 24 hours' monitoring. 
In the novel 1984, written by George Orwell, <del><ArtOrDet>author</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the author</ins> imagines a world in which people are being watched by <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>big brother</Mec></del><ins>Big Brother</ins> when they doing <del><Wform>everything</Wform></del><ins>anything</ins>. 
Every <del><Nn>words</Nn></del><ins>word</ins> people say can be heard by the government and because of that, <del><ArtOrDet>government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the government</ins> <del><SVA>know</SVA></del><ins>knows</ins> well about everyone's mind and <del><SVA>want</SVA></del><ins>wants</ins> to wash everyone's mind and control normal people totally. 
It is a country without any freedom and democracy in the novel. 
In <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> reality, people are afraid of being tracking everywhere, not because of <del><Vt>meaning</Vt></del><ins>intentions</ins> <del><Others>to</Others></del><ins>to commit</ins> <del><Nn>crime</Nn></del><ins>crimes</ins>, but the spirit of freedom and privacy <del><Ssub>is</Ssub></del><ins>that is</ins> in everyone's heart. 
When a husband is <del><Wci>talking</Wci></del><ins>saying</ins> a sweet sentence to his wife, <del><Wci>none</Wci></del><ins>neither</ins> of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>couple </Wci></del><ins>them</ins><del><SVA>want</SVA></del><ins>wants</ins> it to be heard by the people behind the monitors.

People <del><SVA>needs</SVA></del><ins>need</ins> a safe environment to live in, and also <del><SVA>needs</SVA></del><ins>need</ins> a private environment to stay independent. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The surveillance</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Surveillance</ins> is a useful method to keep <del><Npos>society's</Npos></del><ins>society</ins> safe, but also <del><Wci>kills</Wci></del><ins>affects</ins> the privacy of people in some degree. 
The best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life, and then <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> surveillance is <del><Wci>no</Wci></del><ins>not</ins> <del><WOinc>more needed</WOinc></del><ins>needed anymore</ins>. 
At that time, even if there is no surveillance above people's heads, there <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> <del><Nn>surveillances</Nn></del><ins>surveillance</ins> in everyone's heart and criminals <del><Wci>are</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> more <del><Wform>difficult</Wform></del><ins>difficulty</ins> to hide. 

Nowadays, humans live in a modern society. 
<del><Prep>Around</Prep></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs theAll around</ins> people, <del><Wci>there </Wci></del><ins>the world</ins><del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> full of high technology like CCTVs, <del><Wform>automatically</Wform></del><ins>automatic</ins> sorting <del><Nn>system</Nn></del><ins>systems</ins> for goods and different information systems. 
In order to bring more benefit and ensure people's safety, surveillance technology has been utilized <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> many <del><Wci>aspects of fields</Wci></del><ins>companies</ins> like in <del><Mec>UPs</Mec></del><ins>UPS</ins> and DHL<del><Srun>, these</Srun></del><ins>. 
These</ins> express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goods. 
It is convenient for <del><Wform>customs</Wform></del><ins>customers</ins> to track and confirm where and how their goods are now. 
However, besides tracking goods for people, people <del><Vm>begin</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> use this technology to track people. 
I do not <del><Prep>agree</Prep></del><ins>agree with</ins> this kind of <del><Mec>behavior,</Mec></del><ins>behavior</ins> because humans are different from <del><Trans>goods,</Trans></del><ins>goods and</ins> cannot <del><Spar>treat humans</Spar></del><ins>be treated</ins> as goods. 

There is no <del><ArtOrDet>a </ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins><del><Srun>doubt, tracking</Srun></del><ins>doubt. 
Tracking</ins> <del><Nn>system</Nn></del><ins>systems</ins> <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> brought many benefits in this information age. 
No matter where people go, taking bus or MRT, people are <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> the <del><Srun>CCTVs, it</Srun></del><ins>CCTVs. 
It</ins> is very important and useful to track and find people. 
Actually, tracking <del><Nn>system</Nn></del><ins>systems</ins> <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> provided people safety <del><Um>indemnification</Um></del><ins></ins>. 

However, tracking people <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> difficult and different from goods. 
For instance, a company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in Singapore, and is currently keeping <del><Wform>tracking</Wform></del><ins>track</ins> of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card <del><Mec>system-a</Mec></del><ins>system, a</ins> system which can be open to abuses such as an employee punching <del><Wci>the card for another</Wci></del><ins>another's card</ins>. 
Goods are dead, but humans are alive. 
If <del><ArtOrDet>one</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> company really uses this technology to track their employees, employees will <del><Others>dislike</Others></del><ins>dislike it</ins> and claim that their <del><Npos>humans'</Npos></del><ins>human</ins> right <del><Prep>and</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> privacy <del><SVA>have</SVA></del><ins>has</ins> been violated. 
In <del><Wci>another</Wci></del><ins>other</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>word</Nn></del><ins>words</ins>, people will feel that the boss or the company treats them like <del><Mec>goods,</Mec></del><ins>goods</ins> because modern people need <del><Rloc->more</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>homage</Wci></del><ins>respect</ins> not money. 
So, when employees begin to <del><Wci>conflict</Wci></del><ins>resist</ins> <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> this tracking system, they will find some ways to escape the tracking system like asking friends to help them to punch the cards. 
<del><Wci>Finally</Wci></del><ins>Eventually</ins>, the company tracking system has no meaning at all<del><Srun>, therefore</Srun></del><ins>. 
Therefore,</ins> tracking <del><Nn>system</Nn></del><ins>systems</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> very terrible <del><Wci>measure</Wci></del><ins>way</ins> to control people. 

In addition, <del><WOinc>tracking people</WOinc></del><ins>people tracking</ins> <del><Nn>system</Nn></del><ins>systems</ins> may be used by bad people in a wrong way. 
<del><Smod>How to explain this problem, it</Smod></del><ins>One problem</ins> <del><Wci>means</Wci></del><ins>is</ins> that people are not sure who <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> in charge of these tracking <del><Nn>system</Nn></del><ins>systems</ins>. 
For example, <del><Ssub>people</Ssub></del><ins>when people</ins> go somewhere, no matter taking bus, MRT or driving, they are <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> CCTVs. 
If some bad people want to track someone for their personal purposes, <del><Smod>by hacker technology, they can use </Smod></del><ins>they can hack into</ins><del><ArtOrDet>government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the government</ins> tracking system to do their own business. 
In other words, <del><ArtOrDet>government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the government</ins> originally <del><Vt>hopes</Vt></del><ins>hoped</ins> to use <del><ArtOrDet>tracking</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the tracking</ins> system to ensure <del><Npos>citizens</Npos></del><ins>citizen</ins> safety, now it has <del><Vform>been</Vform></del><ins></ins> divulged human information. 
It is very dangerous for society<del><Srun>, because</Srun></del><ins>, Because</ins> people do not know who <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> tracking them, it <del><Vm>must </Vm></del><ins>can</ins><del><Wci>bring</Wci></del><ins>cause</ins> citizens trepidation. 

In conclusion, <del><Trans>what</Trans></del><ins>as</ins> I have mentioned above, we have to <del><Ssub>agree,</Ssub></del><ins>agree that</ins> tracking <del><Nn>system</Nn></del><ins>systems</ins> <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> many benefits in different <del><Wci>parts</Wci></del><ins>aspects</ins> <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Wform>humans</Wform></del><ins>human</ins> <del><Mec>life</Mec></del><ins>life,</ins> especially in this modern world. 
But tracking people is very terrible choice<del><Srun>, it</Srun></del><ins>. 
It</ins> sounds like people invented a 'prison' to jail themselves<del><Srun>, people</Srun></del><ins>. 
People</ins> need <del><Wci>homage</Wci></del><ins>respect</ins> and freedom. 
Also tracking people is very dangerous if it <del><Vt>has been</Vt></del><ins>is</ins> controlled by bad men <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> a not good purpose. 
So <del><Mec>Surveillance</Mec></del><ins>surveillance</ins> technology should not be used to track people. 

Surveillance technology: A prospering technology 
Radio-frequency identification is a technology which uses a wireless non-contact system to scan and transfer the data from a tag attached to people or products <del><ArtOrDet>with</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs theAll aroundwith a</ins> radio-frequency electromagnetic field. 
After this, it can automatically get the identification and <del><Spar><del><Ot</Spar></del><ins>track the person or product</ins>hers>tracking</Others></del><ins></ins>. 

Nowadays, this technology has been used in many kinds of fields, such as transportation and logistics, transportation payment, product tracking and inventory systems, <del><Um>some institutions</Um></del><ins></ins> and so on. 
More interestingly, this technology is being used in human identification, even planting the chip into <del><ArtOrDet>human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the human</ins> body. 
This fact <del><Wci>becomes</Wci></del><ins>is</ins> very controversial among people and the possibility of personal information <del><Vform>releasing</Vform></del><ins>being released</ins> <del><Npos><del><A</Npos></del><ins>without the owner's</ins>rtOrDet>without</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>knowing</Wform></del><ins>knowledge</ins> also <del><Wci>brings</Wci></del><ins>causes</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Npos>public's</Npos></del><ins>public</ins> concern. 

In some fields, <del><Mec>Surveillance</Mec></del><ins>surveillance</ins> technology <del><Rloc->did</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><SVA>have</SVA></del><ins>has</ins> brought us tremendous benefit and advantage. 
Logistics and transportation are major areas of utilization for RFID technology. 
In <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> transportation, almost all of the people have <del><Rloc->transport</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> cards for daily transport. 
Since we do not <del><V0>to</V0></del><ins>need to</ins> bring cash to pay for the transportation fee, enormous time has been saved for everybody. 
For <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society, there <del><Vt>will be</Vt></del><ins>is</ins> a more efficient transportation system. 
For <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> logistics, if all <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> products <del><Vform>are</Vform></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>attached</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> <del><Prep>to </Prep></del><ins></ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> tags, it is much easier to count and record all the products. 
This will make the logistic process more effective and also prevent the occurrence of product <del><Wform>lost</Wform></del><ins>loss</ins> because of the tracking. 
Since <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> inventory management is very important for some <del><Nn>kind</Nn></del><ins>kinds</ins> of companies, this technology is playing a very significant role. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>super markets</Mec></del><ins>Supermarkets</ins> are also using this technology to tag their <del><Nn>product</Nn></del><ins>products</ins>, which can record the conditions of all of the products in time and prevent <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> stealing. 
When checking out, the price tag will be scanned to get the total payment very quickly. 
This will save the customers time and also improve the <del><Nn>profit</Nn></del><ins>profits</ins> of the <del><Wci>market</Wci></del><ins>supermarket</ins>. 

<del><ArtOrDet>The <del><Mec</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Libraries</ins>>libraries</Mec></del><ins></ins> also use this technology to identify the membership of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> people entering, which ensures the security and the member itself will also <del><Um>conserve their information made</Um></del><ins></ins> in this library. 
Both the library and museum apply this technology to avoid some belongings being taken out illegally. 
In some kindergartens, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> RFID is used to <del><Mec>tab</Mec></del><ins>tag</ins> the children to keep a record of their attendance and whereabouts. 
<del><Trans>On the condition that</Trans></del><ins>Because</ins> the kindergarten students are very young and they do not have a very sound self-<del><Wci>conscious</Wci></del><ins>awareness</ins>, this system can prevent them from <del><V0>lost</V0></del><ins>becoming lost</ins>. 

All in all, the RFID system is used to <del><Wci>catch</Wci></del><ins>capture</ins> the information of the object and <del><Others>track</Others></del><ins>track it</ins>. 
This function can be used in many aspects. 
<del><Prep>By</Prep></del><ins>With</ins> RFID, the customer who is <del><Wci>potential</Wci></del><ins>considering</ins> <del><Wform>to buy</Wform></del><ins>buying</ins> a very expensive <del><Others>luxury</Others></del><ins>luxury item</ins> will be less reluctant to consider <del><Wci>what if it lost</Wci></del><ins>the possibility of losing it</ins>, because <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> RFID can help them get it back. 
This will inversely improve the <del><Nn>sale</Nn></del><ins>sales</ins> of the shop. 
Although in many respects, this technology can be used in positive and evidently beneficial ways, in some <del><Nn>area</Nn></del><ins>areas</ins> it is so controversial. 

The most controversial part may be <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> human identification. 
It probably can be divided into several types. 
The first type is just say the ID card which is carried externally by the person. 
By using this card, our identities can be confirmed and the information <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> a certain institution can be kept. 
However, this will raise a privacy protection issue. 
How can it be guaranteed that our information will not be abused? Maybe this part can be resolved by using another technology
For example, the ID card can be implanted into a switch which can be controlled by the owner. 
When not using it, just switch off the card, then it will be just a useless <del><Wci>paper</Wci></del><ins>piece of</ins>. 
Another human identification is Implanting RFID chips into human body. 
For this part, not only <del><WOinc>the privacy problem is</WOinc></del><ins>is the privacy problem</ins> <del><Wform><del><Art</Wform></del><ins>a concern</ins>OrDet>concerned</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins>, <del><Trans>but</Trans></del><ins>but also</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> human health. 
<del><Wci>Does</Wci></del><ins>is</ins> the <del><Wform>implanting</Wform></del><ins>implanted</ins> chip definitely safe and feasible? Will it affect the normal functionality of the other organs? All of these problems are waiting to be resolved

In <del><Wci>solution</Wci></del><ins>conclusion</ins>, surveillance technology has been used in a much broader area. 
Some have been widely accepted by the public but some are not. 
Actually, this technology is very useful and should be definitely go on <del><Vform>be</Vform></del><ins>being</ins> used. 
What should <del><ArtOrDet>be</ArtOrDet></del><ins>be a</ins> <del><Wform>concerned</Wform></del><ins>concern</ins> is how it can be applied in the right area in a right way. 
If there <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> some controversy, how it can be <del><Mec>improved.</Mec></del><ins>improved?</ins> Only if it <del><Wci>be</Wci></del><ins>is</ins> <del><V0>made</V0></del><ins>being</ins> <del><Vform>use</Vform></del><ins>used</ins> in a wise and sensible approach and be adjusted and refined very profoundly, can it bring us the <del><Wform>maximized</Wform></del><ins>maximum</ins> benefit

In crime investigation, the truth of evidence is necessary, which can only be <del><Wci>made</Wci></del><ins>found</ins> <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> photos, videos or small <del><Um>tracks</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
<del><ArtOrDet>In </ArtOrDet></del><ins>In the</ins><del><Mec>supermarket</Mec></del><ins>supermarket,</ins> <del><Nn>monitor</Nn></del><ins>monitors</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> needed because we have to track thieves. 
In front <del><ArtOrDet>of</ArtOrDet></del><ins>of the</ins> <del><Mec>ATM</Mec></del><ins>ATM,</ins> we <del><ArtOrDet>need </ArtOrDet></del><ins>need a</ins><del><Wci>monitor</Wci></del><ins>camera</ins> to avoid intentional crime. 
We need CCTV in every public corner to track <del><Others>suspicious</Others></del><ins>suspicious behavior</ins>. 
Only in this way can we get evidence of bad <del><Wci>movement</Wci></del><ins>acts</ins> to protect others. 
The objective truth in CCTV is helpful and efficient in crime investigation, better than asking witness again and again to identify who is the <del><Wci>liar</Wci></del><ins>perpetrator</ins>. 

Secondly, surveillance technology can decrease <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> illegal actions effectively. 
Imagine there <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> no CCTV in public. 
People will act as if there is no supervision. 
No evidence is recorded. 
Cheating <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be very <del><Wci>popular</Wci></del><ins>common</ins> in <del><Nn>examination</Nn></del><ins>examinations</ins> and stealing <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> seldom incur punishment. 
In a Chinese kindergarten, <del><Mec>Children</Mec></del><ins>children</ins> <del><Vm>were</Vm></del><ins>could be</ins> always abused by a teacher but no one else <del><Vm>knows</Vm></del><ins>would know</ins> <del><Pform>that</Pform></del><ins>it</ins>. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Children </ArtOrDet></del><ins>The children</ins><del><Vm>told</Vm></del><ins>would tell</ins> their parents. 
Some parents <del><Vm>were</Vm></del><ins>would be</ins> too busy to take care of <del><ArtOrDet>children</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the children</ins> while other parents <del><Vm>did</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> not believe what <del><ArtOrDet>children</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the children</ins> <del><Vt>said</Vt></del><ins>had said</ins>. 
The headmaster <del><Vm>did</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> not know how the teacher really is and she <del><Vm>did</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> not fire her even <del><Trans>when</Trans></del><ins>if</ins> some children were afraid of entering the teacher's class. 
After so many children were abused, people <del><Vm>came</Vm></del><ins>would come</ins> to know the truth. 
<del><Wci>Shadow was made on children's heart</Wci></del><ins>The children's hearts would be shadowed</ins> and there is nothing we <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> do to make up for it. 
Now people suggest that every classroom in every kindergarten should have a <del><Wci>monitor</Wci></del><ins>camera</ins><del><Srun>, otherwise</Srun></del><ins>; otherwise,</ins> the teachers' <del><Nn>action</Nn></del><ins>actions</ins> cannot be supervised. 
If there had been a <del><Wci>monitor</Wci></del><ins>camera</ins> in the classroom, maybe parents and <del><ArtOrDet>headmaster</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the headmaster</ins> could <del><Vt>realize</Vt></del><ins>have realized</ins> earlier how severe and how bad the truth was and children could <del><Vt>get</Vt></del><ins>have gotten</ins> protection earlier. 

People may say that surveillance technology will be abused intentionally by authorized people. 
It really happened in China. 
In a car accident <del><Wci>related to</Wci></del><ins>caused by</ins> an official's relative, the record was modified with a new record. 
The person in the record had been changed with another one before it was released to the public. 
The modification was so obvious that people <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> easily recognize. 
In China, things like that will happen because the legal system is not sound enough. 
Power is concentrated in a few people. 
The problem of <del><Wform>abuse</Wform></del><ins>abusing</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> surveillance is <del><Wci>only</Wci></del><ins>actually</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> problem of <del><Wform>abuse</Wform></del><ins>abusing</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> power. 
Avoiding corruption and <del><Wci>separating</Wci></del><ins>decentralizing</ins> power is more important than forbidding surveillance technology. 

In conclusion, surveillance technology is necessary in many public <del><Mec>places</Mec></del><ins>places,</ins> in my <del><Mec>opinion</Mec></del><ins>opinion,</ins> because we need it in crime investigation and social issues. 
There is a truth that we cannot deny which is that surveillance technology can provide a sense of safety because sometimes <del><Nn>machine</Nn></del><ins>machines</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> more honest than people. 
We have to admit that <del><Rloc->how to</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Vform>prevent </Vform></del><ins>preventing</ins>the <del><Others>abuse</Others></del><ins>abuse of surveillance</ins> and <del><Rloc->how to</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Vform>use</Vform></del><ins>using</ins> it reasonably depend on a sound legal system, and <del><Ssub>it</Ssub></del><ins>that</ins> means surveillance has its own restriction. 

Surveillance technology such as <del><Mec>RFID(</Mec></del><ins>the modernwith.

This is more than convenient for the authority to <del><Rloc->take</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> better control of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society down to every individual. 
However, <del><Trans>with respect</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> of civil rights and privacy, surveillance technology such as <del><Mec>RFID(</Mec></del><ins>RFID (</ins>radio-frequency identification) <del><Vm>shall</Vm></del><ins>should</ins> not be used to track people. 

In the first place, every civilized person more or less dislikes the idea that he or she is being <del><Wform>close</Wform></del><ins>closely</ins> watched every second. 
By law, citizens have the <del><Nn>rights</Nn></del><ins>right</ins> to keep their <del><Wci>privacy</Wci></del><ins>private details</ins> <del><Wform>unknow</Wform></del><ins>unknown</ins> to public<del><Trans>, whereas </Trans></del><ins>; however,</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their</ins> privacy would be <del><Wci>exposed</Wci></del><ins>violated</ins> if such surveillance technology is applied widely. 
Many pupils in China have been complaining about their phones, because <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>through</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their</ins> phones <del><Rloc->at hands</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>, their lives are all transparent to their parents. 
Such technology would put people into the same circumstance as <del><ArtOrDet>those</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> pupils <del><Trans>where</Trans></del><ins>but</ins> the government plays the role of parents trying to find out whatever people are doing every second. 
If pupils feel uncomfortable being watched by parents, citizens definitely <del><Vm>are</Vm></del><ins>would be</ins> unhappy being watched by <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> big brother. 

Close surveillance <del><Wci>is</Wci></del><ins>creates</ins> not only <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> problem of <del><Wci>bad feelings</Wci></del><ins>unhappiness</ins>, but <del><Wci>also </Wci></del><ins>indicates also</ins><del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> <del><Wci>problem of the health of </Wci></del><ins>unhealthy</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
Some people may claim that it is good for security <del><Trans>as</Trans></del><ins></ins> when <del><Mec>every one</Mec></del><ins>everyone</ins> is under <del><Wci>tracking</Wci></del><ins>surveillance</ins><del><Srun>,</Srun></del><ins> becasue</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>those</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> poteintial criminals also are.

However, whether a behavior is a crime is dependent on the <del><Nn>authority</Nn></del><ins>authorities</ins>. 
When the <del><Nn>authority</Nn></del><ins>authorities</ins> <del><SVA>treats</SVA></del><ins>treat</ins> liberty as a crime, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society becomes terrible.

People nowadays would agree that it is terrible to live in those societies. 
Then why would they agree to put themselves into those societies? 
A worse thing is that one may not even be aware of <del><Rloc->that he or she is</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> being tracked. 
If such <del><ArtOrDet>thing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a thing</ins> does happen, then <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society would be moving on a dangerous direction without <del><Vform>being noticed</Vform></del><ins>noticing</ins>. 
Imagine that one day, one is suddenly arrested <del><Rloc->from his normal life</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> by the police and <del><Vform>tolded</Vform></del><ins>told</ins> that he is accused of posting anti-society statements on the Internet.

<del><Trans>As</Trans></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs theAll aroundwith aRFID (inBecause of</ins> the fast <del><Wform>growing</Wform></del><ins>growth</ins> of electrical technology, people have been trying to adopt more and more advanced technology into our <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins> to make full use of it. 
Many advantages have been shown in the areas like politics. 
Because of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> surveillance technology, more and more things <del><Vform>are</Vform></del><ins>being</ins> <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Wa>track</Wa></del><ins>tracked</ins> and more and more clues can be used. 
<del><Um>However, disadvantages have also been gradually disappeared as with the fruits people are enjoying</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
That is to say, there are more and more doubts raised by the public about <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> surveillance technology. 
From the view of my point, I think the application should only be authorized by people in some specific fields like politics and public security. 

Firstly, privacy will not be protected if everything is under <del><Wci>monitoring</Wci></del><ins>surveillance</ins>. 
We cannot imagine our every move <del><Vform>is</Vform></del><ins>being</ins> <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>track</Wform></del><ins>tracked</ins> and there may be someone who is staring at you from some place through <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> monitor. 
That sounds like we are naked in front of the public<del><Srun>, there</Srun></del><ins>. 
There</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> no <del><Nn>secret</Nn></del><ins>secrets</ins> <del><Trans>and</Trans></del><ins>or</ins> even privacy for us. 
Perhaps <del><Ssub>that</Ssub></del><ins></ins> the surveillance is installed for the sake of safety, but actually it conversely <del><SVA>make</SVA></del><ins>makes</ins> us <del><Wci>have a lack of </Wci></del><ins>less</ins><del><Wform>safety</Wform></del><ins>safe</ins>. 
Therefore, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> surveillance technology cannot be casually used. 

Secondly, it may be used by lawbreakers. 
There is no denying that every coin has two sides. 
<del><Others>The </Others></del><ins>same</ins><del><WOinc>technology also applies</WOinc></del><ins>also applies to technology</ins>. 
On one side, we can use it to ensure that something is under our control to reduce the <del><Wci>rate of crimes</Wci></del><ins>crime rate</ins>. 
On the other side, the technology <del><Vm>can also be probably</Vm></del><ins>could also be</ins> used by the <del><Mec>lawbreader</Mec></del><ins>lawbreakers</ins> to commit crimes. 
And once this happens, privacy does not exist any more and people's <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> under great <del><Wform>threaten</Wform></del><ins>threat</ins>. 
Therefore, this technology carries great risk <del><Trans>when</Trans></del><ins>if</ins> we can only see the advantages that <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> <del><Vform>been</Vform></del><ins></ins> appeared. 

Thirdly, it is also a waste of time and money if we use it in our daily life. 
<del><Sfrag>Say,</Sfrag></del><ins>Imagine</ins> a person whose salary is 2000 dollars per month. 
And he spends 1000 dollars to install <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> surveillance system in his house. 
Then if his house <del><Vt>got</Vt></del><ins>gets</ins> <del><Wci>stolen</Wci></del><ins>burgled</ins>, <del><Rloc->the</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> perhaps he can use the surveillance to get his money back. 
However, if nothing <del><Vt>happened</Vt></del><ins>happens</ins> inside his house, then the surveillance becomes useless, and he will also feel very uncomfortable because his every move is being <del><Wci>supervised</Wci></del><ins>monitored</ins>. 
Therefore, for ordinary people, there is no need for them to use this technology. 
Otherwise, it is just a waste of resources. 

From the reasons above, we can see that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> surveillance technology <del><Wci>takes</Wci></del><ins>brings</ins> great danger with it so that we cannot apply it to our daily <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins>. 
However, we can take the essence and reject <del><ArtOrDet>its</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> dross. 
That is to say, we can use it in some specific and special areas such as public security and politics. 
These fields are special because of the job category, and the need to be open to the public, so the disadvantages will not be <del><Wci>shown</Wci></del><ins>apparent</ins>. 
Contrarily, it can help to <del><Wci>supervise</Wci></del><ins>monitor</ins> <del><Prep>the</Prep></del><ins></ins> public figures in politics and track <del><Prep>the</Prep></del><ins></ins> offenders in security. 
Therefore, <del><Vt>the</Vt></del><ins></ins> surveillance technology should not be used except for some specific jobs. 

Surveillance technology such as Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to track the population is potentially <del><ArtOrDet>is</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modernwith.

It should therefore not be used to track the population in order to protect people's privacy and the idea of democracy. 

Using surveillance technology such as Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to track the population can be seen as merely progression from older technologies such as <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> identification cards. 
A possible benefit is better statistical analysis, which will provide the government with more information when drafting policies. 
However, in this very non-ideal world where corruption is <del><Wform>abundance</Wform></del><ins>abundant</ins>, wide usage of such surveillance technology and accurate tracking is potentially a dangerous, perverted and deadly weapon. 
<del><Wci>Illustrations</Wci></del><ins>Examples</ins> that <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> <del><Trans>both</Trans></del><ins></ins> hypothetical and yet concrete are action spy movies, such as the Bourne <del><Mec>identity</Mec></del><ins>Identity</ins>. 
In the movie, the spy agent accesses the public street cameras to track Jason's Borne whereabouts. 
This clearly illustrates how a <del><Wform>corrupted</Wform></del><ins>corrupt</ins> government may breach its civilians' privacy. 

In addition, <del><Wform>corrupted</Wform></del><ins>corrupt</ins> officials may sell this tracking information to the mafia. 
Misha (2008) explains in his book 'McMafia' that the shadow market accounts for 20% of the global economy. 
Judging from the crazy yet realistic anecdotes about gangsters, human traffickers, and the yukuza <del><Prep>from</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> his book, it is not difficult to imagine the opportunistic nature of human <del><Wci>taking opportunity</Wci></del><ins>desiring</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins></ins> this marvelous tracking technology. 
The people who are on the run from the mafia will be at risk! . 
Surveillance technologies should also not be used to <del><Wci>protect</Wci></del><ins>infringe</ins> people's liberty and freedom of opinion. 
The idea of democracy and power of the people will be at risk if people are tracked. 
The ability to track every individual will empower dictators and their secret <del><Nn>polices</Nn></del><ins>police</ins>. 
Already without these technologies, the secret police agencies are able to track their prey and unsuspecting rebels. 
An example is the <del><Wform>Nazis</Wform></del><ins>Nazi</ins> secret police <del><Ssub>of</Ssub></del><ins>that</ins> Hitler used to dispose (<del><Prep>their</Prep></del><ins>of </ins> bodies literally) and stamp out any of Hilter's <del><Nn>oppositions</Nn></del><ins>opposition</ins> using fear (and maybe guns, knives<del><Trans>,</Trans></del><ins> and</ins> poison). 

As previously mentioned there are benefits to <del><Pref>this</Pref></del><ins>these</ins> surveillance and tracking technologies. 
Trends of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> highly <del><Wform>emotionally</Wform></del><ins>emotional</ins> and easily manipulated humans can be tracked, <del><Wform>analysis</Wform></del><ins>analyzed</ins>, archived and chronicled. 
Trends of society and cultures can therefore be observed as a function of time. 
These statistical analyses will give governments more accurate information when drafting policies. 
An example of making an good informed decision is the story of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> planning and constructing <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> a walking path<del><Ssub>, where the</Ssub></del><ins>. 
The</ins> government has a lack of information and decides that the people <del><SVA>needs</SVA></del><ins>need</ins> a proper concrete walking path and builds one at a <del><Wform>randomly</Wform></del><ins>random</ins> location. 
However, they could have built the walking path on a dirt path that has been walked out by the people themselves. 
<del><Ssub>Knowing</Ssub></del><ins>If they knew</ins> that this <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> the <del><Wform>favorable</Wform></del><ins>favored</ins> route <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> the people, the government <del><Rloc->now</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Vm>has</Vm></del><ins>would have had</ins> sufficient information to build a walking path that truly benefits the people. 

Still the possible <del><Wci>downfall</Wci></del><ins>disadvantages</ins> of these surveillance technologies is too present in my paranoid mind and they clearly <del><Mec>overweight</Mec></del><ins>outweigh</ins> the benefits, in my opinion. 
It is therefore better to stick to the status quo. 

With the development of technology, we have more advanced <del><Nn>method</Nn></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs theAll aroundwith aRFID (inBecause ofamethods</ins> to track people in today's society. 
Surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) is frequently used by the police to track people who are considered suspicious. 
However, the <del><Wform>using</Wform></del><ins>use</ins> of surveillance technology is usually done secretly, and <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> debate has been <del><Wci>aroused</Wci></del><ins>generated</ins> <del><Wci>today</Wci></del><ins>recently</ins> <del><Trans>that</Trans></del><ins></ins> whether surveillance technology should be abandoned. 
Some socialists argue that <del><Wci>installing</Wci></del><ins>using</ins> surveillance <del><Nn>device</Nn></del><ins>devices</ins> on people <del><Wci>offends</Wci></del><ins>threatens</ins> human rights and should be totally abandoned. 
However, people who are <del><Wci>taking security job</Wci></del><ins>responsible for</ins> assert that surveillance technology is the most effective way to track people and <del><SVA>make</SVA></del><ins>makes</ins> it easier for them to track <del><ArtOrDet>those</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> suspicious people so that they can do their work much more effectively. 
<del><Prep>In</Prep></del><ins>From</ins> my point of view, surveillance technology should still be used to track people at present since there are no better solutions. 

The application of surveillance technology is the most effective method to track people and thus can help the police a lot. 
<del><Ssub>Although </Ssub></del><ins></ins><del><Pform>that</Pform></del><ins>This</ins> method may <del><Wci>invade</Wci></del><ins>violate</ins> certain people's <del><Nn>right</Nn></del><ins>rights</ins> and privacy, but in exchange for that we can get a safe and peaceful society. 
If <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> surveillance technology is abandoned, <del><WOinc>it <del><Vm>makes</</WOinc></del><ins>the police would have</ins>Vm></del><ins>would have</ins> the police <del><Wci>very</Wci></del><ins>more</ins> <del><Wform>difficult</Wform></del><ins>difficulty</ins> <del><Wform>to track</Wform></del><ins>tracking</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> suspicious people and <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> have little control of <del><ArtOrDet>those</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> people who are dangerous to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
For example, without surveillance technology, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>murders</Wform></del><ins>murderers</ins> <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> escape much more easily since no one <del><Vm>knows</Vm></del><ins>would know</ins> their position. 
Without surveillance technology, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> suspicious people might actually commit a murder and the murder <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be much more serious if the police <del><Vm>cannot</Vm></del><ins>could not</ins> arrive in time to help out. 
On the other hand, the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the <del><Wform>murders</Wform></del><ins>murderers</ins> and they might not commit more <del><Nn>murder</Nn></del><ins>murders</ins> since they might be afraid of being tracked by the police. 
If <del><Pform>that</Pform></del><ins>this</ins> technology is abandoned, it may <del><Wci>trigger</Wci></del><ins>influence</ins> more bad people to commit murder or <del><Vt>stole</Vt></del><ins>steal</ins> things since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not being punished by the law. 
Therefore, the continuation of using surveillance technology is really necessary. 

Although surveillance technology should not be totally abandoned, regulations of using <del><Pform>that</Pform></del><ins>it</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> expected. 
With the popularization of surveillance technology, <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> more concise and more complete regulations of using <del><Pform>that</Pform></del><ins>it</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> highly needed. 
For example, <del><Sfrag>making ordinary people </Sfrag></del><ins>ordinary people</ins><del><Vm>not</Vm></del><ins>should not be</ins> allowed to use <del><Pform>that</Pform></del><ins>it</ins> <del><Trans>and </Trans></del><ins>or</ins><del><Spar>do not let the surveillance <del><Nn>device</Nn></del><ins>devices</</Spar></del><ins>allowed to access surveillance devices</ins>ins> accessible to the ordinary people so that <del><Wform>abuse</Wform></del><ins>abusive</ins> usage of surveillance technology can be avoided<del><Ssub>, which</Ssub></del><ins>. 
This</ins> is also <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> effective way to protect human <del><Nn>right</Nn></del><ins>rights</ins>. 
Only <del><ArtOrDet>police</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the police</ins> should be allowed to use surveillance technology and such technology can only be used to help <del><Wform>tracking</Wform></del><ins>track</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>murders</Wform></del><ins>murderers</ins> or <del><Wci>people suspected</Wci></del><ins>suspects</ins>. 
With proper use of surveillance technology, <del><Pform>surveillance technology</Pform></del><ins>it</ins> can be a good tool for the police, and also benefit all <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 

It is unavoidable <del><Ssub>for</Ssub></del><ins>that</ins> some socialists <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Vt>argue</Vt></del><ins>will argue</ins> that surveillance technology <del><Wci>invade</Wci></del><ins>violates</ins> human rights<del><Srun>,</Srun></del><ins>;</ins> however, for the sake of <del><ArtOrDet>whole</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the whole</ins> society, surveillance technology should still be used. 
As long as the regulations <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> using <del><Ssub>that</Ssub></del><ins></ins> are obeyed, surveillance technology can serve as a good tool. 

In <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs theAll aroundwith aRFID (inBecause ofamethods</ins> modern society, public surveillance is becoming a normal phenomenon. 
In the United States, after the horrible attack on 11 September, the US <del><Mec>congress</Mec></del><ins>Congress</ins> passed the Patriot Act, which is mainly to increase domestic surveillance<del><Trans>, to</Trans></del><ins>as</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>counter</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a counter</ins> against <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>terrorists</Wform></del><ins>terrorism</ins>. 
<del><Trans>However, although</Trans></del><ins>Although</ins> these bureaucratic actions <del><Vt>prevent</Vt></del><ins>have prevented</ins> another similar attack from happening again, the act is widely criticized for its violation <del><Prep>over</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> individual privacy. 
With the development of surveillance technology such as RFID, <del><Wform>spy</Wform></del><ins>spying</ins> on the population <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> be much easier, which will create <del><ArtOrDet>even</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an even</ins> worse <del><Wci>scenery</Wci></del><ins>situation</ins> for <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> citizens. 
In this paper, the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>through</ins> the discussion of violation of privacy, the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the <del><Nn>authority</Nn></del><ins>authorities</ins>. 

First, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> violation of privacy will be dramatically increased. 
Typically, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> RFID tags are small devices with a read-only chip. 
The <del><Wci>regular</Wci></del><ins>usual</ins> distance of data exchange can be several meters. 
Once such <del><ArtOrDet>chip</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a chip</ins> is loaded with personal information and <del><Vform>implants</Vform></del><ins>implanted</ins> in individuals, all the information about his or her life can be recorded. 
Some supporters may argue that it will more convenient to use RFID for identification in <del><Nn>place</Nn></del><ins>places</ins> like <del><Nn>airport</Nn></del><ins>airports</ins> and <del><Nn>check point</Nn></del><ins>checkpoints</ins>. 
However, the fact is that such technology will create <del><Mec>check points</Mec></del><ins>checkpoints</ins> everywhere. 
Furthermore, such tracking <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> individuals is done without <del><ArtOrDet>permission</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the permission</ins> of the subject person. 
That is to say, people will be surveilled <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins></ins> every moment without <del><Npos>awareness</Npos></del><ins>their awareness</ins>. 
In such <del><ArtOrDet>situation</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a situation</ins>, individuals will lose their basic privacy. 

Second, when technology like RFID is widely used, there will be a trend to misuse such technology. 
An important feature of RFID is the minimal security. 
Since it is read-only, the card cannot protect itself. 
Moreover, almost every one can gain access to the card reader as the reader requires only simple technology. 
<del><Trans>Then</Trans></del><ins>Therefore</ins>, if a business man wants to defeat his competitor, he can just buy a reader and spy for commercial secrets. 
Hence, once RFID is widely used, people are very likely to spy on each other, which will destroy trust, respect and many moral values. 

Third, to use <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of the <del><Nn>authority</Nn></del><ins>authorities</ins>. 
The government is supposed to serve the people. 
However, once the government gathers too much power, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> democracy may be turned into totalitarianism, and <del><Rloc->such</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> surveillance technology provides the <del><Wci>measures</Wci></del><ins>means</ins>. 
Spying and collecting excessive information of individuals <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> the first <del><Nn>step</Nn></del><ins>steps</ins>. 
When <del><ArtOrDet>government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the government</ins> is able to find out all the precise information about its citizens, it can gradually <del><Wci>apply</Wci></del><ins>exert</ins> control over them. 
Consequently, the government is very likely to turn <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>into</ins> <del><Rloc->be</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> a totalitarian authority, which will be the worst <del><Wci>scenery</Wci></del><ins>situation</ins> and <del><ArtOrDet>tragedy</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a tragedy</ins> for every single citizen. 

All in all, surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track <del><ArtOrDet>general</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the general</ins> population <del><Trans>for</Trans></del><ins>because of</ins> the violation of privacy, the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the <del><Nn>authority</Nn></del><ins>authorities</ins>. 
Privacy must be respected, and power over <del><Nn>other</Nn></del><ins>others</ins> should be controlled. 
Without such surveillance technology, we <del><Vm>can </Vm></del><ins>would</ins><del><Wci>still live</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> a better future. 

With the development of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs theAll aroundwith aRFID (inBecause ofamethods</ins> science and technology, people nowadays are living under <del><Wci>various </Wci></del><ins>various types of</ins><del><Nn>surveillances</Nn></del><ins>surveillance</ins><del><Srun>,</Srun></del><ins>;</ins> for example, CCTVs can be seen almost everywhere in public <del><Nn>area</Nn></del><ins>areas</ins>. 
Recently, a <del><Wform>new </Wform></del><ins>newly</ins><del><Wci>coming</Wci></del><ins>developing</ins> surveillance technology called radio-frequency <del><Mec>identification </Mec></del><ins>identification,</ins><del><Trans>which is</Trans></del><ins>or</ins> RFID for <del><Mec>short</Mec></del><ins>short,</ins> has <del><Wci>caused</Wci></del><ins>generated</ins> heated discussions on whether it should be used to track people. 
Some people think RFID should be banned <del><Trans>out</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> of privacy <del><Nn>consideration</Nn></del><ins>considerations</ins>. 
However, <del><Mec>As</Mec></del><ins>as</ins> far as I am concerned, using RFID to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration, <del><Nn>rescue</Nn></del><ins>rescues</ins> and police <del><Wci>events</Wci></del><ins>activities</ins>. 

During scientific <del><Nn>exploration</Nn></del><ins>explorations</ins>, especially <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> geographical ones, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> tracking is very important. 
This tracking will help scientists to <del><Wci>better</Wci></del><ins>more easily</ins> get their <del><Nn>result</Nn></del><ins>results</ins> <del><Spar>and clear</Spar></del><ins>. 
Clear</ins> exploration route information will also be useful <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins></ins> post-research when scientists come back. 
In addition, people who research in biodiversity will also need to be tracked. 
When these scholars are on <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> field <del><Nn>journey</Nn></del><ins>journeys</ins>, they also have to relate their <del><Nn>observation</Nn></del><ins>observations</ins> with their route information; this is when RFID is of great significance. 
In addition, field journeys are sometimes very dangerous. 
Observers are likely to go into the rural forests or mountainous areas. 
Their safety may <del><Wci>face huge challenge</Wci></del><ins>be greatly compromised</ins>. 
For <del><Pref>this</Pref></del><ins>these</ins> <del><Nn>kind</Nn></del><ins>kinds</ins> of <del><Nn>situation</Nn></del><ins>situations</ins>, RFID will help a lot. 

Actually, not only for scientific observations but also during adventure journeys or travelling, RFID can <del><Wci>defend</Wci></del><ins>keep</ins> human beings from harm. 
Firstly, knowing where the travelers are and may going can assist them <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><Wform>know</Wform></del><ins>knowing</ins> what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change <del><Wci>directions</Wci></del><ins>routes</ins> to avoid <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> potential danger. 
Furthermore, by <del><Wci>telling</Wci></del><ins>showing</ins> the geographical position of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> people, RFID can accelerate the rescue process and will improve the survival rate of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> victims. 
During <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> rescue, every second is valuable! . 
RFID is also <del><Wci>functional</Wci></del><ins>useful</ins> in police <del><Wci>events</Wci></del><ins>activities</ins>. 
By <del><Wci>getting</Wci></del><ins>keeping</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> track of the <del><Mec>suspensors</Mec></del><ins>suspects</ins>, police officers can decide <del><WOadv>who the criminal exactly</WOadv></del><ins>exactly who the criminal</ins> is sooner and <del><Wform>easier</Wform></del><ins>more easily</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>gain</Wci></del><ins>learn</ins> the truth behind the <del><Wci>criminal event</Wci></del><ins>crime</ins>. 
Furthermore, knowing where the criminal is will also simplify the chasing process. 
Policeman can just go to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> certain place and chase the criminal. 
Besides, tracking <del><WOadv>people with potential danger</WOadv></del><ins>potentially dangerous people</ins> will be helpful for the safety department to predict <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> harm and better avoid <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>problem</Nn></del><ins>problems</ins>. 

Some people may argue that using RFID to track people will <del><Wci>leave out</Wci></del><ins>violate</ins> individuals' privacy. 
Nevertheless, the activities I mentioned above are <del><WOadv>related little</WOadv></del><ins>little related</ins> to privacy issues. 
Firstly, for scientific exploration, <del><Nn>rescue</Nn></del><ins>rescues</ins> and police <del><Wci>events</Wci></del><ins>activities</ins>, the privacy factors are far less important than <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> individual or social safety and scientific results. 
In addition, for observation journeys and traveling, we only need to use RFID on <del><Rloc->some</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> certain individuals and they will agree with this action for their own benefit. 

Above all, I think we cannot ban the use of RFID <del><Ssub>completely,</Ssub></del><ins>completely</ins> since it will be of great help <del><Rloc->for human's benefit</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> during scientific exploration, rescue and police <del><Wci>events</Wci></del><ins>activities</ins>. 
<del><Ssub>By using this technology reasonably, it</Ssub></del><ins>Using this technology reasonably</ins> will assist people to walk faster and further <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>along</ins> the long and rough <del><Wci>civilization developing path</Wci></del><ins>path of developing civilization</ins>. 

Not Being Imprisoned by Surveillance Technology

It monitors <del><Wform>anybody's</Wform></del><ins>everybody's</ins> movement or activity, and enables us to identify suspects involved in any misdoing which violates the law, etc. 
<del><Trans>When</Trans></del><ins>While</ins> surveillance technology like RFID brings lots of convenience to our life, some people argue that this kind of technology actually makes us feel unsafe. 
Personally, I think surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people, for the benefit it brings to me cannot match the concerns it causes. 

It has been quite a long time since someone <del><Vt>raises</Vt></del><ins>has raised</ins> the importance of the right of privacy. 
Without <del><ArtOrDet>doubt</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a doubt</ins>, surveillance technology <del><Wci>is going against</Wci></del><ins>violates</ins> the right since it leaks <del><Prep>out</Prep></del><ins></ins> people's information without getting their permission. 
When the technology is not so well developed, it may not be a big problem for leaking limited information. 
<del><Trans>While as</Trans></del><ins>As</ins> it becomes highly developed, it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tells lots of people where <del><Vt>did</Vt></del><ins></ins> you go and what <del><Vt>did</Vt></del><ins></ins> you do. 
It gives you the feeling that all people are watching a movie, and you are the hero whose every movement including using the toilet is under <del><Npos>others</Npos></del><ins>others'</ins> observation, just like what was showed in the movie The Truman Show which chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed world, broadcast to billions of people. 

When I have such feelings, I <del><Vt>will</Vt></del><ins></ins> feel that I <del><Vform>am</Vform></del><ins>do</ins> not <del><Vform>belongs</Vform></del><ins>belong</ins> to <del><ArtOrDet>human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the human</ins> <del><Wci>beings</Wci></del><ins>race</ins> <del><Trans>as</Trans></del><ins>like</ins> everyone else any <del><Srun>longer,</Srun></del><ins>longer;</ins> instead, I am like a pet or a tool to be made fun of by others. 
It is more like a prisoner's <del><Mec>life,</Mec></del><ins>life</ins> because we are under other people's control and we can do nothing to change our situation. 

<del><Trans>On the other hand</Trans></del><ins>Moreover</ins>, when we allow surveillance technology <del><Vform>being</Vform></del><ins>to be</ins> used to track people, it increases the <del><Wform>successful</Wform></del><ins>success</ins> rate of people <del><Wci>taking bad actions</Wci></del><ins>committing crimes</ins>. 
For example, thieves can easily find out the best time to visit our houses and kidnappers can take away our kids every time if they are informed of everyone's location. 
That will also cause more social concerns. 

However developed our society <del><Mec>is ,</Mec></del><ins>is,</ins> <del><Mec>Technology</Mec></del><ins>technology</ins> should always serve us as a tool instead of constraining us like ropes. 
<del><Wci>Every</Wci></del><ins>All</ins> technology is born with its advantages and its shortcomings just like nuclear power or weapons.

After a certain age, they will have to retire. 
The challenge of many ageing countries will <del><Wci>rise</Wci></del><ins>increase</ins> when no new generation could take over their place in that particular trade. 
First, I will discuss <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins></ins> the <del><Nn>challenge</Nn></del><ins>challenges</ins> of having an ageing population such as building more facilities and hospitals that will be needed when the population starts to age and jobs which have no young people taking over which can lead to economic downfall. 
Secondly, I will discuss the ageing population as an achievement <del><Trans>where</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> they <del><Vt>implement</Vt></del><ins>have implemented</ins> healthy lifestyles and good eating habits. 

When people start to age, many diseases will surface <del><Prep>up </Prep></del><ins></ins><del><Wa>un-noticing</Wa></del><ins>unnoticed</ins>. 
Therefore, for the welfare of the ageing population, more old age hospitals will have to be built. 
Land space will be limited when more <del><Nn>hospice</Nn></del><ins>hospices</ins> are <del><Vform>build</Vform></del><ins>built</ins> to take care of the elderly people. 
With illnesses surfacing and the increase in ageing population, increasing <del><Wci>amount</Wci></del><ins>numbers</ins> of nurses and doctors will have to be <del><Wci>present</Wci></del><ins>available</ins>. 
However, not many young people are passionate about helping <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society or even helping the elderly. 
Hence, the country will face a big challenge <del><Trans>as</Trans></del><ins></ins> to take care of the elderly. 
In addition, retirement is a must in some countries. 
This could cause a drastic fall in their economy <del><Trans>as</Trans></del><ins></ins> if the younger generation could not take over their work<del><Rloc->, no one will continue</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
It <del><Vm>is thus</Vm></del><ins>would thus be</ins> a big challenge to the country as there <del><Vm>is</Vm></del><ins>would be</ins> no one boosting <del><Npos>their</Npos></del><ins>its</ins> economy. 

The ageing population could be an achievement as this indicates measures are being implemented to <del><Wci>have</Wci></del><ins>encourage</ins> a healthy lifestyle <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the <del><Wci>people</Wci></del><ins>population</ins>. 
The more old people the country has, the more experience <del><Pref>they</Pref></del><ins>it</ins> will <del><Wci>be</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> as most elderly people can share their old experiences with the younger generation and <del><Wci><del><</Wci></del><ins>help</ins>Vform>making</Vform></del><ins>help</ins> them not make the same mistakes <del><Rloc->as them</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
This will help the country to move forward rapidly. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>more</Mec></del><ins>More</ins> exercise or any other forms of <del><Mec>work out</Mec></del><ins>workout</ins> can prolong the lifespan of people. 
It also indicates that the foods the people eat are nourishing and can decrease the amount of illness that can cause death, thus living longer. 
Food can be a big part of our lives. 
Eating the right amount of healthy or junk food can be a cause of having a longer or shorter lifespan. 
<del><WOinc>An example will be <del><Pr</WOinc></del><ins>Korea is an example</ins>ep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> Korea. 
It is said that kimchi can reduce the chances of having cancer and in addition, the people <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> have a good <del><Rloc->skin</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> complexion. 
True enough, their population is ageing but people there can live very long due to the food they are consuming.

<del><ArtOrDet>Ageing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs theAll aroundwith aRFID (inBecause ofamethodslivesotheranAn ageing</ins> population is a prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being <del><Wci>frowned upon</Wci></del><ins>discussed</ins> in most of the developed countries. 
As the standard of living increases, the affordability of high quality healthcare services and medical technologies, which have advanced over the decades, among the general public has become increasingly available. 
People of the <del><Others>nations</Others></del><ins>developed nations</ins> are likely to be well-taken care of, partly because of the various healthcare incentives and schemes provided by <del><Pform>the</Pform></del><ins>their</ins> respective <del><Nn>government</Nn></del><ins>governments</ins>. 
In the <del><Others>following</Others></del><ins>following paragraphs</ins>, I will take Singapore as the case study as a reference to my discussion. 

Rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can be a <del><Wtone>pro</Wtone></del><ins>benefit</ins> to <del><Nn>family</Nn></del><ins>families</ins> <del><Rloc->affairs</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
There is a Chinese saying that goes, "Jia you yi lao, ru you yi bao". 
This means, having an <del><Others>elderly</Others></del><ins>elderly person</ins> at home is equivalent to having <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> gold at home. 
Where every home houses an <del><Others>elderly</Others></del><ins>elderly person</ins>, the future generations can learn and carry on their traditional and <del><Wform>morale</Wform></del><ins>moral</ins> values. 
Where filial piety and respect for the <del><Wform>elder</Wform></del><ins>elderly</ins> are highly emphasized in Chinese traditions, the children can learn to respect and interact with their grandparents from a young age and <del><Trans>so as</Trans></del><ins>also</ins> <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> their parents. 
With good communication and interaction, an <del><Others>elderly</Others></del><ins>elderly person</ins> can guide the young with valuable lessons in life. 
An individual is an unit of the society, every good individual thus is a precious contribution to the <del><Npos>society</Npos></del><ins>society's</ins> and nation's growth. 

On the other <del><Mec>hand ,</Mec></del><ins>hand,</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> rising life expectancy can also be an indication, though not entirely, of a country's <del><Wci>reputation</Wci></del><ins>responsibility</ins> to their citizens. 
A long-lived and healthy individual is sometimes <del><Vform>being</Vform></del><ins></ins> related to the good standard of living and healthcare services that one <del><Vt>received</Vt></del><ins>has received</ins>. 
In <del><Wci>another</Wci></del><ins>other</ins> words, it indicates that the national healthcare system is <del><Trans>effective,</Trans></del><ins>effective and</ins> well-managed by the Government. 
This gives <del><Nn>credits</Nn></del><ins>credit</ins> to the Government's medical and healthcare schemes. 
Thus, rising life expectancy can be seen as an achievement of the Government's well-planned or managed schemes. 
However, this <del><Vm>shall</Vm></del><ins>should</ins> not be entangled with the idea that high life expectancy equates <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> a nation's provision of quality healthcare benefits and <del><Wci>livings</Wci></del><ins>support</ins> for <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> senior citizens. 

<del><ArtOrDet>Ageing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>An ageing</ins> population is often viewed negatively by <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> developed countries <del><Ssub>where they</Ssub></del><ins>that </ins> are <del><Wform>economic</Wform></del><ins>economically</ins> <del><Wci>driven</Wci></del><ins>oriented</ins>. 
In order to cope with <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> ageing population that pulls down or hinders <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> economic development, more physically capable and young <del><Wci>workforces</Wci></del><ins>workers</ins> are required in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
If <del><Ssub>failed to fulfil this requirement</Ssub></del><ins>this requirement is not fulfilled</ins>, this will lead to more financial <del><Nn>strains</Nn></del><ins>strain</ins> such as increased <del><Nn>tax</Nn></del><ins>taxes</ins> imposed on <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Um>societal or company working groups</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
This can cause more societal issues such as lower satisfaction of <del><Wci>working groups</Wci></del><ins>workers</ins> towards the government, decreasing birth rates <del><Trans>where</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> people could not afford the <del><WOinc>children expenses of their</WOinc></del><ins>expenses of their children's</ins> <del><Nn>upbringings</Nn></del><ins>upbringing</ins> and educational fees, <del><Ssub>that</Ssub></del><ins>which</ins> adds on more burdens and worries for the government.

It is a challenge <del><Trans>where </Trans></del><ins>when</ins><del><ArtOrDet>this</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> illness <del><Wtone>can't</Wtone></del><ins>cannot</ins> be easily avoided by any person <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> <del><Rloc->such</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> a stressful lifestyle <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> any place in the world.

When a person grows old, the medical needs of <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> person increase over the years relative to the age of <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> person. 
The number and types of illness also <del><SVA>increases</SVA></del><ins>increase</ins> relative to the age too. 
This is particularly seen in many parts of the <del><Sfrag>world.

The ability to eliminate <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> illness is considered as an achievement as this proves that the ability of the human race to research and develop the medical <del><Nn>ability</Nn></del><ins>abilities</ins> to <del><Wci>solve</Wci></del><ins>cure</ins> and <del><Spar>eliminated</Spar></del><ins>eliminate</ins> the <del><Wci>harm</Wci></del><ins>illnesses</ins> that <del><Vt><d</Vt></del><ins>were</ins>el><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins></ins> able to take the life of a human <del><Prep>away</Prep></del><ins></ins> at a earlier age.

Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs theAll aroundwith aRFID (inBecause ofamethodslivesotheranAn ageingexpectancy</ins> can be considered both a challenge and an achievement. 
We should separate it into two aspects. 
The first one is that rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can be considered <del><Trans>as</Trans></del><ins></ins> a challenge. 
The second one is that rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can also be considered an achievement. 
They are not contradicting <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> each other. 
In my opinion, the challenge <del><Um>interception is to make comparison in the cross direction</Um></del><ins></ins>, which is comparing the current situation with the assumed situation. 
On the other hand, the achievement <del><Um>perceiving is to make comparison in the wire direction</Um></del><ins></ins>, which is comparing the current situation with the historical situation in the past. 
So, in the <del><Others>following</Others></del><ins>following paragraphs</ins>, I will clarify these two different views <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins>. 

For the first part, rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is a challenge. 
We <del><Vm>should </Vm></del><ins>can</ins><del><Wform>image</Wform></del><ins>imagine</ins> that when the life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>raises</ins> <del><Vform>raised </Vform></del><ins></ins><del><Prep>up</Prep></del><ins></ins><del><Ssub>;</Ssub></del><ins>,</ins> this will mean that the average age <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> the population <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Spar>nation</Spar></del><ins>nationally</ins> <del><Rloc->wise</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> or globally is also rising. 
The number of the older people will increase to make the average life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> higher. 
For these older people, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society <del><SVA>need</SVA></del><ins>needs</ins> <del><Mec>man power</Mec></del><ins>manpower</ins> and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them. 
Sometimes, <del><Others>older</Others></del><ins>older people</ins> need more <del><Mec>man power</Mec></del><ins>manpower</ins> and resources than normal young people. 
<del><Trans>However</Trans></del><ins>Moreover</ins>, these older people usually contribute less or <del><WOadv>nearly have</WOadv></del><ins>have nearly</ins> no productivity <del><Prep>for </Prep></del><ins>in</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
We have to say that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> older people are becoming a <del><Mec>black hole</Mec></del><ins>blackhole</ins> for the entire society in terms of <del><Mec>man power</Mec></del><ins>manpower</ins> and resources. 
So the dilemma <del><Wci>takes place</Wci></del><ins>occurs</ins> when there are more people who have a higher age. 
Not only <del><Vform>has</Vform></del><ins></ins> the <del><Wci>family member</Wci></del><ins>families</ins> of the old people, but also the government <del><Vt>needed</Vt></del><ins>need</ins> to <del><Wci>spend</Wci></del><ins>put</ins> a lot of effort <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>into</ins> <del><Wform>handle</Wform></del><ins>handling</ins> such <del><ArtOrDet>situation</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a situation</ins>. 
This is the interpretation of <del><ArtOrDet>challenge</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the challenge</ins> <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins>. 

For the second part, rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is also an achievement. 
The achievement is <del><Prep>some kind of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> comparison with <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> history in the past. 
In <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> ancient <del><Nn>time</Nn></del><ins>times</ins>, due to the <del><Wci>less</Wci></del><ins>lower</ins> development of science and technology, people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> healthy. 
<del><Mec>Hence</Mec></del><ins>Hence,</ins> people died of various diseases. 
On the other hand, there <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> not sufficient materials or ways to improve people's daily life. 
People <del><Vt>do</Vt></del><ins>did</ins> not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed <del><Rloc->tooth</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
These small things <del><Vt>makes</Vt></del><ins>made</ins> the quality of people's life less enjoyable than today. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Bad</ArtOrDet></del><ins>A bad</ins> mood cannot give them a longer <del><Rloc->time of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> life. 
Due to all these reasons, people died quite early, which <del><Vt>results</Vt></del><ins>resulted</ins> in a <del><Wform>low</Wform></del><ins>lower</ins> life expectancy. 
So, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> <del><WOinc>mark for how <del><W</WOinc></del><ins></ins>form>long</Wform></del><ins>longer</ins> is <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> life expectancy <del><Vform>is indicating</Vform></del><ins>indicates</ins> how well people <del><Vform>is living</Vform></del><ins>live</ins>. 
In that sense, rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement. 

From these points, we <del><Rloc->ourselves</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> should be glad that we can live longer and enjoy a better living environment. 
Besides, we should not forget the responsibility on our <del><Nn>shoulder</Nn></del><ins>shoulders</ins>, the older people. 
We should try our best to take care of them as if we are the ones who are old. 
In such a situation, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society can develop in a harmonious and healthy way. 
We just take the challenge and enjoy the achievement. 

As the world is at the turning point of entering into a stage where people are constantly and notably older than before, <del><Smod>how to make life easier, <del><Spar>comfortable</Spar></del><ins>more comforta</Smod></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs theAll aroundwith aRFID (inBecause ofamethodslivesotheranAn ageingexpectancythere is a need to shed light on how to make life easier, more comfortable as well as healthier</ins>ble</ins> as well as <del><Spar>healthy</Spar></del><ins>healthier</ins> has been shed light on. 
Life expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree <del><Others>is</Others></del><ins>there is</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> population ageing problem. 
However, there are situations where we have to consider <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievement. 

Rising life expectancy is a challenge in <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> sense that it is highly <del><Wform>relied</Wform></del><ins>reliant</ins> on <del><ArtOrDet>development</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the development</ins> of <del><Wci>medication</Wci></del><ins>medicine</ins>. 
There are a series of diseases that <del><SVA>hinders</SVA></del><ins>hinder</ins> longevity. 
Cancers, <del><Ssub>as</Ssub></del><ins></ins> a major group of killing diseases, is often beyond current <del><Wci>medication</Wci></del><ins>medicine</ins> to get fully <del><Wci>healed</Wci></del><ins>cured</ins>. 
<del><Trans>Once</Trans></del><ins>If</ins> cancers are <del><WOadv>too late to discovered</WOadv></del><ins>discovered too late</ins>, one is <del><Wci>deemed</Wci></del><ins>doomed</ins> to death at a later stage. 
Other <del><Mec>diseases</Mec></del><ins>diseases,</ins> such as mental <del><Nn>disorder</Nn></del><ins>disorders</ins> and heart <del><Mec>trouble</Mec></del><ins>trouble,</ins> are also top killers, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> current <del><Wci>medication</Wci></del><ins>medicine</ins> does have methods to treat <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>patient</Nn></del><ins>patients</ins>, but risks still come along. 
Apart from <del><ArtOrDet>diseases</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the diseases</ins> themselves, deficiency <del><Prep>of </Prep></del><ins>in</ins><del><Wci>medication</Wci></del><ins>medical</ins> system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also <del><Wci>restrict</Wci></del><ins>combine</ins> to make lifespan <del><Wci>longer</Wci></del><ins>shorter</ins>. 
Patients in many developing and less developed countries, especially African countries, are suffering from simple and easy-to-<del><Wci>heal</Wci></del><ins>cure</ins> diseases such as cold and flu and probably at the end of the <del><Mec>day</Mec></del><ins>day,</ins> it becomes the end of their life, <del><Trans>albeit</Trans></del><ins>although</ins> they could have been treated <del><Wform>well</Wform></del><ins>better</ins> if they were in a country <del><ArtOrDet>where</ArtOrDet></del><ins>where the</ins> <del><Wci>medication</Wci></del><ins>medical</ins> system <del><Vt>has been</Vt></del><ins>is</ins> <del><Wform>completed</Wform></del><ins>complete</ins> and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people. 
To raise life expectancy, one of the questions is how to upgrade the current <del><Wci>medication</Wci></del><ins>medical</ins> system. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The government</ins> should help encourage <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> breakthroughs as well as <del><ArtOrDet>complete</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a complete</ins> <del><Wci>medication</Wci></del><ins>medical</ins> system. 

Rising life expectancy is also an achievement. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Development</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The development</ins> of technology is making our life easier and more comfortable. 
Compared with the world of ancient Rome or China where almost no machines <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> <del><Wci>involved</Wci></del><ins>used</ins>, people nowadays are producing batches and batches of <del><Nn>merchandises</Nn></del><ins>merchandise</ins> in factories. 
Machines have replaced <del><Rloc->a bunch of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> coolies and heavy labor. 
Cars and trucks <del><Vt>diminish</Vt></del><ins>have diminished</ins> the <del><Wci>redundancy</Wci></del><ins>transit time</ins> of long <del><Wci>time</Wci></del><ins>distance</ins> shipment. 
As a result, people have more time to <del><ArtOrDet>enjoy</ArtOrDet></del><ins>enjoy the</ins> <del><Nn>advantage</Nn></del><ins>advantages</ins> of modern life. 
One can easily travel to the other half of the globe to see beautiful scenery that one <del><Prep>dreams</Prep></del><ins>dreams of</ins> for <del><ArtOrDet>his</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> lifetime. 
One can also easily see <del><ArtOrDet>his</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> deeply loved one <del><ArtOrDet>through </ArtOrDet></del><ins>through the</ins><del><Mec>internet</Mec></del><ins>Internet</ins> from miles away. 
More importantly, they can share their ideas of how to keep healthy <del><ArtOrDet>through</ArtOrDet></del><ins>through the</ins> Internet, to make more interested people get <del><Vform>involve</Vform></del><ins>involved</ins> and find ways to make life longer and more wonderful. 
The development of technology brings people joy<del><Trans>, </Trans></del><ins> and</ins><del><Spar>making</Spar></del><ins>makes</ins> things easier and this may be one of the achievements. 

In conclusion, it is <del><Wform>delighted</Wform></del><ins>delightful</ins> to observe the fact that life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> rising, but one must have the idea in mind <del><ArtOrDet>that</ArtOrDet></del><ins>that a</ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is never easy. 
There are a series of problems that <del><SVA>hinders</SVA></del><ins>hinder</ins> longevity such as current <del><Wci>medication</Wci></del><ins>medicine</ins>. 
But data <del><Ssub>that </Ssub></del><ins></ins><del><SVA>shows</SVA></del><ins>show</ins> the <del><Wform>rising</Wform></del><ins>rise</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is indeed an achievement that reveals the improvement of modern life. 
As for the future, who knows? We are on the right track
Probably the next breakthrough is around the corner in the near future. 

In recents decedes, it is a trend that people are able to live a longer life. 
This is due to the improvements and breakthroughs in the realm of <del><Wci>medication</Wci></del><ins>the modernwith. 
Productstechnologyplacesemergingdoestypesof thetechnologypopulationadvancedAs theAll aroundwith aRFID (inBecause ofamethodslivesotheranAn ageingexpectancythere is a need to shed light on how to make life easier, more comfortable as well as healthiermedicine</ins> and people's living condition. 
While it is applaudable that people <del><Vt>achieved</Vt></del><ins>have achieved</ins> great success in prolonging their lives, there are social challenges <del><Mec>posted</Mec></del><ins>posed</ins> by <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins>. 

Without a doubt, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> rising life expectancy is definitely a success in human history as it shows the achievements of the medical <del><Wci>industries</Wci></del><ins>field</ins> in finding out ways and medicines to treat diseases that were thought to be incurable in the past and providing people with vaccines to prevent diseases. 
The condition of the living environment <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>has</ins> also improved that people are able to live in more hyginenic places. 
The improvement in technology also eases people's lives by replacing all the manual <del><Wform>labourous</Wform></del><ins>labour</ins> <del><Rloc->works</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> with easy and simple machine <del><Rloc->operative </Rloc-></del><ins></ins><del><Nn>works</Nn></del><ins>work</ins>. 
Due to the three major factors stated above, people are no longer exposed to disease-breeding living environments, are able to cure <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> diseases considered fatal <del><Wci>last time</Wci></del><ins>previously</ins> and do not need to do much labourous work. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The rising</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Rising</ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expetancy</ins> best <del><SVA>prove</SVA></del><ins>proves</ins> these improvements and <del><SVA>have</SVA></del><ins>has</ins> definitely written a new chapter <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the <del><Prep>history</Prep></del><ins>history of</ins> human civilisation. 

However, as life expectancy <del><Vt>rises</Vt></del><ins>has risen</ins>, some social challenges <del><Vt>occurred</Vt></del><ins>have occurred</ins> as well. 
As the aging population grows, the young and more energetic people are subject to <del><Wform>support</Wform></del><ins>supporting</ins> more people of old age. 
This creates a huge social burden <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> them and might cause some of them <del><Prep>leave</Prep></del><ins>to leave</ins> the country when the burden becomes unbearable. 
This would result in <del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins><del><Wform>lose</Wform></del><ins>loss</ins> of manpower in <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> country. 
Another aspect <del><Vm>would</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be that <del><Trans>as</Trans></del><ins>if</ins> the young people feel it is hard to feed the old people in their families and themselves, they would choose not to give birth to any child in order to reduce the burdens on themselves. 
This would result in <del><ArtOrDet>decrease</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a decrease</ins> in birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem<del><Mec>,especially</Mec></del><ins>, especially</ins> in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The government</ins> will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare of the old people because they are in urgent need of it. 
Less money will be left to develop the country and explore <del><Prep>into</Prep></del><ins></ins> new areas of business. 
This would result in economic retardation and stagnation of a country. 

Afterall, it might seem difficult to handle when the aging population of a country grows, especially the developed countries with <del><ArtOrDet>very</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a very</ins> small population. 
However, when we look at the brighter side of the reality, the rise in life expectancy <del><Wci>proves</Wci></del><ins>shows</ins> great improvements in various realms and <del><Wform>solved</Wform></del><ins>solutions</ins> <del><Prep>many</Prep></del><ins>to many</ins> problems we had in the <del><Srun>past, there</Srun></del><ins>past. 
There</ins> is hope that the aging population may transform into <del><ArtOrDet>helpful</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a helpful</ins> force to <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> country in the future with the help of better technology and medication. 

Life expectancy can be defined as <del><ArtOrDet>desired</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modernwith.

On the other hand, people demand better quality of service and advanced technology such <del><ArtOrDet>as</ArtOrDet></del><ins>as the</ins> newer I-Pad model. 
In fact, these rising demands require a stronger <del><Wform>working force</Wform></del><ins>workforce</ins> who is active and <del><Wci>higher</Wci></del><ins>more</ins> productive than <del><Prep>the</Prep></del><ins>in the</ins> past. 
However, <del><ArtOrDet>ageing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the aging</ins> population is <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> <del><WOadv>phenomenon opposite</WOadv></del><ins>opposite phenomenon</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Pform>it</Pform></del><ins></ins>. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Ageing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>An ageing</ins> population leads to a working force composed <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>larger</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a larger</ins> percentage of <del><Wform>elders</Wform></del><ins>elderly</ins> who <del><Wci>are</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> lower productivity and <del><V0>thus</V0></del><ins>are thus</ins> unable to meet the expectancy. 

The second life expectancy is increased medical technology and <del><Wci>sources</Wci></del><ins>resources</ins>. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Ageing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>An ageing</ins> population requires more medical <del><Wci>sources</Wci></del><ins>resources</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>since</ArtOrDet></del><ins>since the</ins> <del><Wform>elders</Wform></del><ins>elderly</ins> needs more medical attention. 
However, the health level <del><ArtOrDet>of </ArtOrDet></del><ins>of the</ins><del><Wci>world</Wci></del><ins>global</ins> population shows an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it leads to exponential growth in <del><ArtOrDet>number</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the number</ins> of elders worldwide. 
Nevertheless, provision of more medicine and better <del><Nn>equipments</Nn></del><ins>equipment</ins> as well as more medical <del><Nn>centre</Nn></del><ins>centres</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> necessary to accommodate <del><ArtOrDet>these </ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins><del><Wform>elders</Wform></del><ins>elderly</ins>. 

Another rising life expectancy is a bigger house with a lower price which is <del><Wci>raised</Wci></del><ins>desired</ins> <del><Prep>up</Prep></del><ins></ins> by <del><ArtOrDet>younger</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the younger</ins> generation. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Ageing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>An ageing</ins> population is a consequence <del><ArtOrDet>of</ArtOrDet></del><ins>of the</ins> increasing health level of <del><ArtOrDet>population</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the population</ins>. 
The concurrent result is <del><ArtOrDet>increasing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the increasing</ins> size of <del><ArtOrDet>population</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the population</ins>. 
When the <del><Wform>elders</Wform></del><ins>elderly</ins> live longer, the family size actually increases rather than decreases. 
In addition, the younger generation <del><V0>eager</V0></del><ins>is</ins> to start their own family <del><Prep>at</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><Npos>another</Npos></del><ins>their</ins> <del><Wci>place</Wci></del><ins>own place</ins> rather than staying together with family. 
This phenomenon increases the demand of <del><Rloc->land</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> property and subsequently affects <del><Wci>their</Wci></del><ins>both</ins> price and size together. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Increasing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>An increasing</ins> <del><Rloc->size</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> population also leads to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> problem in food supply. 
<del><Trans>The</Trans></del><ins>If the</ins> production of food is showing a lower growth rate <del><Wform>compare</Wform></del><ins>compared</ins> to <del><ArtOrDet>population's</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the population's</ins> growth <del><Ssub>rate which</Ssub></del><ins>rate, the country </ins> will end up with insufficient food in the future. 

Rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is also an achievement <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>governments</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the governments</ins>. 
People expect more on the ground of <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> current economy, life stability and <del><Wci>desire</Wci></del><ins>desire fulfillment</ins>. 
For <del><ArtOrDet>an</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> example, one <del><Vm>would like</Vm></del><ins>might have liked</ins> to have I-Phone 5 in the past but he or she <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> expect it to have more functions or operate <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>faster</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a faster</ins> speed after using it a while. 
Thus, the rising expectancies actually <del><SVA>reflect</SVA></del><ins>reflects</ins> the increasing stability and comfort of people's life and indirectly <del><Spar>reflecting</Spar></del><ins>reflects</ins> the ability of <del><ArtOrDet>government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the govenment</ins> to provide people <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> their current comforts, <del><Wform>economical</Wform></del><ins>economic</ins> <del><Wci>statues</Wci></del><ins>status</ins>, convenience and others. 

Rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is an <del><Mec>achievement</Mec></del><ins>achievement,</ins> but it poses more challenges to <del><ArtOrDet>government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the government</ins> and people. 
All have to work hard and cooperate to deal with these challenges <del><Trans>on</Trans></del><ins>as</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> way of meeting expectancies. 
Otherwise, the comfort level of life will be maintained or lowered <del><Prep>down </Prep></del><ins></ins><del><Trans>when</Trans></del><ins>as</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> time passes <del><Trans>or</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> people <del><Vm>should</Vm></del><ins>would have</ins> lower their <del><Wform>expectancies</Wform></del><ins>expectation</ins> of life.

From one perspective, it shows that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different <del><Mec>deceases</Mec></del><ins>diseases</ins>. 
From another perspective, there are more and more <del><Wform>elder</Wform></del><ins>elderly</ins> people but <del><Wci>less</Wci></del><ins>fewer</ins> younger <del><Srun>ones,</Srun></del><ins>ones;</ins> the increase in population age has <del><Vform>weaken</Vform></del><ins>weakened</ins> the labor force and so on. 
In my opinion, the increase in population age is more a challenge than an achievement. 

Firstly, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> population ageing can be definitely viewed as an improvement of human culture and technology<del><Prep>. 
</Prep></del><ins>. 
In</ins><del><Wform>Compare</Wform></del><ins>comparing</ins> the technology today and the past, we can see that a lot of <del><Mec>deceases</Mec></del><ins>diseases</ins> are <del><Srun>treatable, the</Srun></del><ins>treatable. 
The</ins> number of people <del><Trans>that</Trans></del><ins>who</ins> died because of <del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins><del><Mec>deceases</Mec></del><ins>diseases</ins> that <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> not treatable <del><Vt>decreases</Vt></del><ins>has decreased</ins>. 
The fast development of medicine and technological <del><Nn>product</Nn></del><ins>products</ins> <del><Vt>makes</Vt></del><ins>has made</ins> people's <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins> much healthier <del><Wform>compare</Wform></del><ins>compared</ins> to the past. 
Moreover, the <del><Wci>increased</Wci></del><ins>advanced</ins> technologies <del><Vt>help</Vt></del><ins>have helped</ins> people to overcome different natural disasters. 
People are able to <del><Mec>predicate</Mec></del><ins>predict</ins> some disasters like <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec><del><Nn>ea</Mec></del><ins>earthquakes</ins>rth quake</Nn></del><ins></ins> and <del><Rloc->do</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>prevention</Wform></del><ins>prevent</ins> <del><Others>beforehand</Others></del><ins>them beforehand</ins>. 

Although the increase in population <del><Nn>ages</Nn></del><ins>age</ins> shows that people have <del><Wci>increased</Wci></del><ins>advanced</ins> knowledge and technologies, it should be considered as a challenge more than an achievement. 
The technology is always improving and it never stops, and the lifespan of people <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> getting longer as well. 
Thus, we should not compare now with the past <del><Trans>but</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> we need to <del><Vform>worried</Vform></del><ins>worry</ins> about <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> future problems that <del><Vm>caused</Vm></del><ins>could be</ins> by this situation. 

The first challenge is the decreasing number of <del><Mec><del><Nn</Mec></del><ins>newborns</ins>>new born</Nn></del><ins></ins>. 
As <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> population ageing <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> <del><Wci>growing</Wci></del><ins>increasing</ins>, as people <del><V0>getting</V0></del><ins>are getting</ins> old, they need to be <del><Prep>cared</Prep></del><ins>cared for</ins> by others and are not able to contribute as <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>same</Wci></del><ins>much</ins> <del><Trans>as</Trans></del><ins>as when</ins> they were young. 
If the number of old people is too <del><Wci>much</Wci></del><ins>large</ins> and there <del><ArtOrDet>is </ArtOrDet></del><ins>is a</ins><del><Wci>lesser</Wci></del><ins>smaller</ins> number of younger people, it will affect the growth of the whole society as the young workers are <del><Wci>less</Wci></del><ins>fewer</ins><del><Trans>,</Trans></del><ins>, and</ins> the productivity and <del><Wform>technology</Wform></del><ins>technological</ins> improvements will be <del><Wci>less</Wci></del><ins>fewer</ins>. 
At the same <del><Mec>time</Mec></del><ins>time,</ins> more people are needed to take care of the old ones, which gives the younger generation extra <del><Nn>works</Nn></del><ins>work</ins>. 
The second challenge will be the shortage of natural resources. 
<del><WOinc>As we know that</WOinc></del><ins>We know that as</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>population</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the population</ins> of <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> continues <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Wform>growth</Wform></del><ins>grow</ins> year by year, we are using <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>non</Wci></del><ins>more non</ins>-recoverable natural <del><Smod>resources in everyday <del><Srun>life, </Srun></del><ins>l</Smod></del><ins>resources, such as oil, in everyday life. 
People's</ins>ife.</ins><del><Wci>for example, </Wci></del><ins>such as</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> oil, people's life and <del><Wform>technology</Wform></del><ins>technological</ins> improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil. 
However, <del><ArtOrDet>these</ArtOrDet></del><ins>this</ins> natural <del><Nn>resources</Nn></del><ins>resource</ins> <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> not renewable. 
We do not <del><Wci>consider much</Wci></del><ins>think enough</ins> <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> our offspring. 
Ever imagine <del><ArtOrDet>one</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> day that no natural resources are <del><Srun>left what</Srun></del><ins>left? What</ins> <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> be the life of our next <del><Mec>generation.</Mec></del><ins>generation?</ins> The increase in population <del><Ssub>means</Ssub></del><ins>means that</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>larger</Wci></del><ins>more</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> natural resources are needed and people have to think <del><Prep>out</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> some <del><Nn>idea</Nn></del><ins>ideas</ins> like to prevent using too <del><Wci>much</Wci></del><ins>many</ins> natural resources

In conclusion, the increase in population age shows both the human <del><Wform>technology</Wform></del><ins>technological</ins> achievement and <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> new challenges <del><ArtOrDet>like</ArtOrDet></del><ins>like a</ins> <del><Wci>lack</Wci></del><ins>smaller</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> young generation. 
We have to <del><Wci>consider</Wci></del><ins>think</ins> more about our future <del><Nn>generation</Nn></del><ins>generations</ins>, <del><Vform>aware</Vform></del><ins>be aware</ins> of the <del><Nn>problem</Nn></del><ins>problems</ins> that <del><Wci>over aging</Wci></del><ins>increased lifespan</ins> <del><Vt>brought</Vt></del><ins>has brought</ins> to us and come up with ideas to solve these challenges.

<del><ArtOrDet>An improvement</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Improvement</ins> in engineering and medical science had been valued since <del><Um>humanism arises</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
Studies have shown that the average life span <del><Mec>or</Mec></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> <del><V0>being</V0></del><ins>has been</ins> rising gradually over <del><ArtOrDet>years</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the years</ins>, in the sense that the <del><WOadv>improvement of global</WOadv></del><ins>global improvement of</ins> technology in medicine <del><Vt>helps</Vt></del><ins>has helped</ins> <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> to live longer and <del><Spar>enjoyed</Spar></del><ins>enjoy</ins> the world even more. 
In spite of <del><Pform>that</Pform></del><ins>this</ins>, people should <del><Vform>aware</Vform></del><ins>be aware</ins> that the power of science is not almighty, life will still go to <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> last page without <del><Um>revelation</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
Since not all <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> going to be a doctor, people <del><SVA>relies</SVA></del><ins>rely</ins> <del><Prep>the</Prep></del><ins>on the</ins> <del><Wci>skills of treatment</Wci></del><ins>treatment skills</ins> of doctors and hence, they start to ignore the maintenance of their own health. 

<del><Wci>There</Wci></del><ins>It</ins> is <del><Wci>needless</Wci></del><ins>impossible</ins> to doubt that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> medical technology has <del><Wci>enhanced</Wci></del><ins>improved</ins> day by day. 
In the past, when people <del><Vform>injured</Vform></del><ins>were injured</ins> or <del><Wci>fall</Wci></del><ins>became</ins> <del><Prep>into</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>sickness</Wform></del><ins>sick</ins>, there <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> no guarantee that the people <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> get <del><Wform>well</Wform></del><ins>good</ins> treatment and fully <del><Spar>recovered</Spar></del><ins>recover</ins><del><Srun>, therefore</Srun></del><ins>; therefore,</ins> people <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> easily die <del><Trans>by</Trans></del><ins>if</ins> infected <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> a <del><Wci>small</Wci></del><ins>minor</ins> disease. 
With the <del><Wci>grand</Wci></del><ins>advanced</ins> medical skill we <del><Vform>are having</Vform></del><ins>have</ins> nowadays, <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> <del><Vt>lived</Vt></del><ins>live</ins> longer and hence, <del><WOinc>a</WOinc></del><ins>there is a</ins> great <del><Wform>increasing</Wform></del><ins>increase</ins> in population. 
It would be great if life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> keep rising up day by day, but in reality, it does not seem to be so <del><Wci>easy</Wci></del><ins>ideal</ins>. 
Firstly, although <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> treatment is reliable, people would still need to have <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> awareness of their own health condition. 
There are millions of <del><Nn>doctor</Nn></del><ins>doctors</ins> all over the world, but there are billions of patients as well. 
Nowadays, the pressure from the head of a company towards <del><ArtOrDet>those</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> <del><Nn>employee</Nn></del><ins>employees</ins> <del><Vt>caused</Vt></del><ins>has caused</ins> <del><Ssub>that</Ssub></del><ins></ins> people <del><Rloc->has</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> to <del><Rloc->be</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> fully concentrate in their jobs and because of that, people <del><Vt>starts</Vt></del><ins>have started</ins> to ignore their health condition and <del><Spar>relies</Spar></del><ins>rely</ins> on treatment and <del><Nn>supplement</Nn></del><ins>supplements</ins>. 
Pressure can really cause sickness just like <del><Nn>virus</Nn></del><ins>viruses</ins> and germs and it is more like a chronic disease. 
It is like a key that <del><SVA>open</SVA></del><ins>opens</ins> up the gate of <del><ArtOrDet>human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the human</ins> body <del><Wform>defend</Wform></del><ins>defense</ins> system and <del><Spar>provide</Spar></del><ins>provides</ins> a cleared path for other <del><Nn>disease</Nn></del><ins>diseases</ins> to attack <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins>. 
Therefore, when the era <del><Vform>is improving</Vform></del><ins>improves</ins> itself, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> disease does <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins></ins> too. 
It is a big challenge to eliminate all the disease in the world and <del><Spar>keeping</Spar></del><ins>keep</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn><del><Mec</Nn></del><ins>lifespans</ins>>life span</Mec></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>to grow</Wform></del><ins>growing</ins> as people do <del><Vform>sick</Vform></del><ins>sicken</ins> every moment. 

Nevertheless, <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> still need an improvement. 
<del><Prep>By</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>comparing</Wform></del><ins>Compared</ins> to the past, it is a big step forward in <del><ArtOrDet>development</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the development</ins> of medical science.

It is really a great achievement in <del><ArtOrDet>enhancement</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the enhancement</ins> of technology which should be recorded in history. 

In conclusion, the reason why population ageing is increasing <del><Um>majority</Um></del><ins></ins> is due to the great improvement of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> global medical science. 
It is a challenge but also an achievement.

It may be a challenge but <del><ArtOrDet>also</ArtOrDet></del><ins>also a</ins> golden opportunity to educate <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> children properly to prevent <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> undesired outcomes.

However, among the under-developed countries, developing countries and developed countries, we found that there is <del><ArtOrDet>longest</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the longest</ins> life span in the developed <del><Mec>countries</Mec></del><ins>countries,</ins> <del><Vt>follows</Vt></del><ins>followed</ins> by the developing <del><Mec>countries</Mec></del><ins>countries,</ins> and the shortest life span <del><ArtOrDet>in</ArtOrDet></del><ins>in the</ins> under-developed countries. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The</ArtOrDet></del><ins>This</ins> observation means that the more developed the <del><Nn>countries</Nn></del><ins>country</ins>, the longer the life span <del><Npos>of</Npos></del><ins>its</ins> citizens. 
In the other words, it also can be said that it is an achievement to <del><Wci>obtain</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> an ageing population. 
<del><Pref>It</Pref></del><ins>People</ins> <del><Vm>is</Vm></del><ins>should be</ins> proud to have <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> ageing population <del><Trans>which</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> <del><Ssub>is</Ssub></del><ins>it is</ins> hard to achieve unless there are <del><Wci>advance</Wci></del><ins>advanced</ins> medical technology and higher living <del><Nn>standard</Nn></del><ins>standards</ins>.

This activity can be marked as the start of the first technology revolution.

This significantly raised people's average life expectancy. 
However, as the life expectancy of people rises, <del><ArtOrDet>population</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the population</ins> ageing problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenon. 
<del><Cit>Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65. 
Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually.</Cit></del><ins></ins> As the rise <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can be interpreted as a measure standard of the pace of technology development, it can be <del><Trans>seen</Trans></del><ins>seen as</ins> an achievement of human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins>. 
However, as <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> energy and resources <del><Vform>use</Vform></del><ins>are used</ins> up, more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce <del><Um>crowd on earth</Um></del><ins></ins> will aggravate the ageing problem, so the rise <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can also be seen as a challenge. 

As we are <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> <del><Mec>who</Mec></del><ins>, who</ins> are different from other animals, we have some basic rights like <del><ArtOrDet>right</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the right</ins> to privacy, <del><ArtOrDet>right</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the right</ins> to <del><Wform>live</Wform></del><ins>life</ins>, <del><ArtOrDet>right</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the right</ins> to have a family and so on. 
Among these basic rights, the most important one is the right to <del><Wform>live</Wform></del><ins>life</ins>. 
During the less developed times, due to disasters like <del><Mec>droughts ,floods</Mec></del><ins>droughts, floods</ins> or severe contagious <del><Nn>disease</Nn></del><ins>diseases</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>like</ArtOrDet></del><ins>like the</ins> <del><Mec>black</Mec></del><ins>Black</ins><del><Mec> <del><</Mec></del><ins></ins>Nn>deaths</Nn></del><ins>Death</ins>, people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they <del><Vt>do</Vt></del><ins>did</ins> not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time. 
However, as <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> technology <del><Vt>develops</Vt></del><ins>has developed</ins>, it <del><Vt>increased</Vt></del><ins>has increased</ins> people's mobility and productivity <del><Trans>so</Trans></del><ins>as well</ins> as life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins>. 
As we can use <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> resources with maximum efficiency, we can enjoy more and more <del><Um>life material </Um></del><ins></ins><del><Prep>than</Prep></del><ins>then at</ins> any time of human society. 
Even when <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> disaster comes, we can restore the order of our life in a relatively short time <del><Trans>than</Trans></del><ins>compared to</ins> before. 
For example, the tsunami <del><Ssub>in</Ssub></del><ins>that hit</ins> Tohoku of Japan in 2011 <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> "the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II" <del><Rloc->as CNN commented.</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> (CNN, 2011<del><Mec>)</Mec></del><ins>).</ins> However, only one year has <del><Trans>passed, most</Trans></del><ins>passed and most</ins> of the survivors have come back to their normal <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins> although with <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> sad <del><Nn>memory</Nn></del><ins>memories</ins>. 
This <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> not imaginable during less developed times. 
With the strong <del><Rloc->back</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> support of technology, the <del><Wform>rises</Wform></del><ins>rise</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can be seen as an achievement to the development of our human society. 

However, along with the increase of life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins>, ageing problems <del><Vt>becomes</Vt></del><ins>have become</ins> more and more severe. 
Two of the most important causes of <del><ArtOrDet>ageing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the ageing</ins> problem <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> increasing longevity and declining fertility. 
The increasing longevity is due to <del><ArtOrDet>fast</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the fast</ins> development of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society <del><Trans>so</Trans></del><ins>as well</ins> as <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>living pressure</Wci></del><ins>stress</ins>. 
The increasing pressure will lead to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> declining fertility. 
As people who are incapable of production become more and more, our society <del><Vm>follows</Vm></del><ins>could follow</ins> a downward trend. 
Moreover, as we use up more and more resources, what we have left may <del><V0>not</V0></del><ins>not be</ins> enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human <del><Nn>resource</Nn></del><ins>resources</ins> to <del><Rloc->do</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> research <del><Trans>of</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> <del><Spar>developing</Spar></del><ins>develop</ins> new technology. 
Therefore, the increase <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is also a great challenge. 

As <del><Pref>we</Pref></del><ins>I</ins> have mentioned above, the increase <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> life expectancy is an achievement as well as a challenge. 

In <del><ArtOrDet>modern</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the modernwith.

Nowadays, population aging <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>has</ins> <del><Vform>becoming</Vform></del><ins>become</ins> a <del><Mec>problem</Mec></del><ins>problem,</ins> especially in the developed countries. 
Now in Singapore, we can feel that there are more old people than young people if you go to Chinatown. 
Population ageing <del><Vform>also has</Vform></del><ins>has also</ins> brought us <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>question</Wci></del><ins>debate</ins> on <del><Rloc->whether we should raise</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins><del><Srun>, it</Srun></del><ins>. 
It</ins> is challenging <del><Trans>also</Trans></del><ins>but also</ins> <del><Vm>can get </Vm></del><ins></ins><del><ArtOrDet>some</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> achievement. 

In the first place, rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> could cause <del><Nn>resources</Nn></del><ins>resource</ins> <del><Nn>challenge</Nn></del><ins>challenges</ins>. 
In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, <del><Rloc->if people still increase the humans' life, but for these small developed regions,</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> the resources are very <del><Mec>limited</Mec></del><ins>limited,</ins> especially land. 
Because the land is limited, <del><Trans>so</Trans></del><ins></ins> the average land for one person is very small already. 
Some years, there is a report on Hong Kong <del><Npos>citizens</Npos></del><ins>citizens'</ins> living situation, in a small room there are eight <del><Srun>people, they</Srun></del><ins>people. 
They</ins> cannot do anything in the <del><Trans>room, only can</Trans></del><ins>room except sleep</ins> sleep and the air in the room is very bad. 
So rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> will make the world population <del><Srun>larger, more</Srun></del><ins>larger and more</ins> people <del><Vm>shall</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> <del><V0>the</V0></del><ins>share the</ins> limited resources. 
In <del><Wform>economic</Wform></del><ins>economics</ins>, we can use GDP to explain the <del><Srun>challenge, if</Srun></del><ins>challenge. 
If</ins> GDP is low, it shows that most of <del><ArtOrDet>people</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the people</ins> are living <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> a hard <del><Srun>life,</Srun></del><ins>life.</ins> <del><Wci>life <del><M</Wci></del><ins>Quality of life</ins>ec>quality</Mec></del><ins></ins> is bad, then it will cause <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> terrible <del><Wform>society</Wform></del><ins>social</ins> <del><Nn>problem</Nn></del><ins>problems</ins><del><Srun>, at</Srun></del><ins> and at</ins> last, it will <del><Wci>happen</Wci></del><ins>cause</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>society</Wform></del><ins>social</ins> disturbance. 
The reason why it will happen is because people have violated <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> natural regulation. 

On the other hand, rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> could bring some achievements. 
People's <del><Wci>life quality</Wci></del><ins>quality of life</ins> has been better <del><Srun>now, in</Srun></del><ins>now. 
In</ins> order to continue improving, people have begun to consider how to <del><Wci>raise</Wci></del><ins>improve</ins> their life. 
Because <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> life and health are most significant, people have their own reasons to hope <del><Wci>living</Wci></del><ins>to live</ins> longer. 
<del><Prep>On</Prep></del><ins>In</ins> medicine, people have done a lot of <del><Nn>researches</Nn></del><ins>research</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> life science. 
Also people <del><Vt>begin</Vt></del><ins>have begun</ins> to realize the importance of the <del><Trans>environment,</Trans></del><ins>environment and</ins> <del><Wci>how</Wci></del><ins>the need</ins> to protect people from <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> harmful air. 
So according to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> humanism, people should make <del><ArtOrDet>contribution</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a contribution</ins> to <del><Wci>rising</Wci></del><ins>improving</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>humans</Wform></del><ins>human</ins> <del><Srun>life,</Srun></del><ins>life.</ins> <del><Trans><del><M</Trans></del><ins>Therefore,</ins>ec>because</Mec></del><ins></ins> people should consider <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> feelings <del><Trans>if</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> one day when <del><Pref>you</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>will be</ins> becoming older and <del><Srun>older, so</Srun></del><ins>older. 
So,</ins> respecting life should be considered carefully. 

In addition, now there <del><Wci>appears</Wci></del><ins>is</ins> a contradiction <del><Prep>if</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins><del><Srun>, it</Srun></del><ins>; it</ins> will <del><Prep>lead</Prep></del><ins>lead to</ins> a <del><Nn>resources</Nn></del><ins>resource</ins> problem. 
However, based on <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> humanism, humans are different from the <del><Srun>animals, people</Srun></del><ins>animals. 
People</ins> should respect <del><Wci>every</Wci></del><ins>all</ins> life. 
In my opinion, I think we should study balance <del><Wci>it</Wci></del><ins>as</ins> <del><Srun>well,</Srun></del><ins>well.</ins> <del><Wci>one</Wci></del><ins>On one</ins> <del><Mec>side</Mec></del><ins>side,</ins> we should continue to make efforts to <del><Wci>raise</Wci></del><ins>improve</ins> the <del><Wform>humans</Wform></del><ins>human</ins> <del><Srun>life,</Srun></del><ins>life.</ins> <del><Wci>one</Wci></del><ins>On the other</ins> side, we should consider using asking some sick old men whether <del><Rloc->if</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> they want to take euthanasia. 
<del><Prep>To</Prep></del><ins>In</ins> summary, we <del><Vm>respect</Vm></del><ins>should respect</ins> <del><Wci>every</Wci></del><ins>all</ins> <del><Trans>life,</Trans></del><ins>life and</ins> also help people to live longer. 

In conclusion, <del><Rloc->what I have mentioned above,</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> although <del><ArtOrDet>global</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the global</ins> aging issue has become more serious <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><Wform>humans</Wform></del><ins>human</ins> development, <del><Um>if we can balance and understand why we live.</Um></del><ins></ins> <del><Um>Then try to invent new energy and legitimately <del><ArtOrDet>control</ArtOrDet></del><ins>control the</ins> population birth rate, then developing <del><ArtOrDet>the</A</Um></del><ins></ins>rtOrDet></del><ins></ins> medical treatment and paying enough attention, we have reasons to trust, population aging will not be <del><ArtOrDet>problem</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a problem</ins> at all. 

Population ageing: A more and more attention-getting topic 
Nowadays, population aging has become a more global phenomenon. 
Subsequently, a lot of problems regarding to it are arising. 

<del><Prep>Due</Prep></del><ins>the modernwith.

As our society develops, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> people have a much higher living standard, which will reduce the chance of getting disease. 
Besides, <del><Prep>as</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> the development of the technology, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> medical therapy <del><Vt>also has</Vt></del><ins>has also had</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> tremendous progress. 
Many diseases which <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> incurable in the past can be cured now. 
Therefore, the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive. 
Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of <del><Wform>died</Wform></del><ins>dead</ins> people annually. 
On the other hand, the birth rate in many countries keeps <del><Srun>decreasing, </Srun></del><ins>decreasing;</ins><del><Wci>whose</Wci></del><ins>each</ins> figure is the lowest record <del><Wform>comparing</Wform></del><ins>compared</ins> to <del><ArtOrDet>previous</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the previous</ins> figure. 
Maybe, it is because <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> modern society <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>has</ins> become more and more <del><Srun>competitive,</Srun></del><ins>competitive;</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> parents are paying much attention and importance to their <del><Nn>career</Nn></del><ins>careers</ins>. 
They do not want to bother to spend so much time in raising and nurturing children. 
Maybe <del><Wtone>that's</Wtone></del><ins>that is</ins> one reason for the <del><Wci>reducing</Wci></del><ins>decrease</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the birth rate. 

The fact is that the <del><Cit>current average life span is over 65 and the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually.</Cit></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>This</ArtOrDet></del><ins>A</ins> survey evidently shows that big achievement has been made in the medical area and people's living standard has <del><Vform>been</Vform></del><ins></ins> improved. 
It also indicates that the economy has <del><Vform>been</Vform></del><ins></ins> dramatically grown. 
Yet, do not be confused by this superficial amount and achievement. 
The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky. 

First, if the older people increase, there will <del><ArtOrDet>be</ArtOrDet></del><ins>be a</ins> <del><Wci>fewer </Wci></del><ins>smaller</ins><del><Nn>workforces</Nn></del><ins>workforce</ins> that can support <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
However, <del><ArtOrDet>ageing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an ageing</ins> population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure. 
The most important part is health care and old-age <del><Nn>pension</Nn></del><ins>pensions</ins>. 
As elderly people, they need more money for health care than <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Others>younger</Others></del><ins>younger people</ins>. 
Government <del><Vm>should</Vm></del><ins>will</ins> also <del><Wci>make</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> a bigger amount of pension expenditure. 

Secondly, for <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> older people, more facilities and service for them <del><Vm>should</Vm></del><ins>will need to</ins> be provided. 
So more manpower will be employed, which <del><Mec>deduces</Mec></del><ins>reduces</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> labour in other <del><Nn>area</Nn></del><ins>areas</ins>. 
Of course, more money will be spent. 
To pay this extra money, government will <del><Wci>exert</Wci></del><ins>place</ins> higher <del><Wform>taxed</Wform></del><ins>taxes</ins> on <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> other people. 

Thirdly, compared to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> young people, the security of the elderly is more <del><Wci>notable</Wci></del><ins>necessary</ins>. 
Elderly people's ability to move and act is much lower. 
They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures. 
Therefore, some <del><Um>measurement</Um></del><ins></ins> and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people. 

To conclude, the population ageing phenomenon indeed shows our big achievement <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><Wform>economy</Wform></del><ins>economics</ins>, medical skills and living standard. 
Nonetheless, the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered.

It is natural that rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is regarded as an achievement. 
The goal of every species of living things is reproducing to increase the quantity of <del><Npos>this</Npos></del><ins>their</ins> species. 
Humankind is not an exception. 
People with rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> ensure <del><ArtOrDet>large</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a large</ins> population and <del><Wci>large species</Wci></del><ins>more variation</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins>. 
It is more secure for us because <del><Um>in potential sense we think</Um></del><ins></ins> with longer life expectancy it is harder for people to die out. 
Rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is also <del><ArtOrDet>an</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> evidence of progress <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> modern medical technology. 
For ancient <del><Mec>people</Mec></del><ins>people,</ins> it <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> miraculous to achieve 70 years old, but now it is <del><Wci>general</Wci></del><ins>normal</ins>. 
Rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can bring us <del><ArtOrDet>more</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a more</ins> skilled <del><Mec>work force</Mec></del><ins>workforce</ins> because we can delay the retirement time to extend <del><ArtOrDet>working</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the working</ins> <del><Wci>time</Wci></del><ins>years</ins> for each person. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Longer</ArtOrDet></del><ins>A longer</ins> working period means <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> old <del><Wform>person</Wform></del><ins>people</ins> who <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> more skilled <del><SVA>does</SVA></del><ins>do</ins> not need to retire and <del><WOinc>no <del><Wci>fres</WOinc></del><ins>inexperienced workers will not</ins>h </Wci></del><ins></ins><del><Wci>men</Wci></del><ins></ins> will <del><Wci>take</Wci></del><ins>need to take</ins> over. 
<del><Mec>Thus</Mec></del><ins>Thus,</ins> it is more efficient to keep more skilled people for long time rather than training <del><Wci>fresh men</Wci></del><ins>inexperienced workers</ins>. 

Rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can be a challenge. 
There are two possibilities. 
<del><ArtOrDet>On</ArtOrDet></del><ins>On the</ins> one hand, if there are <del><Wci>less</Wci></del><ins>fewer</ins> young people and more old people<del><ArtOrDet>, </ArtOrDet></del><ins>, a</ins><del><Wci>lacking</Wci></del><ins>smaller</ins> <del><Mec>work force</Mec></del><ins>workforce</ins> problem will arise. 
On the other hand, if there are enough young people, then young people with rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> will cause <del><ArtOrDet>larger</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a larger</ins> population. 

<del><Trans>We talk about the first possibility. 
If</Trans></del><ins>First, if</ins> there are <del><Wci>less</Wci></del><ins>fewer</ins> young people and more old people, as in both Singapore and China, <del><ArtOrDet>when</ArtOrDet></del><ins>when the</ins> elderly retire, there <del><Vt>are not</Vt></del><ins>will not be</ins> enough young people who can <del><Wci>make up</Wci></del><ins>fill</ins> <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins></ins> the new available positions. 
<del><Mec>Thus</Mec></del><ins>Thus,</ins> there will be <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>lacking</Wci></del><ins>too few</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>in</ArtOrDet></del><ins>in the</ins> labor force, which will <del><Prep>lead</Prep></del><ins>lead to</ins> a decreasing <del><Wci>speed</Wci></del><ins>rate</ins> of development of the country. 
Many factories <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be deserted and many companies <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> go <del><Wform>bankruptcy</Wform></del><ins>bankrupt</ins>, and thus people's life condition will definitely get worse. 
The past 30-year rapid development of China is connected with <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> large population, but due to the "only child" policy, we <del><Vm>have</Vm></del><ins>will have</ins> no benefits from <del><ArtOrDet>large</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a large</ins> population in the future. 
With <del><ArtOrDet>low</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a low</ins> birth rate, Singapore is bringing in foreigners to maintain the population to maintain the efficiency and development of the country. 

If there are more young people, then there <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> be even more elderly with rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> in the future <del><Rloc->definitely</Rloc-></del><ins></ins><del><Trans>.</Trans></del><ins>. 
If</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>Population</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The population</ins> is large while <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> resources are limited, <del><Ssub>which</Ssub></del><ins></ins> <del><WOinc>will incur many problems</WOinc></del><ins>many problems will incur</ins> such as environmental problems and inequality among people. 
Expansion of population cannot continue like that because <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> resources are limited, and we will end <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>up</ins> dying out after using up all resources. 

To sum up, with rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins>, there <del><SVA>exist</SVA></del><ins>exists</ins> both achievement and challenge. 
It is <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> progress of human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins> that we control the world and maintain our population with longer life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins>, but it also <del><Wci>has</Wci></del><ins>is</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>potential</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a potential</ins> crisis for <del><Trans>either</Trans></del><ins>both</ins> <del><Nn>nation</Nn></del><ins>nations</ins> or <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins>. 
We can either step back to maintain the population with some method, or step forward to search for more resources in outer space. 

Population ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively in advanced <del><Mec>civilizations.It</Mec></del><ins>the modernwith.

It</ins> requires at least three conditions to happen: <del><ArtOrDet>advanced</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an advanced</ins> health care system, reduced hazards from the environment and <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> ubiquitous good will for senior citizens. 
However, when it happens, it is hard to deny that it brings problems such as increased expenses and <del><ArtOrDet>reduced</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a reduced</ins> <del><Wform>labors</Wform></del><ins>labor</ins> <del><Others><d</Others></del><ins>force for</ins>el><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 

If a country can bear <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> ageing population, it is a thing that the country can be proud of. 
In the first place, it must have <del><Wci>grasped</Wci></del><ins>achieved</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>advanced</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an advanced</ins> health care system. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Ageing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The ageing</ins> problem is in essence a problem of worsening bodies. 
With increasing age, people become more prone to disease and injury, and <del><Spar>more</Spar></del><ins>have more</ins> <del><Wform>difficult</Wform></del><ins>difficulty</ins> <del><Wform>to recover</Wform></del><ins>recovering</ins>. 
Without <del><ArtOrDet>advanced</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an advanced</ins> health care system, aged people have <del><ArtOrDet>higher</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a higher</ins> rate of death. 
In fact, this was the major limitation of people's average life span in the past. 
With advanced medical technology, not only <del><WOinc>many diseases can</WOinc></del><ins>can many diseases</ins> be cured, but also people know how to keep themselves healthy. 

If <del><ArtOrDet>developed</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a developed</ins> health care system is increasing the positive side, it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side, which <del><Vform>including</Vform></del><ins>includes</ins> reducing <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> hazards <del><Prep>from</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the environment. 
Health <del><Wform>caring</Wform></del><ins>care</ins> by far <del><Vt>has been</Vt></del><ins>is</ins> <del><Others>expensive</Others></del><ins>the most expensive</ins> to carry out. 
If the environment is too dangerous to live in, there would <del><WOinc>be not</WOinc></del><ins>not be</ins> sufficient medical resources for usage. 
Such environmental hazards come from various aspects. 
A major source of the hazards is <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> pollution. 
A place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good <del><Mec>habbitat</Mec></del><ins>habitat</ins> and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents, among which aged people and children will be harmed <del><ArtOrDet>most</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the most</ins>. 
Only if the city is safe and comfortable can people live a longer and happier life. 

If the above two aspects are described as the <del><Nn>hardwares</Nn></del><ins>hardware</ins> of the system, they do require <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> software to function, which is <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> ubiquitous good will for senior citizens. 
When people become old, most of them join the weak group of citizens who have to <del><Rloc->live by</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>receiving</Wform></del><ins>receive</ins> care from other people. 
If <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment, but <del><SVA>do</SVA></del><ins>does</ins> not grant <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> access to them <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> its senior citizens, it just does not help. 
And if people in society do not want to care for their elderly, nothing will be done for them. 
Only when there is <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> ubiquitous good will for senior citizens can <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> aged people live well, and that is a thing to be proud of. 

With the glory, there <del><SVA>comes</SVA></del><ins>come</ins> problems. 
To take care of old people, facillities such as nursing homes <del><Vm>should</Vm></del><ins>need to</ins> be built, which add on to the <del><Nn>expense</Nn></del><ins>expenses</ins> of society. 
An even larger share of the old people expense lies in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> health care. 
In addition, old people are weakened in many aspects, thus they are usually not considered as <del><Wci>labors</Wci></del><ins>workers</ins>. 
When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population, the <del><Wci>labor</Wci></del><ins>workers</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> considered to become <del><Wci>less</Wci></del><ins>fewer</ins> and each <del><Wci>labor</Wci></del><ins>worker</ins> <del><SVA>need</SVA></del><ins>needs</ins> to pay more <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> the welfare of the old people. 

In summary, the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> increase <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins><del><Wci>load</Wci></del><ins>expenses</ins> and the <del><Wform>advance</Wform></del><ins>advancement</ins> of society, <del><Mec>including</Mec></del><ins>including,</ins> at <del><Mec>least</Mec></del><ins>least,</ins> <del><Rloc->advaced</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>advanced</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an advanced</ins> health care system, reduced hazards <del><Prep>from</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the environment and <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> ubiquitous good will for senior citizens, at the same time.

For people, this is an achievement, but for nature, it changes its <del><Nn>rule</Nn></del><ins>rules</ins> and <del><Nn>cycle</Nn></del><ins>cycles</ins>, which is a big challenge faced by human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins>. 

If anyone has ever read any fiction or <del><Wform>storied</Wform></del><ins>stories</ins> written before the 18th century, it is very hard to find any character in those stories <del><Ssub>lived</Ssub></del><ins>who lived</ins> longer than 80 years old. 
They may die <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> hunger, die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never <del><Mec>waked</Mec></del><ins>woke</ins> again. 
In China, there is a famous saying that there are <del><Ssub>things</Ssub></del><ins>things that</ins> should be celebrated, one is red and one is white. 
Here, red <del><Nn>thing</Nn></del><ins>things</ins> <del><SVA>means</SVA></del><ins>mean</ins> marriage and white means someone passing away. 
The first time <del><Rloc->when</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> I read this saying I <del><Vt>am</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past, it <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old, you will suffer a lot from illness or <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> sadness for your <del><Wform>young</Wform></del><ins>younger</ins> relatives passing away, so people think it is worth celebrating since <del><Pref>they</Pref></del><ins>the old person</ins> will not suffer any longer. 
It is very hard to understand such a feeling <del><Trans>as</Trans></del><ins>that</ins> people felt in the past. 
Now, technology and science <del><Vt>develops</Vt></del><ins>has developed</ins> at an unbelievably fast pace. 
There is lots of illness that <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> thought incurable in the <del><Spar>past</Spar></del><ins>past that</ins> <del><Vt>vanished</Vt></del><ins>has vanished</ins> in the world. 
Even <del><Trans>though</Trans></del><ins></ins> people with cancer, which is still hard to cure, now have more <del><Nn>chance</Nn></del><ins>chances</ins> to survive and have a longer time to live. 
Besides illness, the improvement of technology generates more food both in quantity and in quality. 
<del><Prep>In</Prep></del><ins>At</ins> the same time, it also frees a great amount of labor. 
Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-<del><Wci>level</Wci></del><ins>quality</ins> food and even pursuing <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> tasty and luxury <del><Pref>one</Pref></del><ins>food</ins>. 
It is a break-through <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> technology and science, and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom. 

Making use of our smart brain to improve our quality of life and give us more time to enjoy the life, it sounds <del><Rloc->like</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> perfect, but we must face <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> reality -- there is no Utopia. 
Before people find another planet to <del><Prep>live</Prep></del><ins>live on</ins>, the earth is the only habitat for us, <del><V0>and</V0></del><ins>and has</ins> <del><Trans>hence</Trans></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>limit</Wform></del><ins>limited</ins> <del><Wci>of its</Wci></del><ins></ins> capacity to support <del><Wform>livings</Wform></del><ins>life</ins><del><Srun>, it</Srun></del><ins>.

People's <del><Wci><del><WO</Wci></del><ins></ins>adv>lifetime rising</WOadv></del><ins>rising lifespan</ins> means that the time of the cycle of generation rises. 
Furthermore, thanks to the development of technology, that the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is <del><Mec>decreasing</Mec></del><ins>decreasing,</ins> <del><Vform><del><WOinc</Vform></del><ins></ins>>accelerates population aging</WOinc></del><ins>population ageing is accelerating</ins> and increasing. 
To our disappointment, now the technology is not so advanced that it can <del><Wci>generate</Wci></del><ins>support</ins> all human beings <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> <del><Rloc->using</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> limited resources. 
Moreover, the global population aging means that the total amount and quality of labor is decreasing. 
Before robots can fully replace labor, the <del><Wform>decreasing</Wform></del><ins>decrease</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> generating power <del><SVA>indicate</SVA></del><ins>indicates</ins> less creativity and <del><Wci>less</Wci></del><ins>fewer</ins> goods available for us to use. 
It is <del><Rloc->such</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> a challenge that human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins> cannot avoid and must solve. 
The only way is to develop technology but the chance to develop is based on people's wisdom and creativity, which is decreasing due to population aging. 

The world is always fair to us. 
While we are celebrating <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>break-through</Nn></del><ins>break-throughs</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> our way to Utopia, we are <del><Rloc->suffering</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> facing <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> a new challenge. 
We cannot give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way <del><Prep>die</Prep></del><ins>to die</ins> and <del><Vform>reborn</Vform></del><ins>be reborn</ins>. 
Therefore, the only way available for us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development <del><Trans>so</Trans></del><ins>in order</ins> to increase the capacity of our planet. 

<del><Trans>As</Trans></del><ins>the modernwith.

It</ins> <del><Mec>with</Mec></del><ins>With</ins> the world is becoming more and more advanced, people are leading a more and more comfortable life. 
Moreover, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> <del><SVA>have</SVA></del><ins>has</ins> also been <del><Wci>raised</Wci></del><ins>rising</ins> due to the <del><Wform>developing</Wform></del><ins>development</ins> of the economy. 
However, while we are enjoying the fruits <del><Prep>carried be</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> the development of the economy, we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing. 
There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious <del><Trans>which</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> <del><SVA>have</SVA></del><ins>has</ins> gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>source</Wci></del><ins>resource</ins> allocation. 
Therefore, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can be considered both a challenge and an achievement. 

On one side, we cannot deny that <del><WOinc>it is a great achievement with <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet</WOinc></del><ins>rising life expectancy is a great achievement</ins>></del><ins></ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins>. 
The reason why <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> have <del><Wci>aroused</Wci></del><ins>risen</ins> is that we are becoming more and more clever due to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> evolution, and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned. 
Since <del><Ssub>that</Ssub></del><ins></ins> we <del><Wci>get</Wci></del><ins>are</ins> richer, we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life. 
Therefore, because of the great efforts we have made, we have been living a better life. 
And that is what we are striving for. 
So <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can be regarded as <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> proof of what we have <del><Wci>made</Wci></del><ins>done</ins> to <del><Um>combat</Um></del><ins></ins> for ourselves. 

On the other side, we have to say that <del><ArtOrDet>obvious</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the obvious</ins> problems that we are facing are also caused by <del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins><del><Wform>rise</Wform></del><ins>rising</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> life expectancy. 
Since <del><Ssub>that</Ssub></del><ins></ins> we have <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> better living circumstances and higher <del><Wci>living quality</Wci></del><ins>quality of life</ins>, we are <del><Wci>leading</Wci></del><ins>enjoying</ins> a longer life. 
This seems to be <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> gratifying progress at the first sight. 
However, during the process of <del><Rloc->making</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>development</Wform></del><ins>developing</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> our life, we <del><Vt>decide</Vt></del><ins>decided</ins> to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that <del><Um>the shortage of source allocation</Um></del><ins></ins> can also be slowed down. 
This also works and we have <del><Rloc->also</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> seen the effect. 
Then there comes a problem. 
Because <del><Ssub>that</Ssub></del><ins></ins> the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced, the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased. 
So the population is getting more and more aged. 
But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> youth. 
That is to say, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> population aging has aggravated the burden of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
Then we can see that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face. 

Taken together, we should say that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>rise</Wform></del><ins>rising</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is <del><Mec>two sided</Mec></del><ins>two-sided</ins>. 
It <del><Vform>has</Vform></del><ins>has been</ins> shown that we are leading a better life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population aging. 
However, the achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenges.

Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that overall quality of life is increasing in both developed and developing countries. 
However, it is also a challenge because it strains both society and the environment.

This is the result of <del><ArtOrDet>better</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a better</ins> quality of life; which is basically sufficient food and clean water, better <del><Nn>sanitations</Nn></del><ins>sanitation</ins> and advanced <del><Mec>health-care</Mec></del><ins>healthcare</ins>. 
With sufficient food, children will develop properly into adults. 
Better <del><Nn>sanitations</Nn></del><ins>sanitation</ins> will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses. 
<del><Wform>Advance</Wform></del><ins>Advanced</ins> healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> individual's existence on earth. 
Examples of how <del><Wform>advance</Wform></del><ins>advanced</ins> <del><Mec>health</Mec></del><ins>healthcare</ins> in the city has raised life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> are such as antibiotics, the cure of poliomyelitis, and better and cleaner surgical procedures. 
All of these are human achievements in their own <del><Nn>rights</Nn></del><ins>right</ins> that have resulted in rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins>, and hence they also <del><SVA>illustrates</SVA></del><ins>illustrate</ins> why <del><Others>rising </Others></del><ins>rising life</ins><del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can be considered an achievement. 

It is remarkable that <del><ArtOrDet>population</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the population</ins> aged 60 and over is increasing at 2% to 3% annually in developing countries as well. 
It is highly plausible that the <del><Wci>results</Wci></del><ins>reasons</ins> for <del><ArtOrDet>increase</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the increase</ins> are the same as the developed countries. 
If that is true, it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries, albeit slowly. 
Fewer famines, better <del><Nn>sanitations</Nn></del><ins>sanitation</ins> and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century's greatest achievement as a global society. 

However, an aging population is taxing on a country. 
Although life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> may increase significantly, the <del><Npos>population</Npos></del><ins>population's</ins> overall productivity may not increase linearly. 
<del><Pref>They</Pref></del><ins>The elderly</ins> will end up putting a burden on the society that they have been <del><Prep>contributing</Prep></del><ins>contributing to</ins> their whole working career. 
With falling birth rates, there will be fewer working adults in society to distribute the workload. 
In addition, an aging population will require more healthcare and treatment because one's constitution weakens as one ages. 
The challenge is how many lives can the society and community afford to sustain; and it will only become increasingly difficult to handle. 

<del><Others>Rising </Others></del><ins>Rising life</ins><del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy. 
More food, clean water, better sanitation, and healthcare consume large quantities of energy. 
An example is the modern method of intense farming. 
Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticides, and to harvest and transport the food <del><Wform>produces</Wform></del><ins>produced</ins> around the globe. 
If the current quality of life <del><Vm>has to be</Vm></del><ins>is</ins> sustained or <del><Vform>increase</Vform></del><ins>increased</ins> in order to keep increasing <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins>, it will <del><Vform>be</Vform></del><ins></ins> continue to have a huge impact on the environment. 
The challenge will be <del><Vform>increase</Vform></del><ins>increasing</ins> the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable. 

<del><ArtOrDet>The rising</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Rising</ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is the by-product of rising quality of life<del><Mec>;</Mec></del><ins>,</ins> bringing along its glory and its dirty little secrets. 

At the present time, people are more concerned about their health.

<del><ArtOrDet>The rising</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Rising</ins> life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings. 
However, as there are only limited space and <del><Nn>resource</Nn></del><ins>resources</ins> on earth, rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> people worldwide. 

Rising life expectancy is a <del><Wform>technology</Wform></del><ins>technological</ins> achievement. 
Back <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> ancient <del><Mec>days,</Mec></del><ins>days</ins> when human beings <del><Wform>firstly</Wform></del><ins>first</ins> appeared on the earth, the average life expectancy <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> <del><Rloc->only</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> less than 20. 
The reasons <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions, the lack of food, the lack of hygiene knowledge, and also very importantly, the lack of medicine. 
With the development of <del><Mec>society,</Mec></del><ins>society</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>over</ins> the past thousands of years, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> technology <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>has been</ins> progressing and <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> concern for health is <del><Wform>arising</Wform></del><ins>rising</ins>, so that higher life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> achieved. 
With more advanced technology in medicine <del><Rloc->area</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>, more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided. 
Since people get higher education today, increasing amounts of people <del><Vt>switch</Vt></del><ins>have switched</ins> from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Such a</ins> situation is <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> major progress from <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> ancient <del><Nn>time</Nn></del><ins>times</ins> and also a big achievement by all human beings. 

However, since <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> space and <del><Nn>resource</Nn></del><ins>resources</ins> on earth <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> very limited, higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable. 
Since there are more people on the earth, more space is needed for people to live in, so <del><Trans>that</Trans></del><ins></ins> some farming land might be turned into buildings to accommodate more people. 
However, the need for food is also increasing, so <del><Trans>that</Trans></del><ins></ins> the competition might become even more frightening. 
<del><Wtone>What's</Wtone></del><ins>Even</ins> worse, since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have, violence might take place more frequently. 
<del><Wform>Many</Wform></del><ins>Much</ins> <del><Ssub>violence</Ssub></del><ins>violence that</ins> <del><Vt>happened</Vt></del><ins>has happened</ins> in Middle East is just due to the fight for food and water <del><Nn>resource</Nn></del><ins>resources</ins>. 
With more people living on the earth, pollution might become even serious, and as a result of pollution, the supply of food and water will decrease, so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve. 

In <del><Wci>a word</Wci></del><ins>summary</ins>, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> rising <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge for <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>whole</Wci></del><ins>all</ins> human beings. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The advanced</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Advanced</ins> technology has helped us to live longer, but the limited <del><Nn>resource</Nn></del><ins>resources</ins> on earth is also a big challenge. 
We should do our best to cooperate with each other and live on the same earth in harmony.

Itstatisticallya balanced</ins> modern society, people <del><SVA>lives</SVA></del><ins>live</ins> longer. 
Statistics <del><SVA>shows</SVA></del><ins>show</ins> that worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 66.57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009. 
In <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> developed countries like Japan and Switzerland, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> life expectancy can be <del><Rloc->as high as</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> more than 80. 
Normally, people will regard <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> extended life <del><Wform>expectation</Wform></del><ins>expectancy</ins> as an achievement, and usually use such data as a measure of the development of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> countries. 
However, as the population is ageing, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of <del><Wform>workforce</Wform></del><ins>workers</ins> <del><Vform>are also <del><Wc</Vform></del><ins>also exist</ins>i>realized</Wci></del><ins></ins>. 
In a nut shell, rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can be considered both an achievement and a challenge. 

Indeed, thanks to improved living <del><Nn>standard</Nn></del><ins>standards</ins> and medical care, countless people's lives <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>have been</ins> extended. 
No doubt life is the most precious treasure of human beings. 
Without life, we have nothing. 
In the long history of the evolution, we are always struggling for life against <del><Mec>staving</Mec></del><ins>starving</ins> and illness. 
In last two centuries, we <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> have made the greatest achievement in developing our society. 
We <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>have</ins> modernized and we have gained improved living <del><Nn>standard</Nn></del><ins>standards</ins> and medical care. 
We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness. 
In <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> ancient times, <del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins><del><Wci>residents</Wci></del><ins>people</ins> may only live for 30 years; but now, the life expectancy can <del><Prep>be</Prep></del><ins>be into</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>80s</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the 80s</ins> in many countries. 
With a doubled life time, humans can <del><ArtOrDet>have </ArtOrDet></del><ins>have a</ins><del><Mec>change</Mec></del><ins>chance</ins> to explore the real meaning of life. 
There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man's life. 
Hence, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> no doubt can be considered as a great achievement. 

On the other hand, the aging <del><ArtOrDet>of </ArtOrDet></del><ins>of the</ins><del><Mec>Population</Mec></del><ins>population</ins> can also be a challenge to the society. 
When people grow old, they will be weak and get sick easily. 
<del><Pform>That</Pform></del><ins>This</ins> is <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> natural law which nobody can violate. 
Hence, when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point, the challenge to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society cannot be <del><Wform>neglect</Wform></del><ins>neglected</ins> anymore. 
First, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> medical <del><Nn>cost</Nn></del><ins>costs</ins> will rise greatly. 
If the individual or family is to pay the bill, they can be bankrupted because of illness. 
If the medical cost is covered by the government budget, the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government. 
Second, the shortage of <del><Wform>workforce</Wform></del><ins>workers</ins> can also endanger the development of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
<del><Npos>Japan</Npos></del><ins>Japanese</ins> society is now facing <del><ArtOrDet>severe</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a severe</ins> ageing problem, and the path of development is seriously slowed. 
There has been a report <del><Wform>estimated</Wform></del><ins>estimating</ins> that <del><Prep>at</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> the year 2060, only half of the population in Japan <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>will be</ins> <del><Wci>suitable</Wci></del><ins>able</ins> to work. 
The same situation is happening around the world. 
Obviously, rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> should also be considered as a serious challenge. 

To conclude, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> must be considered both an achievement and a challenge. 
To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society, but also a fulfillment of our original dream. 
At the same time, we also need to consider the negative effects brought by the ageing population, and then find proper measures to counter the challenges.

It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems, but in the same time, it is also a symbol of improvement. 
Therefore, population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Following</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The following</ins><del><Wci> <de</Wci></del><ins></ins>l><Others>are</Others></del><ins>paragraphs have</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> more specific explanations. 

<del><ArtOrDet>The rising</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Rising</ins> average life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> can surely cause some problems. 
Firstly, the aging population is generally of low productivity. 
It is a natural rule that when people grow older, their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower, so they will contribute less to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
In addition, elderly people are using <del><ArtOrDet>same</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the same</ins> or even more <del><Rloc->amount of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> social <del><Nn>resource</Nn></del><ins>resources</ins>, as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status. 
Furthermore, to <del><Wci>make livings,</Wci></del><ins>support themselves</ins> many senior citizens go back to work <del><Rloc->field</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
It will also induce many problems. 
For example, these senior citizens may do the work less <del><Wform>efficient</Wform></del><ins>efficiently</ins> <del><Trans>and</Trans></del><ins></ins> which will lead to a <del><Wform>low</Wform></del><ins>lower</ins> effective output. 
To make him or her more competitive so <del><Others>that</Others></del><ins>that the elderly person</ins> <del><V0>not</V0></del><ins>is not</ins> <del><Vform>be </Vform></del><ins></ins><del><Vform>beat</Vform></del><ins>beaten</ins> by the younger, old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus. 
This may lead to the younger's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower <del><Wci>living standard</Wci></del><ins>standard of living</ins> to reduce <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> daily cost. 
Besides, the elderly with less salary also have to lower their <del><Wci>living standard</Wci></del><ins>standard of living</ins>; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> a less stable situation. 
There are also some older people <del><Ssub>live</Ssub></del><ins>who</ins> a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation. 
They can live a happy life, but actually to the society as a whole, it is a waste of social <del><Nn>resource</Nn></del><ins>resources</ins>. 
Also, the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may <del><Rloc->become</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>resistance</Wform></del><ins>resist</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> positive social change. 
Above all, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 

However, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> growing life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> <del><WOinc>also <del</WOinc></del><ins>is also</ins>><Wci>mean</Wci></del><ins></ins> an achievement to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> human society. 
Actually, living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize. 
There are many factors which will result in the death of people, such as natural disasters, accident, diseases or suicides. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Long</ArtOrDet></del><ins>A long</ins> <del><Mec>life span</Mec></del><ins>lifespan</ins> for the individual <del><Rloc->himself</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> life full of problems. 
For the whole society, rising life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> are a symbol of more <del><Vform>advances</Vform></del><ins>advanced</ins> science and technology especially in the medical field, better social environment and a safer world. 
Therefore, <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> need to appreciate the longer <del><Mec>life span</Mec></del><ins>lifespan</ins> and consider it as an achievement. 

Every coin has two sides. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The rising</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Rising</ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> like a <del><Mec>two side</Mec></del><ins>two-sided</ins> sword <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the modern world.

What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and in the same time appreciate its great meanings.

Itstatisticallya balancedPopulationExpectancy:</ins>ctancies ,</Mec></del><ins></ins> Not Only an Achievement, But Also a Challenge . 
According to recent research, population ageing is a global phenomenon and the current average life span is over 65. 
The rising of life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is not only an achievement, but also a great challenge. 

Obviously, rising <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> is a mark of our achievements in terms of <del><Wform>hospitalizing</Wform></del><ins>hospital</ins> technology, insurance condition, <del><Wform>culture</Wform></del><ins>cultural</ins> development, and our social system, which shows the <del><Nn>improvements</Nn></del><ins>improvement</ins> of people's <del><Wci>life quality</Wci></del><ins>quality of life</ins>. 
Thanks to the development of technology and society, some deadly diseases in the past are curable now, and people are more aware of how to take care of our body. 
This is <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> great achievement made by <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> generation. 

At the same time, it is also a great challenge. 
With <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> population ageing and the increasing <del><Wci>portion</Wci></del><ins>number</ins> of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> old people, we are facing lots of problems now. 

For individuals, since people's life <del><Nn>expectancies</Nn></del><ins>expectancy</ins> are becoming longer, there will be more troubles for them to take care of themselves, especially for those who live alone or have diseases and are poor. 
For example, it becomes hard for them to earn their <del><Nn>livings</Nn></del><ins>living</ins>; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses <del><Vt>died</Vt></del><ins>have died</ins>; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases. 
And they may not get as much attention from their family as before. 

For families, certainly, the burden <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> young people <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>has</ins> <del><Vform>becomes</Vform></del><ins>become</ins> heavier. 
In China, lots of families only have one child. 
That means when the child grows up, <del><Pref>they</Pref></del><ins>he or she</ins> <del><SVA>need</SVA></del><ins>needs</ins> to take care of both parents. 
One family at least should take care of four old people. 
For a few groups of families, there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also <del><Vform>live</Vform></del><ins>living</ins> with them. 
Besides financial burdens, they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them. 
These may be too much for these young parents as they still need to look after their own children. 

For society, when the group of old people becomes larger and less people can work for the society, this society may lack of <del><Wform>labours</Wform></del><ins>labourers</ins>. 
And at the same time, these old people take up a larger portion of <del><Nn>resource</Nn></del><ins>resources</ins> and <del><Mec>budges</Mec></del><ins>budget</ins> of this society. 
To some degree, it will delay the economic development of the world. 
Besides, society needs to figure out more policies to secure old people's lives. 

Also, the population ageing calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and <del><Trans>technology,</Trans></del><ins>technology and</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>higher</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a higher</ins> level of civilization of our life. 
If our spiritual aspect of civilization cannot match our material aspect, old people will have <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> tough twilight years. 

Now population aging is a trend. 
It is an achievement of our society, but it is also a great challenge calling us to face the new situation.

In the old times, people could easily lose their life due to hunger, disease, government, war or something else.

Millions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen. 
There was everywhere wandering people trying to find food. 
Some people even eat their own dead children. 
There was a saying which says that hunger can <del><Wci>bring</Wci></del><ins>turn</ins> people back to animals.

Since no one knew about this disease before, it spread around the whole world before <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> <del><Vform>taking</Vform></del><ins>took</ins> action. 
The spreading speed was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about it. 
An atmosphere of death covered the whole world. 
The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The war</ArtOrDet></del><ins>War</ins> kills a lot of people, which is not <del><Wform>doubtful</Wform></del><ins>doubted</ins>. 
After going through the WW1 and WW2, the population on the earth got much fewer. 

<del><Trans>No matter because</Trans></del><ins>Because</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> technology was not developed enough or because there were wars and battles one after another, people just <del><Wtone>didn't</Wtone></del><ins>did not</ins> live a long life. 
Hence, as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated, people <del><Wtone>don't</Wtone></del><ins>do not</ins> risk their lives anymore. 
People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance. 
The medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today. 
Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance, the world in all is getting better in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>this</ins> field. 
With modern <del><Nn>machine</Nn></del><ins>machines</ins> and growing <del><Nn>method</Nn></del><ins>methds</ins>, <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> <del><Wtone>don't</Wtone></del><ins>do not</ins> need to worry about the amount of food anymore. 
All the achievements <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> make influence the lifespan of people. 
That is why population ageing can be seen as an achievement. 

Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though. 
As <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society develops, people gradually find that population ageing <del><Vt>brings</Vt></del><ins>has brought</ins> us many problems. 
With more and more people not working at all and receiving <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> allowance from the government, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society's balance <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>has been</ins> broken. 
It is difficult to keep <del><ArtOrDet>economy</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the economy</ins> functioning well. 
Times <del><Srun>change,</Srun></del><ins>change;</ins> people change. 
Many young people <del><Wtone>don't</Wtone></del><ins>do not</ins> view things like their parents used to do. 
Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before. 
This problem is very common in developed countries. 
With <del><ArtOrDet>more</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a more</ins> perfect system with the <del><Wform>old</Wform></del><ins>older</ins> and more modern equipment, population ageing always comes first. 
The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem. 
For example, they encourage people to have more children by awarding them. 
They pull up the age to retire. 
No matter what measures they take, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> population ageing still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies.
