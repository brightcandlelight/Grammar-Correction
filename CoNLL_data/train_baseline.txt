For the first part, rising life expectancies is a challenge. 	For the first part, rising life <del> expectancies </del> <ins> expectancy </ins> is a challenge. 
We should  or globally is also rising. 	We <del> should  </del> <ins> can </ins><del> image </del> <ins> imagine </ins> that when the life <del> expectancies </del> <ins> expectancy </ins> <del> are </del> <ins> raises </ins> <del> raised  </del> <ins>  </ins><del> up </del> <ins>  </ins><del> ; </del> <ins> , </ins> this will mean that the average age <del> for </del> <ins> of </ins> the population <del> in </del> <ins>  </ins> <del> nation </del> <ins> nationally </ins> <del> wise </del> <ins>  </ins> or globally is also rising. 
The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher. 	The number of the older people will increase to make the average life <del> expectancies </del> <ins> expectancy </ins> higher. 
For these older people, the and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them. 	For these older people, <del> the </del> <ins>  </ins> society <del> need </del> <ins> needs </ins> <del> man power </del> <ins> manpower </ins> and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them. 
Sometimes, older and resources than normal young people. 	Sometimes, <del> older </del> <ins> older people </ins> need more <del> man power </del> <ins> manpower </ins> and resources than normal young people. 
However society. 	<del> However </del> <ins> Moreover </ins>, these older people usually contribute less or <del> nearly have </del> <ins> have nearly </ins> no productivity <del> for  </del> <ins> in </ins><del> the </del> <ins>  </ins> society. 
We have to say that the and resources. 	We have to say that <del> the </del> <ins>  </ins> older people are becoming a <del> black hole </del> <ins> blackhole </ins> for the entire society in terms of <del> man power </del> <ins> manpower </ins> and resources. 
So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age. 	So the dilemma <del> takes place </del> <ins> occurs </ins> when there are more people who have a higher age. 
Not only has. 	Not only <del> has </del> <ins>  </ins> the <del> family member </del> <ins> families </ins> of the old people, but also the government <del> needed </del> <ins> need </ins> to <del> spend </del> <ins> put </ins> a lot of effort <del> to </del> <ins> into </ins> <del> handle </del> <ins> handling </ins> such <del> situation </del> <ins> a situation </ins>. 
This is the interpretation of challenge. 	This is the interpretation of <del> challenge </del> <ins> the challenge </ins> <del> for </del> <ins> of </ins> rising life <del> expectancies </del> <ins> expectancy </ins>. 
For the second part, rising life expectancies is also an achievement. 	For the second part, rising life <del> expectancies </del> <ins> expectancy </ins> is also an achievement. 
The achievement is some kind of history in the past. 	The achievement is <del> some kind of </del> <ins> in </ins> <del> a </del> <ins>  </ins> comparison with <del> the </del> <ins>  </ins> history in the past. 
In the healthy. 	In <del> the </del> <ins>  </ins> ancient <del> time </del> <ins> times </ins>, due to the <del> less </del> <ins> lower </ins> development of science and technology, people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care <del> for </del> <ins> of </ins> <del> their </del> <ins> the </ins> healthy. 
Hence people died of various diseases. 	<del> Hence </del> <ins> Hence, </ins> people died of various diseases. 
On the other hand, there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people's daily life. 	On the other hand, there <del> are </del> <ins> were </ins> not sufficient materials or ways to improve people's daily life. 
People do. 	People <del> do </del> <ins> did </ins> not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed <del> tooth </del> <ins>  </ins>. 
These small things makes the quality of people's life less enjoyable than today. 	These small things <del> makes </del> <ins> made </ins> the quality of people's life less enjoyable than today. 
Bad life. 	<del> Bad </del> <ins> A bad </ins> mood cannot give them a longer <del> time of </del> <ins>  </ins> life. 
Due to all these reasons, people died quite early, which results life expectancy. 	Due to all these reasons, people died quite early, which <del> results </del> <ins> resulted </ins> in a <del> low </del> <ins> lower </ins> life expectancy. 
So, the. 	So, <del> the </del> <ins> a </ins> <del> mark for how <del> l </del> <ins>  </ins>ong </del> <ins> longer </ins> is <del> the </del> <ins>  </ins> life expectancy <del> is indicating </del> <ins> indicates </ins> how well people <del> is living </del> <ins> live </ins>.

Population ageing <del> also has </del> <ins> has also </ins> brought us <del> a </del> <ins>  </ins> <del> question </del> <ins> debate </ins> on <del> whether we should raise </del> <ins>  </ins> life <del> expectancies </del> <ins> expectancy </ins><del> , it </del> <ins> .

In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, if people still increase the humans' life, but for these small developed regions, especially land.

So rising life expectancies limited resources. 	So rising life <del> expectancies </del> <ins> expectancy </ins> will make the world population <del> larger, more </del> <ins> larger and more </ins> people <del> shall </del> <ins> would </ins> <del> the </del> <ins> share the </ins> limited resources.
