Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing 
What is genetic risk? Genetic risk refers <del><Rloc->more</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease
People get certain <del><Nn>disease</Nn></del><ins>diseases</ins> because of genetic changes. 
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear. 
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease. 
The opposite is also true. 
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it is still possible that you <del><Vt>develop</Vt></del><ins>will develop</ins> heart disease. 
<del><Mec>However</Mec></del><ins>However,</ins> for some rare diseases, people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease. 
When we are <del><Rloc->diagonosed out</Rloc-></del><ins>diagnosed</ins> with <del><ArtOrDet>certain</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a certain</ins> genetic disease, are we <del><Vt>suppose</Vt></del><ins>supposed</ins> to disclose this result to our relatives? My answer is no

On <del><ArtOrDet>one</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the one</ins> hand, we do not want this potential danger <del><Wci>causing</Wci></del><ins>to have</ins> <del><Mec>firghtenning</Mec></del><ins>frightening</ins> <del><Mec>affects</Mec></del><ins>effects</ins> <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> our families' later lives. 
When people around us know that we <del><Vm>got</Vm></del><ins>have got</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>certain</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a certain</ins> disease, their <del><Mec>altitudes</Mec></del><ins>attitudes</ins> will <del><WOadv>be easily</WOadv></del><ins>easily be</ins> changed, <del><Others>whether </Others></del><ins>whether it be</ins><del><Prep>caring</Prep></del><ins>caring about</ins> us too much or keeping away from us. 
And both are not what we want <del><Mec>since</Mec></del><ins>, since</ins> most of us just want to live as normal people. 
Surrounded by such concerns, it is very likely that we <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>will be</ins> <del><Wform>distracted</Wform></del><ins>too distracted</ins> to worry about these problems. 
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life, because we will never know when the ''potential bomb'' will explode. 

On the other hand, if there are <del><Wci>ways</Wci></del><ins>things</ins> <del><Ssub>can</Ssub></del><ins>that can</ins> help us to control or cure the disease, we can <del><Vform>going</Vform></del><ins>go</ins> through <del><Mec>thses</Mec></del><ins>this</ins> process <del><Prep>from the scope of</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> the whole family. 
<del><ArtOrDet>For an example</ArtOrDet></del><ins>For example</ins>, if exercising is helpful <del><ArtOrDet>for </ArtOrDet></del><ins>for a</ins><del><WOinc>family potential</WOinc></del><ins>potential family</ins> disease, we can always look for more chances for the family to <del><Wci>go</Wci></del><ins>do</ins> exercise. 
And we <del><Vm>keep</Vm></del><ins>can keep</ins> track of all family <del><Mec>members</Mec></del><ins>members'</ins> <del><Rloc->health conditions</Rloc-></del><ins>health</ins>. 
At the same time, we are prepared to know when there are other <del><Ssub>members</Ssub></del><ins>members who</ins> <del><Vt>got</Vt></del><ins>have got</ins> this disease. 

Here I want to share <del><Mec>Forest'view</Mec></del><ins>Forest's view</ins> on this issue. 
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington's disease has <del><Wci>an ethical</Wci></del><ins>a moral</ins> obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings, there <del><WOadv>currently is</WOadv></del><ins>is currently</ins> no legal requirement to do so. 
In fact, requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious.<del><Mec>"</Mec></del><ins></ins> . 
Nothing is <del><Wform>absolute</Wform></del><ins>absolutely</ins> right or wrong. 
If <del><ArtOrDet>certain</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a certain</ins> <del><WOinc>disease genetic test</WOinc></del><ins>genetic test for a disease</ins> is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and <del><Spar>known</Spar></del><ins>to make it known</ins> <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> others, it is OK to disclose the result. 
Above all, life is more important than <del><Wform>secret</Wform></del><ins>secrecy</ins>. 

Genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle. 
<del><Mec>Afterall</Mec></del><ins>After all</ins>, what affects one family may or may not affect another <del><Mec>although </Mec></del><ins>, although</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> families <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> a common genetic <del><Mec>make up</Mec></del><ins>make-up</ins>, shared by either of the parents. 
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder, disclosing <del><Pref>or</Pref></del><ins>it or</ins> otherwise<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> to his or her <del><Nn>relative</Nn></del><ins>relatives</ins> is solely a matter of preference within the <del><Mec>indivdial</Mec></del><ins>individual</ins> moral <del><Wci>system</Wci></del><ins>code</ins>. 

The issue <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>right</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the right</ins> to know or not to know is highly <del><Srun>debatable although</Srun></del><ins>debatable. 
Although</ins> <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>there</ins> is a genetic risk, one cannot be <del><Wform>entire</Wform></del><ins>entirely</ins> sure because the genetic information could possibly <del><Wci>result</Wci></del><ins>come</ins> from the <del><Nn>families</Nn></del><ins>family</ins> of either <del><Nn>parents</Nn></del><ins>parent</ins> - <del><Pref>his</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> maternal and paternal uncles, aunts or <del><Nn>cousin</Nn></del><ins>cousins</ins>. 
This also means that <del><Trans>as soon</Trans></del><ins>as soon as</ins> a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile, he or she <del><Mec>concurently</Mec></del><ins>concurrently</ins> has <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> knowledge about others. 
This knowledge <del><Mec>maybe</Mec></del><ins>may be</ins> <del><Mec>relavant</Mec></del><ins>relevant</ins> to them, and vice versa. 
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer. 
It is hereditary. 
<del><SVA>Do</SVA></del><ins>Does</ins> <del><Pform>one</Pform></del><ins>someone</ins> who <del><Vt>suffered</Vt></del><ins>suffers</ins> from this disease keep it a secret <del><Mec>of</Mec></del><ins>or</ins> <del><Mec>infrom</Mec></del><ins>inform</ins> their relatives? In retrospect, <del><Pform>its</Pform></del><ins>it</ins> is also <del><Mec>ones</Mec></del><ins>one's</ins> duty to ensure that <del><Pref>he or she</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> undergo periodic <del><Mec>healthchecks </Mec></del><ins>health checks</ins><del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> their own

Sometimes some family <del><Nn>structure</Nn></del><ins>structures</ins> and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication. 
Depending on <del><Pform>whom</Pform></del><ins>who</ins> the genetic risk was discovered <del><Prep>from</Prep></del><ins>in</ins>: the son or <del><Mec>daughter</Mec></del><ins>daughter,</ins> for example, the parents who <del><SVA>knows</SVA></del><ins>know</ins> about this would decide who gets told and <del><Pform>whom</Pform></del><ins>who</ins> takes <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> precedence in being 'allowed' to tell. 
For example, within a family, regardless of who had first received <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> information, parents were seen as having the primary responsibility <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><Vform>pass</Vform></del><ins>passing</ins> on information to any offspring, <del><Trans>either</Trans></del><ins>or</ins> <del><Mec>adult</Mec></del><ins>adult,</ins> at risk. 
In addition, a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself, although this may be further complicated by an individual's response to risk information as they <del><Vm>not</Vm></del><ins>may not</ins> want to know. 
Hence, there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know (such as nieces and nephews) nor persuade those with authority (the parents) to do so. 

The notion of authority also extended 'vertically'. 
For example, a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt, even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is. 
From a practitioner's perspective these findings are important <del><Mec>because</Mec></del><ins>because,</ins> if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social <del><Mec>construct</Mec></del><ins>construct,</ins> they may not be in line with geneticists' views of family relationships, or about which blood (or non-blood) relatives should be informed and by whom; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context. 

Ultimately, one must <del><Wci>bring</Wci></del><ins>draw</ins> attention to who may benefit from such information and <del><Spar>assisting</Spar></del><ins>assist</ins> those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure. 
Whose duty it is to inform <del><Mec>at risk</Mec></del><ins>at-risk</ins> relatives or not greatly depends on the personal <del><Wci>moral</Wci></del><ins>moral code</ins> and the nature of how 'directive' the risk is to them. 

People with <del><ArtOrDet>close</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla close</ins> blood relationship generally carry some similar genes. 
In this case, if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a genetic</ins> risk, it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others <del><Vform>known</Vform></del><ins>know</ins> about the risk so that his/her <del><Mec>familay</Mec></del><ins>family</ins> members are able to <del><Wci>perform</Wci></del><ins>do</ins> some daily <del><Wci>excesses</Wci></del><ins>exercises</ins> to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the <del><Mec>correspongding</Mec></del><ins>corresponding</ins> <del><Um>flows</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
In my opinion, although the <del><Wci>annouance</Wci></del><ins>disclosure</ins> of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of <del><Wci>self</Wci></del><ins>personal</ins> privacy, it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell <del><Rloc->the issue to</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease. 
I agree with this statement to a large extent. 

<del><Others>Focus</Others></del><ins>I will focus</ins> on the negative side of the <del><Wci>annouance</Wci></del><ins>disclosure</ins> of genetic risk first. 
Large numbers of patients with <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> genetic risk would want to keep it <del><Prep>as</Prep></del><ins></ins> a secret as the genetic risk may <del><Vform>indicates</Vform></del><ins>indicate</ins> their high chance <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Vform>carry </Vform></del><ins>carrying</ins><del><ArtOrDet>certain</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a certain</ins> disease. 
<del><Smod>Especially for the young people without marrige, if</Smod></del><ins>This is especially the case for young people who are unmarried. 
If</ins> he/she is known to have some genetic risk, <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>there</ins> may <del><Wci>have</Wci></del><ins>be</ins> <del><SVA>certain</SVA></del><ins>a</ins> chance that his/her child <del><Vm>would</Vm></del><ins>will</ins> carry the same disease, but not <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> certain. 
Therefore, to keep the information <del><Prep>as</Prep></del><ins></ins> secret <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> his/her future <del><Mec>spouce</Mec></del><ins>spouse</ins> would help the relationship. 
Secondly, <del><Mec>annouance</Mec></del><ins>disclosing</ins> the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this <del><Rloc->certain</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> issue<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins>.</ins> <del><Mec>although</Mec></del><ins>Although</ins> the <del><Um>factor</Um></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>would</Wci></del><ins>might</ins> not be that serious, people would still fear that they <del><Vm>would</Vm></del><ins>will</ins> have some potential disease in the future <del><Trans>thus</Trans></del><ins>, and so,</ins> go to hospital and do additional <del><Nn>check</Nn></del><ins>checks</ins> or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease, and this <del><Mec>creats</Mec></del><ins>creates</ins> unnecessary costs <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> the family. 
Furthermore, the <del><Mec>annouance</Mec></del><ins>disclosure</ins> of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives <del><Mec>as</Mec></del><ins>as,</ins> <del><Mec>sometimes</Mec></del><ins>sometimes,</ins> others may <del><Wci>think not</Wci></del><ins>not want</ins> to stay too close to the <del><Mec>carrier</Mec></del><ins>carrier,</ins> so that they have less chance <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Vform>get</Vform></del><ins>getting</ins> the potential disease. 

On the other hand, if the genetic risk is kept <del><Prep>as</Prep></del><ins></ins> a secret, although it may benefit the carrier to a certain <del><Mec>extend</Mec></del><ins>extent</ins> and help to <del><Wci>keep </Wci></del><ins>protect</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> privacy, <del><Trans>but</Trans></del><ins></ins> it has much <del><Wci>larger</Wci></del><ins>greater</ins> negative impacts <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> the family members and relatives. 
First, <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the case of <del><Mec>marrige</Mec></del><ins>marriage</ins>, people should be honest and tell <del><Pref>his/her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> <del><Mec>spouce</Mec></del><ins>spouse</ins> they may carry <del><ArtOrDet>certain</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a certain</ins> genetic risk that <del><Vm>may</Vm></del><ins>might</ins> affect their <del><Nn>offsprings</Nn></del><ins>offspring</ins>. 
It is better to let the other party know the <del><Nn>fact</Nn></del><ins>facts</ins> <del><Others>than</Others></del><ins>, rather than wait until</ins> after the baby is born and <del><ArtOrDet>certain</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a certain</ins> type of genetic disease is found. 
It is better for both parties to be honest. 
Secondly, genetic disease has a close relationship with the <del><Um>born gene</Um></del><ins></ins> together with their daily habits. 
For example, if a carrier is told that he/she has the risk <del><Prep>to </Prep></del><ins>of</ins><del><Vform>have</Vform></del><ins>having</ins> diabetes. 
In this case, the carrier <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> eat <del><Wci>less</Wci></del><ins>fewer</ins> candies and chocolates to prevent <del><Vform>intake</Vform></del><ins>taking in</ins> <del><Mec>to</Mec></del><ins>too</ins> much <del><Nn>sugars</Nn></del><ins>sugar</ins>, and at the same time, if the carrier <del><SVA>tell</SVA></del><ins>tells</ins> this information to the relatives, it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future <del><Mec>becouse</Mec></del><ins>because</ins> of related <del><Mec>genes</Mec></del><ins>genes,</ins> and they can <del><Wci>perform</Wci></del><ins>do</ins> the same exercise to <del><Wform>intake</Wform></del><ins>take in</ins> less sugar to prevent the disease. 
Otherwise, if the other parties <del><Vt>did</Vt></del><ins>do</ins> not know, they may end up with <del><Rloc->to have</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>diabete</Mec></del><ins>diabetes</ins> in the future without any prevention. 

In conclusion, we <del><Vm>could</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> <del><Wci>tell</Wci></del><ins>see</ins> <del><Trans>the</Trans></del><ins>that the</ins> benefits of <del><Wci>telling</Wci></del><ins>disclosing</ins> genetic risk to the <del><Npos>carriers</Npos></del><ins>carriers'</ins> relatives <del><Wci>overweights</Wci></del><ins>outweigh</ins> the costs. 
Therefore, it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to <del><Wci>tell</Wci></del><ins>give</ins> the information to the relatives, in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily <del><Nn>exercises</Nn></del><ins>exercise</ins>. 

<del><Rloc->Among all kinds of different diseases, a</Rloc-></del><ins>After alla closeA</ins> large <del><Wci>amount</Wci></del><ins>number</ins> of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic <del><Wci>reasons</Wci></del><ins>factors</ins>. 
Genetic <del><Nn>disorder</Nn></del><ins>disorders</ins> may or may not be <del><Rloc->hirataged</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> hereditary <del><Nn>disease</Nn></del><ins>diseases</ins> and it is sometimes hard to find <del><Trans>out</Trans></del><ins>out whether</ins> one has these kinds of diseases. 
<del><Pref>It</Pref></del><ins>There</ins> is a <del><Wform>long time</Wform></del><ins>long-standing</ins> <del><Wci>discussion</Wci></del><ins>debate</ins> <del><Prep>that</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by <del><ArtOrDet>gene</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a gene</ins>. 
<del><Rloc->From the legal aspect</Rloc-></del><ins>Legally</ins>, the answer is no <del><Mec>but </Mec></del><ins>but,</ins><del><Rloc->from the ethical aspect</Rloc-></del><ins>ethically</ins>, the answer should be yes. 

We can't <del><Wci>make</Wci></del><ins>pass</ins> a law to <del><Wci>push</Wci></del><ins>compel</ins> a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about <del><Spar>his</Spar></del><ins>his or her</ins> genetic problem. 
It is immoral and impractical. 
Firstly, <del><WOinc>someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy</WOinc></del><ins>what kinds of diseases someone has is a matter or personal privacy</ins>. 
<del><Mec>Privicy</Mec></del><ins>Privacy</ins> <del><Rloc->protection</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> belongs to one's human rights. 
If a law requires someone to tell <del><Mec>others'</Mec></del><ins>others</ins> <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> <del><Wci>privacy</Wci></del><ins>private details</ins> <del><Mec>especially</Mec></del><ins>, especially</ins> when <del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins><del><Spar>one is</Spar></del><ins>they are</ins> not willing to do so<del><Srun>. 
It</Srun></del><ins>, it</ins> is againt <del><Spar>his or her</Spar></del><ins>their</ins> human rights and it is against the <del><Wci>law's spirit</Wci></del><ins>spirit of the law</ins>. 
The <del><Wci>law's spirit</Wci></del><ins>spirit of the law</ins> also <del><SVA>include</SVA></del><ins>includes</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> fairness. 
What is the basic difference between genetic <del><Nn>disorder</Nn></del><ins>disorders</ins> and other disorders<del><Mec>.</Mec></del><ins>?</ins> It is unfair to <del><Wci>release</Wci></del><ins>pass</ins> a law only <del><Wci>point</Wci></del><ins>pertaining</ins> to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> genetic <del><Nn>disorder</Nn></del><ins>disorders</ins>
In addition, it is impractical to <del><Wci>make</Wci></del><ins>pass</ins> such a law. 
A good law should be clear and easy to <del><Wci>execute</Wci></del><ins>enforce</ins>. 
However, there are many problems <del><Prep>againt</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> <del><Rloc->the execution of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> asking a carrier to tell his or her <del><Mec>ralatives</Mec></del><ins>relatives</ins> the cause of his or her <del><Nn>diseases</Nn></del><ins>disease</ins>. 
Firstly, what is the range of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> relatives? For example, does the carrier only need to tell <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> direct <del><Mec>relatives</Mec></del><ins>relatives,</ins> like parents and brothers and <del><Mec>sisters</Mec></del><ins>sisters,</ins> or <del><Spar>does he</Spar></del><ins>do they</ins> also need to tell relatives like <del><Spar>his</Spar></del><ins>their</ins> grandmother's sister's son's daughter's nephew? If you say <del><Pref>only</Pref></del><ins>they </ins> need to tell direct relatives, it will be against the <del><Rloc->fairness of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> law
Other relatives may have the same possibilities <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Vform>have </Vform></del><ins>having</ins><del><ArtOrDet>such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>this</ins> kind of disease. 
How can a law <del><Wci>made</Wci></del><ins>passed</ins> by <del><ArtOrDet>government</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the government</ins> <del><Wci>exempt</Wci></del><ins>exclude</ins> such a group of people from preparing to face their <del><Mec>potetial</Mec></del><ins>potential</ins> disease? 
However, from the ethical point of view<del><Mec>.</Mec></del><ins>,</ins> <del><Prep>To</Prep></del><ins></ins> the carrier <del><Rloc->himself of herself, he of she</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> should have a feeling of <del><Mec>resposiblity</Mec></del><ins>responsibility</ins> to tell <del><Spar>his or her</Spar></del><ins>their</ins> <del><Prep>relatives</Prep></del><ins>relatives about</ins> their genetic disorder. 
By doing this ,they may be able to save <del><ArtOrDet>some</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> lives of their relatives. 
<del><Pref>It</Pref></del><ins>This</ins> is because a carrier <del><ArtOrDet>with</ArtOrDet></del><ins>with a</ins> bad gene may not <del><Wform>necessary</Wform></del><ins>necessarily</ins> <del><Wci>have</Wci></del><ins>develop</ins> <del><SVA>those</SVA></del><ins>the</ins> genetic disease<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> if they can have <del><Wci>coresponding</Wci></del><ins>a</ins> healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene's function <del><SVA>become</SVA></del><ins>becomes</ins> stronger. 
A typical example is <del><Wform>genetic</Wform></del><ins>genetically</ins> caused hypertension. 
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make <del><WOinc>the carrier harder</WOinc></del><ins>it harder for the carrier</ins> to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause hypertension. 
People usually get this kind of <del><Mec>hypertesion</Mec></del><ins>hypertension</ins> after they become <del><Nn>adult</Nn></del><ins>adults</ins>. 
However, if they already know they have a gene that may make them <del><ArtOrDet>have </ArtOrDet></del><ins>have a</ins><del><Wci>higher</Wci></del><ins>greater</ins> <del><Nn>possibilities</Nn></del><ins>possibility</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Vform>get</Vform></del><ins>getting</ins> <del><Mec>hypertention</Mec></del><ins>hypertension</ins><del><Mec>. 
They</Mec></del><ins>, they</ins> can <del><Wci>build</Wci></del><ins>adopt</ins> a daily habit <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Vform>eat</Vform></del><ins>eating</ins> less salt and fat and thus <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> avoid hypertension. 

<del><Wtone>In a nutshell</Wtone></del><ins></ins>, our society can't <del><Wci>push</Wci></del><ins>compel</ins> genetic problem <del><Nn>carrier</Nn></del><ins>carriers</ins> to tell <del><WOinc>his or her disease to his or her relatives</WOinc></del><ins>their relatives about their disease</ins> but <del><Pref>he or she</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> should be willing to tell <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> relatives about <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> genetic problem. 
<del><Wci>By doing so ,</Wci></del><ins>If they do so,</ins> <del><Wci>less</Wci></del><ins>fewer</ins> of <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> <del><Wci>beloved</Wci></del><ins>loved</ins> ones will suffer from the genetic problem. 

In <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAan</ins> age of rapid technological advancement, a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible. 
Genetic testing is made possible and available for <del><Um>one's decision to undergo</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
It is able to detect <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> illnesses or diseases and even a child's parentage. 
However, it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk <del><Trans>to</Trans></del><ins>whether to</ins> inform his or her relatives. 
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared <del><Prep>within</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> the family or relatives, there might <del><Wci>have</Wci></del><ins>be</ins> chances for them to have it in their blood<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> which they may <del><Wci>do</Wci></del><ins>take</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>necessary</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the necessary</ins> precautions to prevent. 
But, if <del><WOinc>it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease</WOinc></del><ins>the genetic disease is a terminal disease</ins>, most <del><Rloc->of the</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> relatives will be disheartened upon <del><WOinc>having the knowledge</WOinc></del><ins>learning</ins> about it. 
Therefore, some carriers will <del><Wci>have the opinion of</Wci></del><ins>want to</ins> <del><Vform>keeping</Vform></del><ins>keep</ins> it <del><Prep>as</Prep></del><ins></ins> a secret. 
This essay will discuss <del><Prep>about</Prep></del><ins></ins> whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not. 

Some <del><Vt>said</Vt></del><ins>say</ins> that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> personal information which should be kept confidential. 
Most patients will be depressed after <del><Wci>realising </Wci></del><ins>finding out about</ins><del><Pref>his or her </Pref></del><ins>their</ins><del><Nn>conditions</Nn></del><ins>condition</ins>. 
If <del><Pref>one</Pref></del><ins>someone</ins> has a genetic <del><Mec>disease</Mec></del><ins>disease,</ins> after the test, <del><Pref>he or she</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> might not wish to inform <del><Pref>the</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> relatives as <del><Pref>he</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> might <del><Vform>ended</Vform></del><ins>end</ins> up <del><Vform>dishearten</Vform></del><ins>disheartening</ins> <del><Pref>his</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> extended family. 
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> any pessimism into their family. 
Furthermore, some will wish not to become a burden <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Mec>anyone</Mec></del><ins>anyone,</ins> as seeking medical attention is relatively costly. 
Hence, some <del><Vt>seen</Vt></del><ins>see</ins> it as being considerate <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> confidential. 

On the other hand, others may think that it <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> be considerate to tell the <del><Mec>relatives</Mec></del><ins>relatives,</ins> because the latter will have a higher <del><Wci>tendency</Wci></del><ins>chance</ins> of <del><Wci>getting</Wci></del><ins>having</ins> the same genetic risk. 
Hence, they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to <del><Wci>do</Wci></del><ins>take</ins> some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease. 
Nevertheless, it will depend on what kind of genetic <del><Nn>diseases</Nn></del><ins>disease</ins>, <del><Rloc->given</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> in the context of current medical technology. 
For example, breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is <del><Wci>being realised</Wci></del><ins>detected</ins> in the early stage. 
Hence, with the knowledge of having <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a genetic</ins> risk, the relatives of <del><Others>this</Others></del><ins>someone with this</ins> genetic disease will <del><Wci>do</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> a medical check-up, which might save them <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> <del><Wci>realising</Wci></del><ins>detecting</ins> it at <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> earlier stage. 

In conclusion, it <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> be considerate to inform <del><WOinc>the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives</WOinc></del><ins>relatives of the risk of getting the same genetic disease</ins>. 
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way <del><Wci>in</Wci></del><ins>when</ins> seeking medical attention, such as financial <del><Nn>issue</Nn></del><ins>issues</ins>, everyone should be given the <del><Nn>rights</Nn></del><ins>right</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Vform>knowing</Vform></del><ins>to know</ins> their family's <del><Mec>inherented</Mec></del><ins>inherited</ins> medical conditions. 
However, some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant <del><Prep>about</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> it <del><Trans>and</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> <del><Pref>will</Pref></del><ins>they will</ins> continue leading a happy life. 
In addition, some may think that even knowing about having <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> risk of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> disease<del><Rloc->, it</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> will just <del><Vform>adding</Vform></del><ins>add</ins> <del><Prep>on to</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it. 
All-in-all, it depends on <del><ArtOrDet>individual</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the individual</ins> and also the nature of the disease, but <del><Wci>he or she</Wci></del><ins>people</ins> should be obligated to inform <del><Pref>the</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> relatives if there are possibilities <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> curing or preventing <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>the condition</ins>. 

Genectic testing is a personal decision, <del><V0>with</V0></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade with</ins> the <del><Mec>kowledge</Mec></del><ins>knowledge</ins> that there is a possiblity that one could be a carrier or not. 
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing, even <del><Rloc->though</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> if there is no risk at all. 
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will <del><Wci>cast away</Wci></del><ins>remove</ins> unwanted doubts and affect the <del><Wci>psychological thoughts</Wci></del><ins>thinking</ins> of those who are affected. 

For a genetic risk carrier, there should be <del><ArtOrDet>choice</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a choice</ins> given with regards to informing his/her relatives. 
<del><Pref>There</Pref></del><ins>They</ins> should not be forced or <del><Mec>obligied</Mec></del><ins>obliged</ins> to do so, as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier. 
With regard to this choice <del><Rloc->given</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>, there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of <del><Wci>decision making</Wci></del><ins>choice </ins>. 
If the genetic risk carrier is <del><Rloc->a minor or a child</Rloc-></del><ins>a minor</ins>, then most likely the decision <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> informing the <del><Nn>relative</Nn></del><ins>relatives</ins> should be made <del><Prep>with the consideration of</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> the <del><Npos>patients</Npos></del><ins>patient's</ins> parents or legal guardian. 
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of <del><ArtOrDet>such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> genetic disorder due to their young age. 
<del><Mec>Furthermore</Mec></del><ins>Furthermore,</ins> the act of informing others without the consent <del><Prep>from</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> their parents or the patients <del><Pform>itself</Pform></del><ins>themselves</ins> could harm the psychological state of the affected family. 
Thus, much thought <del><SVA>need</SVA></del><ins>needs</ins> <del><V0>to</V0></del><ins>to be</ins> put <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>into</ins> the immediate <del><Mec>family</Mec></del><ins>family,</ins> as it could <del><Vt>caused</Vt></del><ins>cause</ins> a <del><Wci>stir</Wci></del><ins>chaos</ins> of unwanted events <del><Prep>from</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> the patient or the family members <del><Pform>itself</Pform></del><ins>themselves</ins>. 
Some <del><Wci>family</Wci></del><ins>family members</ins> may feel hurt <del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> with regards to their family pride or reputation<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> on having the knowledge of <del><ArtOrDet>such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> genetic disorder running in their family. 

However, there is a <del><Um>role</Um></del><ins></ins> and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder. 
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree. 
The importance of informing relatives of <del><ArtOrDet>such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention <del><Prep>towards</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> the genetic disorder. 
Also, this <del><Rloc->known</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and <del><Mec>tosimilarly</Mec></del><ins>to similarly</ins> undergo genetic <del><Mec>testingto</Mec></del><ins>testing to</ins> find out about the outcome. 
Thus, having the knowledge that <del><ArtOrDet>such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial <del><Prep>towards</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> their <del><Mec>emotinal</Mec></del><ins>emotional</ins> <del><Wci>thoughts</Wci></del><ins>well-being</ins>. 
And if the results turn out to be otherwise, then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> the future outcome <del><Ssub>and</Ssub></del><ins>and this will</ins> aid them in making upcoming decisions. 
In addition, the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it <del><Vt>is been</Vt></del><ins>has been</ins> made known to them. 
Having support from relatives <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> vital as they <del><Wci>ensure</Wci></del><ins>assure</ins> the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this <del><Mec>illness</Mec></del><ins>illness,</ins> and it will certainly provide a morale <del><Mec>boost</Mec></del><ins>boost,</ins> as the whole family will share a common <del><Wci>sentiment</Wci></del><ins>feeling</ins> with regards <del><Prep>towards</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> the future prospect of the genetic <del><Mec>disorder</Mec></del><ins>disorder,</ins> which could be inherited by anyone in the family. 
Therefore, the decision to inform relatives of <del><ArtOrDet>such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> genetic disorder will be dependent <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> the situation and <del><Mec>backgroung</Mec></del><ins>background</ins> of the affected family, with the <del><Wci>liberty</Wci></del><ins>freedom</ins> of choice given to them in making the decision <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> informing others. 

A person with a disorder, <del><WOinc>regardless of</WOinc></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be a</ins> mental or physical disorder, is always <del><Um>easy to be awared</Um></del><ins></ins> by his or her <del><Nn>families</Nn></del><ins>family</ins>. 
When <del><Wci>things</Wci></del><ins>it</ins> <del><SVA>come</SVA></del><ins>comes</ins> to genetic issues, it is not that simple anymore. 
Genetic disorder <del><Um>inheritance is generation by generation</Um></del><ins></ins>, but not all of the <del><Nn>offsprings</Nn></del><ins>offspring</ins> show the relevant symptoms. 
Sometimes a family <del><ArtOrDet>with</ArtOrDet></del><ins>with a</ins> <del><WOinc>potential genetic disorder risk</WOinc></del><ins>risk of potential genetic disorder</ins> may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members <del><Wci>reflect</Wci></del><ins>display</ins> any observable <del><Rloc->disorder</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> symptoms. 
As a result, <del><Rloc->in the case that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> when one of the members <del><SVA>happen</SVA></del><ins>happens</ins> to feel uncomfortable or <del><Wci>unnormal</Wci></del><ins>unwell</ins>, he or she should <del><V0>aware</V0></del><ins>be aware</ins> <del><Prep>that</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not. 
<del><Mec>Afterward</Mec></del><ins>Afterwards</ins>, the carrier will face a serious ethical issue, which <del><Trans>is</Trans></del><ins>is whether</ins> to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not. 

If the disorder symptoms <del><Wci>reflect</Wci></del><ins>are displayed</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> a <del><Wtone>kid</Wtone></del><ins>child</ins>, the parent will be informed by the medics <del><Wtone>for sure</Wtone></del><ins></ins>, then the whole family will <del><Wci>stay</Wci></del><ins>be</ins> alert to their bodies' condition. 
<del><Wci>On contrary</Wci></del><ins>In contrast</ins>, if the carrier is an adult<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> who has <del><Pref>his</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> own choice to choose whether to inform <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> relatives about the risk, that will be more complex. 
One <del><Vm>may</Vm></del><ins>might</ins> think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> family more than <del><Pref>himself</Pref></del><ins>themself</ins>, there is no doubt that <del><Pref>he or she</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> will tell <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> family about the issue. 
That is true <del><Mec>and</Mec></del><ins>and,</ins> of <del><Mec>course</Mec></del><ins>course,</ins> it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family. 
<del><WOinc>Think of the other way</WOinc></del><ins>Conversely</ins>, if a child <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the family knows that he has the risk <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Vform>become</Vform></del><ins>becoming</ins> a genetic risk carrier, and the risk might <del><Wci>as well</Wci></del><ins>also</ins> <del><Vt>inherit</Vt></del><ins>be inherited</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> his child in the future, <del><WOinc>his whole life will be in a dilenma</WOinc></del><ins>he will be in a dilemma his whole life</ins>. 
And of course, he or she will think of not having any <del><Nn>child</Nn></del><ins>children</ins> after getting married, and the same thought <del><Wci>goes</Wci></del><ins>occurs</ins> to the cousins as well. 
As a result, the family <del><Wci>generation</Wci></del><ins>line</ins> stops <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins></ins> the moment the adult carrier announces his <del><Wci>issue</Wci></del><ins>problem</ins>. 

In China, the older generation <del><ArtOrDet>with</ArtOrDet></del><ins>with a</ins> traditional <del><Wform>culture</Wform></del><ins>cultural</ins> background<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren, to make the family <del><Wci>liven up</Wci></del><ins>more lively</ins> and stronger. 
The reason <del><Pref>behind</Pref></del><ins>behind this</ins> is that after <del><Wa>WOWII</Wa></del><ins>WWII</ins> the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government <del><Vt>encourage</Vt></del><ins>encouraged</ins> the people to <del><WOinc>give more birth</WOinc></del><ins>have more children</ins>. 
During that period, if one of the family <del><Nn>member</Nn></del><ins>members</ins> <del><Wci>reflects</Wci></del><ins>displayed</ins> genetic disorder symptoms, he <del><Vt>will</Vt></del><ins>would</ins> <del><Wci>fell</Wci></del><ins>be</ins> in an ethical <del><Mec>dilenma</Mec></del><ins>dilemma</ins> for sure. 
The medical <del><Rloc->treatment</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> technology during that time <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> not advanced enough to completely cure him. 
He <del><Vt>has</Vt></del><ins>had</ins> to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more <del><Wform>prosperity</Wform></del><ins>prosperous</ins> with a potential <del><Mec>generic</Mec></del><ins>genetic</ins> risk. 
And so, he would have chosen not to undergo <del><Mec>generic</Mec></del><ins>genetic</ins> disorder testing and <del><Vform>let</Vform></del><ins>to let</ins> the truth be <del><Wci>mined</Wci></del><ins>buried</ins> forever. 
This kind of ethical issue cannot be judged by <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family. 

In <del><Wform>conclude</Wform></del><ins>conclusion</ins>, people should think carefully <del><ArtOrDet>of</ArtOrDet></del><ins>about</ins> what <del><WOinc>is the consequences</WOinc></del><ins>the consequences are</ins> of telling the <del><Prep>relatives</Prep></del><ins>relatives about</ins> <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> <del><Mec>generic</Mec></del><ins>genetic</ins> disorder <del><Rloc->issue</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives, but also an obligation for a family member to <del><Wci>liven up</Wci></del><ins>add to</ins> the family. 
<del><Wci>Regardlessly</Wci></del><ins>Even</ins><del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> if the disorder is rarely <del><Rloc->to be</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> fatal<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> or it does not <del><Vt>caused</Vt></del><ins>cause</ins> any inconvenience to the carrier, revealing the truth is always the right thing to do. 

In my opinion, the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it. 
One of the reasons <del><Rloc->why</Rloc-></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be a</ins> is <del><Trans>because</Trans></del><ins>that</ins> <del><Mec>as</Mec></del><ins>, as</ins> a carrier, she or he needs <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>mental</Wci></del><ins>moral</ins> support to go through <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> this situation. 
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on <del><Pref>its</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> own. 
<del><Smod>By telling </Smod></del><ins>If they tell</ins><del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Pref>his or her </Pref></del><ins>their</ins><del><Mec>family</Mec></del><ins>family,</ins> other than being a support, they could possibly help <del><Pref>her</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> to <del><Wci>get</Wci></del><ins>find</ins> alternative solutions to the problem that <del><Pref>she</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> facing right now. 
Other than that, I believe that the <del><Mec>stong</Mec></del><ins>strong</ins> bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier. 
Furthermore, as it is a genetic problem, it <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> be better for the carrier to inform his or her <del><Mec>family</Mec></del><ins>family,</ins> as other family <del><Nn>member</Nn></del><ins>members</ins> might experience the same thing. 
<del><Smod>By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem</Smod></del><ins>If they are made aware of this genetic problem</ins>, they could have a full check-up <del><Rloc->for themselves</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> and it <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> be better if they could even prevent it from happening to <del><Pform>themselves</Pform></del><ins>them</ins>. 
I <del><Wci>find</Wci></del><ins>think</ins> that it is important to <del><Others>inform</Others></del><ins>family members</ins> <del><Mec>especially</Mec></del><ins>, especially</ins> if it is contagious<del><Srun>, the</Srun></del><ins>. 
The</ins> carrier could prevent the disease from spreading <del><Rloc->out</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 

For every action there <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> always pros and cons. 
I believe that some <del><Rloc->of the</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> carriers will choose <del><WOadv>to not</WOadv></del><ins>not to</ins> reveal their disease to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> family <del><Mec>members</Mec></del><ins>members,</ins> as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even <del><Spar>feel</Spar></del><ins>to feel</ins> ostracized by them. 
Furthermore, as it could <del><Wci>incur</Wci></del><ins>involve</ins> spending <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> lots of money <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> the treatment, the carrier might not want to be <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> burden <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Pref>her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> family. 
I <del><Vm>could</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> understand the <del><Nn>feeling</Nn></del><ins>feelings</ins> of the carrier. 
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in <del><Mec>thefamily</Mec></del><ins>the family</ins>. 
However, we will never know whether <del><Pform>this</Pform></del><ins>these</ins> negative effects will <del><Wci>happen</Wci></del><ins>arise</ins> when the carrier <del><SVA>decide</SVA></del><ins>decides</ins> to tell his or her family <del><ArtOrDet>of </ArtOrDet></del><ins>about</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> his or her condition. 

In conclusion, <del><Mec>personally</Mec></del><ins>personally,</ins> I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform <del><Pref>her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> family members about the issue. 
The carrier should be honest <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> his or her <del><Nn>feeling</Nn></del><ins>feelings</ins> <del><Mec>and</Mec></del><ins>, and</ins> I <del><Wci>find</Wci></del><ins>think</ins> that it is the right of the family <del><Nn>member</Nn></del><ins>members</ins> to know what is going on <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> his or her life. 
If anything <del><Wci>wrong</Wci></del><ins>bad</ins> <del><Vt>happened</Vt></del><ins>happens</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the carrier's life<del><Mec>, </Mec></del><ins></ins><del><Smod>without informing</Smod></del><ins>without their having informed</ins> the family <del><Mec>members</Mec></del><ins>members,</ins> it could <del><Wci>make</Wci></del><ins>lead to</ins> a huge regret in their life if <del><Pref>she</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><SVA>leaves</SVA></del><ins>leave</ins> without them knowing about it. 
On top of that, it is better to think about solutions <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Pref>her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> problem with the family <del><Mec>members</Mec></del><ins>members, </ins> as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on <del><Pref>your</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> own. 
<del><Wci>In the end</Wci></del><ins>Finally</ins>, I believe that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>support </Mec></del><ins>support,</ins><del><Trans>in terms of</Trans></del><ins>whether</ins> mental or even <del><Wci>monetary</Wci></del><ins>financial</ins> <del><Mec>from</Mec></del><ins>, from</ins> <del><Pref>your</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease. 
<del><Wtone>True enough that there</Wtone></del><ins>There</ins> are lots of <del><Npos>cancer's</Npos></del><ins>cancer</ins> <del><Nn>patient</Nn></del><ins>patients</ins> who were given <del><ArtOrDet>second</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a second</ins> <del><Wci>choice</Wci></del><ins>chance</ins> to live as <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> normal <del><Nn>person</Nn></del><ins>people</ins> <del><Trans>as</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> they <del><Vt>have</Vt></del><ins>had</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> strong <del><Wci>mental</Wci></del><ins>moral</ins> support from their <del><Nn>loved one</Nn></del><ins>loved ones</ins>. 
In my opinion, as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong, we can fight any <del><Mec>disease</Mec></del><ins>disease,</ins> <del><Trans>as</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> they come to us when we are fragile and weak. 

As <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be a</ins> <del><Mec>techonology</Mec></del><ins>technology</ins> has <del><Vt>been advancing</Vt></del><ins>advanced</ins>, it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the <del><Mec>acutual</Mec></del><ins>actual</ins> use of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>techonology</Mec></del><ins>technology</ins>. 
Genetic testing has been made possible<del><Mec>-</Mec></del><ins>;</ins> it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing. 
If used for a good purpose, it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness<del><Srun>, however</Srun></del><ins>. 
However</ins>, it could also make <del><ArtOrDet>situation</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a situation</ins> worse by revealing who the carrier is, in the family. 
The question <del><Rloc->given</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her <del><Mec>relatives</Mec></del><ins>relatives,</ins> and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do <del><Mec>so</Mec></del><ins>so,</ins> because I <del><Mec>belive</Mec></del><ins>believe</ins> that he or she has <del><ArtOrDet>right</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the right</ins> not to know. 

Firstly, genetic testing is not something that is compulsory. 
Of course, some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier<del><Srun>, however</Srun></del><ins>. 
However</ins>, the carrier, before the testing, can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts. 
If he chooses to live <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> the uncertainty that the gene holds and <del><V0>willing</V0></del><ins>is willing</ins> to accept it, he <del><Vm>could</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> do that, and it <del><Vt>has been</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> something that <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> 'normal' <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> everyone in the <del><Mec>past</Mec></del><ins>past,</ins> as <del><Mec>gentic</Mec></del><ins>genetic</ins> testing was not possible. 
It could <del><Prep>rather</Prep></del><ins>even</ins> be better for him or her <del><ArtOrDet>this</ArtOrDet></del><ins>that</ins> way. 

Some people might say that it is a form of prevention <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>against</ins> giving birth to disabled <del><Wci>lives</Wci></del><ins>offspring</ins> and making them suffer in <del><Mec>real-life</Mec></del><ins>real life</ins>. 
I personally think this <del><Mec>ist he</Mec></del><ins>is the</ins> right purpose of going through <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> genetic testing, so that a family who cannot afford to have a disabled <del><Wtone>kid</Wtone></del><ins>child</ins> do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer. 
However, I <del><Mec>belive</Mec></del><ins>believe</ins> that the carrier has <del><ArtOrDet>right</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the right</ins> not to <del><Vt>obligate</Vt></del><ins>be obligated</ins> to tell <del><Rloc->anyone</Rloc-></del><ins>anyone,</ins> but has <del><ArtOrDet>responsibility</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a responsibility</ins> to take <del><ArtOrDet>an</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> action to prevent any ethical dilemma. 
If the result <del><Vt>turned</Vt></del><ins>turns</ins> <del><V0>out</V0></del><ins>out to be</ins> something that the carrier cannot <del><Mec>accept</Mec></del><ins>accept,</ins> then it would have been better not <del><Vform>knowing</Vform></del><ins>to know</ins> the truth. 

I <del><Mec>belive</Mec></del><ins>believe</ins> that even the carrier has the right not to know the <del><Rloc->true</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>fact</Nn></del><ins>facts</ins>. 
<del><Smod>After realizing </Smod></del><ins>After he or she realizes</ins><del><Trans>the</Trans></del><ins>that</ins> he or she is <del><Mec>tshe</Mec></del><ins>the</ins> carrier, the emotional damage would be hard to bear. 
It could possibly <del><Vform>causes</Vform></del><ins>cause</ins> a problem in a family <del><Rloc->due to the fact</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> and <del><Vform>creates</Vform></del><ins>cause</ins> more unhappiness <del><Mec>int</Mec></del><ins>in</ins> the family. 

Overall, I <del><Mec>belive</Mec></del><ins>believe</ins> that it entirely depends on the carrier <del><Trans>to</Trans></del><ins>whether to</ins> share the hard facts and face it with <del><Mec>relatives</Mec></del><ins>relatives,</ins> but he has no obligation to tell <del><Rloc->still</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
In fact, I strongly <del><Wci>think</Wci></del><ins>believe</ins> that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of <del><Wci>taking </Wci></del><ins>undergoing</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> genetic testing and <del><Mec>tak</Mec></del><ins>take</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>an</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> appropriate action <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>based on</ins> the results. 

The <del><Rloc->emotional depression</Rloc-></del><ins>depression</ins> that the carrier might <del><Wci>get</Wci></del><ins>suffer</ins> and the sense of <del><Wform>guilty </Wform></del><ins>guilt</ins><del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be more than expected and could be a burden <del><Rloc->in mind</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> for the rest of <del><Pref>the</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> life. 
On the other hand, without <del><Prep>knowing</Prep></del><ins>knowing about</ins> any genetic disorder and accepting the fact, the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the <del><Mec>diability</Mec></del><ins>disability</ins>. 
I think the family will stay mentally <del><Mec>healty</Mec></del><ins>healthy</ins> as it is, without having <del><Mec>emtional</Mec></del><ins>emotional</ins> stress. 

Debates have been around for years, <del><Trans>that</Trans></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whether</ins> <del><WOinc>should a carrier for a known genetic risk</WOinc></del><ins>a carrier of a known genetic risk should</ins> be obligated to inform his or her relatives. 
Any individual at risk <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing, but whether the results should be <del><Wci>informed</Wci></del><ins>disclosed</ins> to others, especially close family or <del><Others>relatives</Others></del><ins>distant relatives</ins>, is <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> topic <del><Rloc->that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> worth discussing. 
This is an <del><Pref>issue</Pref></del><ins>issue that</ins> <del><SVA>need</SVA></del><ins>needs</ins> to be addressed <del><ArtOrDet>as</ArtOrDet></del><ins>as a</ins> family-related ethical dilemma is involved. 
In this essay, <del><ArtOrDet>few</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a few</ins> arguments will be <del><Wci>pointed out</Wci></del><ins>put forward</ins> in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> support of <del><Rloc->view for</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> any carrier of <del><ArtOrDet>that</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> known genetic risk <del><Vform>to tell</Vform></del><ins>telling</ins> his or her relatives. 

When we were born, we were surrounded by our <del><Rloc->family and relatives</Rloc-></del><ins>relatives</ins>, with them welcoming us to this new world. 
We were crying hard but we <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> not alone<del><Srun>, it's</Srun></del><ins>. 
It's</ins> our <del><Rloc->family and relatives</Rloc-></del><ins>family</ins> that <del><Wci>grow</Wci></del><ins>bring</ins> us up. 
Hence, they <del><WOinc>should be the people</WOinc></del><ins>are people we should</ins> be grateful for and the people we would like to share <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> joy <del><Prep>together</Prep></del><ins>with</ins>. 
However, in the case <del><Prep>pertaining to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> any health issue or to the extent of <del><ArtOrDet>serious</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a serious</ins> disorder, <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>there</ins> may <del><Vform>seems</Vform></del><ins>seem</ins> <del><V0>no</V0></del><ins>to be no</ins> point <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><Mec>sharing</Mec></del><ins>sharing,</ins> but this involves more than just sharing of bad news. 
One definitely has the right <del><Others>to</Others></del><ins>not to</ins> disclose <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>one's</ins> health issues to anyone, but it's also one's responsibility to inform the <del><Rloc->family and close relatives</Rloc-></del><ins>family</ins>. 
<del><Trans>As the case of</Trans></del><ins>If</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>health</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a health</ins> issue is related to genetic risk, <del><ArtOrDet>with </ArtOrDet></del><ins>with the</ins><del><Wci>keyword</Wci></del><ins>emphasis</ins> on "genetic" <del><Pref>which</Pref></del><ins>, this</ins> highlights the risk of passing <del><Prep>down</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> the disorder to the next generation. 
Therefore, I would agree <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> that it's <del><Wci>obligated</Wci></del><ins>obligatory</ins> for a carrier of <del><ArtOrDet>known</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a known</ins> genetic risk to tell his or her <del><Mec>relatives</Mec></del><ins>relatives,</ins> to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could <del><Wci>be raise up</Wci></del><ins>arise</ins> in the future. 

<del><Trans>Despite</Trans></del><ins>Although</ins> one may argue that it's still up to the individual <del><Trans>to</Trans></del><ins>whether to</ins> disclose such <del><ArtOrDet>health</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a health</ins> issue or to <del><Wci>bear</Wci></del><ins>keep</ins> it <del><Prep>within</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> him/herself, it's certainly helpful to share with close relatives, for a proper discussion <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> solutions. 
By doing so, one will feel less <del><Wci>stressful</Wci></del><ins>stressed</ins> in facing <del><ArtOrDet>such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>such a</ins> <del><Wci>disorder</Wci></del><ins>health</ins> risk. 
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more <del><Wci>caring</Wci></del><ins>care</ins> towards the carrier of a known genetic risk. 
<del><Prep>By</Prep></del><ins>As a result of</ins> informing them, the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>such a</ins> <del><Wci>disorder</Wci></del><ins>health</ins> risk. 

On top of that, as the genetic risk may pass down to <del><ArtOrDet>next</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the next</ins> generation, <del><Trans>thus</Trans></del><ins></ins> it will involve more than just one family. 
It is <del><Wci>therefore</Wci></del><ins>for this reason</ins> I would agree <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> the obligation <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Vform>telling</Vform></del><ins>tell</ins> the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and <del><Spar>have</Spar></del><ins>has</ins> a plan for <del><Wci>giving birth</Wci></del><ins>raising a family</ins>. 
This would avoid the <del><Wci>rise</Wci></del><ins>incidence</ins> of more family-related ethical <del><Nn>dilemma</Nn></del><ins>dilemmas</ins>. 

There are more intangible advantages that could support <del><Rloc->the stand of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> informing the relatives once the results are known after the test <del><Vt>conducted</Vt></del><ins>has been conducted</ins>. 
In conclusion, in order to avoid <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> family-related ethical <del><Nn>dilemma</Nn></del><ins>dilemmas</ins>, it is best for any carrier of <del><ArtOrDet>known</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a known</ins> genetic risk to inform his/her relatives. 
The benefits of doing so <del><Rloc->are able to</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> outweigh its disadvantages. 
More <del><Nn>supports</Nn></del><ins>support</ins> must be provided through different means to give better <del><Wci>direction</Wci></del><ins>guidance</ins> when <del><Pref>one</Pref></del><ins>someone</ins> is <del><Wci>standing of such junction</Wci></del><ins>deliberating</ins> whether <del><Pref>should</Pref></del><ins>they should</ins> <del><Rloc->him/her</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> inform <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their</ins> relatives. 

The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherof</ins> a disorder. 
This is the common law in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
However, it leads to a new problem <del><Others>that</Others></del><ins>that can be summarised as</ins> "should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives?" This issue has been discussed for a long time
However, there is still a diversity of <del><Nn>point of views</Nn></del><ins>points of view</ins> among <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> people. 
Thus, we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue <del><Rloc->which is "should or should not"</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 

Firstly, I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below: "I <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> be anxious about my <del><Nn>families</Nn></del><ins>family member</ins> <del><Trans>when</Trans></del><ins>if</ins> he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk". 
Frequently, the <del><Wci>intention</Wci></del><ins>reason</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> the carriers <del><Vform>does not want</Vform></del><ins>not wanting</ins> to tell their families <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> to continue their own life without the <del><Wform>anxious</Wform></del><ins>anxiety</ins> of <del><ArtOrDet>families</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their families</ins>. 
It is obvious that <del><Pref>there</Pref></del><ins>it</ins> will be better for one person to be worried than many. 

However, many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges <del><Wci>oneself</Wci></del><ins>on their own</ins>. 
With the families' support, there must be more energy to fight against <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> the demon. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Demon</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The demon</ins> is not easily <del><Rloc->to be</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> defeated and it <del><Vt>is required</Vt></del><ins>requires</ins> much <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> energy and psychological support. 
Families give you the courage and support which you cannot <del><Wci>retrieve</Wci></del><ins>find</ins> by yourself. 
That is the most essential <del><Nn>elements</Nn></del><ins>element</ins> to overcome the challenges. 

Besides that, the risk of the known <del><Others>genetic</Others></del><ins>disorder</ins> is <del><Wci>very</Wci></del><ins>so</ins> serious that it cannot be described. 
The seriousness can be <del><Wci>larger</Wci></del><ins>bigger</ins> than our imagination. 
Lying on <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> bed for <del><Wci>the remaining life</Wci></del><ins>the rest of your life</ins>, and even <del><Spar>die</Spar></del><ins>dying</ins> immediately, these are <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> consequences which we cannot imagine. 
Families are <del><ArtOrDet>our </ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins><del><Others>dearest</Others></del><ins>dearest people</ins> in our life. 
Without their concern and support, <del><Um>we are hard to stay until this time</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
They play <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> important role in our life which cannot be substituted. 
A known genetic risk can also <del><WOadv>affect our next generation critically</WOadv></del><ins>critically affect the next generation</ins>. 
Therefore, it is our responsibility to tell <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>our</ins> <del><Mec>relatives</Mec></del><ins>relatives,</ins> to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences. 

Generally, the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier's <del><Nn>families</Nn></del><ins>family</ins> without the agreement of <del><ArtOrDet>carrier</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the carrier</ins>. 
It is the ethic of staff in <del><ArtOrDet>hospital</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a hospital</ins> to keep the secret of any patients. 
<del><Um>We cannot blame them that they are liable to the undesired consequences</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
However, <del><ArtOrDet>hospital</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the hospital</ins> can provide a <del><Wci>councilor</Wci></del><ins>counsellor</ins> to <del><Wform>advice</Wform></del><ins>advise</ins> the carrier about the action <del><Pref>can</Pref></del><ins>that can</ins> be taken. 
Therefore, this kind of <del><Nn>circumstances</Nn></del><ins>circumstance</ins> will not <del><Vform>be happened</Vform></del><ins>happen</ins> again and again. 
It is a method that benefits <del><ArtOrDet>two </ArtOrDet></del><ins>the two</ins><del><Mec>parties</Mec></del><ins>parties,</ins> which is a win-win situation. 

In conclusion, a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk. 
However, there may be some special case that is hard to <del><Vform>be defined</Vform></del><ins>define</ins>. 
Thus, advice from <del><ArtOrDet>hospital</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the hospital</ins> plays <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> important role <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> this. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Carrier</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The carrier</ins> is responsible <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><Vform>balance</Vform></del><ins>balancing</ins> his or her own <del><Nn>interest</Nn></del><ins>interests</ins> and the benefits <del><Prep>of </Prep></del><ins>to</ins><del><ArtOrDet>family</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the family</ins> and even society. 
It is a hard decision to make but <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> <del><V0>the</V0></del><ins>choosing the</ins> most appropriate way, it will create great circumstances for the carrier <del><ArtOrDet>and</ArtOrDet></del><ins>and their</ins> <del><Nn>families</Nn></del><ins>family</ins> in the future. 

With the risk of <del><Wci>being</Wci></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving a</ins> <del><Wform>genetically</Wform></del><ins>genetic</ins> disorder, many individuals have <del><Wci>done</Wci></del><ins>made</ins> the decision to undergo genetic testing. 
With the <del><Wci>nature</Wci></del><ins>knowledge</ins> that the results will be known once the tests are done, each individual that is diagnosed <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>as</ins> <del><Vform>be</Vform></del><ins>being</ins> a genetic risk carrier <del><SVA>face</SVA></del><ins>faces</ins> an ethical <del><Wci>problem</Wci></del><ins>dilemma</ins>: <del><WOinc>They should</WOinc></del><ins>should they</ins> warn their relatives about the <del><Wform>risking</Wform></del><ins>risk</ins> of being <del><WOinc>the same genetic risk carrier</WOinc></del><ins>a carrier of the same genetic risk</ins><del><Mec>.</Mec></del><ins>?</ins> Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed
<del><Wci>In the view of my point</Wci></del><ins>In my view</ins>, a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives, <del><Rloc->with the support</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> the following reasons. 

First of all, from the <del><Wci>angle</Wci></del><ins>point of view</ins> of human <del><Nn>right</Nn></del><ins>rights</ins>, a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others. 
This diagnosis can be regarded as a <del><Wci>kind of privacy</Wci></del><ins>private matter</ins> to carriers. 
They may <del><Rloc->do</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> not want this truth to influence their life or <del><Spar>want</Spar></del><ins>may want</ins> to keep it as a secret and <del><Rloc->do</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><V0>not</V0></del><ins>not let</ins> others know about it. 
This is reasonable since <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated <del><Prep>or</Prep></del><ins>against or</ins> <del><Um>sympothized</Um></del><ins></ins> by <del><Mec>others</Mec></del><ins>others,</ins> which <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> not positive factors brought to their life. 

<del><Mec>Seconly</Mec></del><ins>Secondly</ins>, the relatives of the carrier can also choose to <del><Wci>do</Wci></del><ins>undergo</ins> genetic <del><Mec>testing</Mec></del><ins>testing,</ins> regardless of the <del><Mec>dignosis</Mec></del><ins>diagnosis</ins> of the carrier. 
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers, they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it. 
If they do not want to think too much <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> it and view it as a <del><Wci>trouble</Wci></del><ins>problem</ins>, they may just ignore the possibility. 
However, if a <del><Mec>dignosed</Mec></del><ins>diagnosed</ins> carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives, the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers. 
This <del><Um>obeys</Um></del><ins></ins> their own <del><Wci>willingness</Wci></del><ins>wishes</ins> as <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> they have to accept the <del><Mec>truth</Mec></del><ins>truth,</ins> which may make their <del><Wci>following</Wci></del><ins>subsequent</ins> life miserable. 

Many people <del><Mec>many</Mec></del><ins>may</ins> argue that <del><Wci>setting</Wci></del><ins>establishing</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> obligation may help more people<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> who are the relatives of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> carriers<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> save their lives <del><Rloc->with a larger opportunity</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> because of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> early diagnosis. 
However, this is not exactly true when other <del><Mec>factors</Mec></del><ins>factors,</ins> including psychological influence, social influence, are taken into consideration. 
If one such relative is told that he or she may <del><ArtOrDet>have</ArtOrDet></del><ins>have a</ins> higher risk of getting sick, he or she may <del><Rloc->have</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> be scared about the <del><Wci>unknown life</Wci></del><ins>future</ins>, partners, spouse and colleagues may choose to leave, and many other situations may <del><Wci>happen</Wci></del><ins>arise,</ins> which means the relative's life may be ruined. 
On the other <del><Wci>side</Wci></del><ins>hand</ins>, as stated above, a person who <del><SVA>want</SVA></del><ins>wants</ins> to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually. 

<del><Wtone>In a nutshell</Wtone></del><ins>In summary</ins>, a carrier of a known genetic risk should have <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> <del><Rloc->own</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not. 
This should be accepted from the point <del><Others>of</Others></del><ins>of view of</ins> human <del><Nn>right</Nn></del><ins>rights</ins>, freedom of acceptance of relatives <del><Trans>as well as</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> <del><Prep>many</Prep></del><ins>for many</ins> other social reasons. 
Otherwise, making it an obligation will <del><Mec>restric</Mec></del><ins>restrict</ins> the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives. 

For a carrier of <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa genetic</ins> <del><Mec>disorder</Mec></del><ins>disorder,</ins> <del><Rloc->to</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Vform>know</Vform></del><ins>knowing</ins> the fact that he or she is a carrier<del><Rloc->, it</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> causes more dilemma <del><Rloc->rather</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> than getting the disorder. 
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives. 
There are four reasons why people <del><Wci>don't have to</Wci></del><ins>shouldn't</ins> be shy and <del><Spar>share</Spar></del><ins>should share</ins> their problems regarding <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a genetic</ins> disorder. 

Firstly, the carrier and his or her family can take precautions, <del><Mec>physically</Mec></del><ins>physically,</ins> <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>through</ins> actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> offspring and, <del><Mec>mentally</Mec></del><ins>mentally,</ins> if the action fails to prevent it being inherited. 
Many <del><Mec>syndromes</Mec></del><ins>syndromes,</ins> such as Down Syndrome and Taylor <del><Mec>Syndrome</Mec></del><ins>Syndrome,</ins> can be prevented <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> <del><Wci>happen</Wci></del><ins>occurring</ins> if the mother <del><SVA>undergo</SVA></del><ins>undergoes</ins> proper medication and <del><SVA>don't</SVA></del><ins>doesn't</ins> consume harmful <del><Wci>goods</Wci></del><ins>foods</ins> during the pregnancy period. 
This information may not be known by the mother if she doesn't tell her relatives <del><Prep>regarding</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> her condition. 
<del><ArtOrDet>More</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The more</ins> people (relatives) <del><Prep>know</Prep></del><ins>know about</ins> her problem, <del><ArtOrDet>more</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the more</ins> information <del><Nn>channel</Nn></del><ins>channels</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> provided. 
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the <del><Mec>syndrome</Mec></del><ins>syndrome,</ins> then the family have to accept this fact and do whatever they can to <del><Wci>bring</Wci></del><ins>provide</ins> a good environment for their children's growth. 
This is not the parent's fault because there <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> still chances of the gene being inherited. 
So, they <del><WOadv>have to also</WOadv></del><ins>also have to</ins> prepare mentally. 

Secondly, genetic diseases <del><SVA>costs</SVA></del><ins>cost</ins> <del><Wci>highly</Wci></del><ins>a great deal</ins> for the treatment and medication. 
Albinism is one of the examples. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The people</ArtOrDet></del><ins>People</ins> with albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment. 
Unlike people with <del><ArtOrDet>high</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a high</ins> proportion of skin pigment, people with albinism <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> prone to sunburn and other skin diseases. 
If they don't treat their body well, <del><Wci>such as</Wci></del><ins>for example,</ins> by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>outdoor</Mec></del><ins>outdoors</ins>, <del><Wci>the chances are good</Wci></del><ins>there is a good chance</ins> that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer. 
Once you suffer from cancer, the medication <del><Nn>cost</Nn></del><ins>costs</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> very expensive. 
To prevent the bigger problem <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> <del><Vform>happen</Vform></del><ins>happening</ins>, it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body. 
If the carrier doesn't tell his or her relatives, it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially. 

Thirdly, some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems. 
One of the diseases is sickle cell <del><Wci>trait</Wci></del><ins>anaemia</ins>. 
<del><Mec>Usually</Mec></del><ins>Usually,</ins> people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory <del><Nn>problem</Nn></del><ins>problems</ins> such as blood <del><Wci>blocking</Wci></del><ins>clots</ins>. 
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their <del><Mec>relatives</Mec></del><ins>relatives,</ins> then they can <del><Wci>bring</Wci></del><ins>take</ins> their children to undergo genetic testing and don't need to be shy <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> it because it is for the sake of their children's health. 

Fourthly, it is important for the parents to give mental <del><Wci>boost</Wci></del><ins>encouragement</ins> <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> their children with <del><SVA>genetic</SVA></del><ins>a genetic</ins> disorder. 
When their children become teenagers, a lot of social problems may arise. 
<del><Wci>People</Wci></del><ins>Strangers</ins> and friends often mock <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> your <del><Nn>conditions</Nn></del><ins>condition</ins>. 
A strong mental condition and conviction must be <del><Vt>build</Vt></del><ins>built</ins> from within and <del><Prep>from</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> the closest <del><Wci>ones</Wci></del><ins>people</ins>. 
If not their <del><Mec>family</Mec></del><ins>family,</ins> then who else <del><Rloc->that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>will be</ins> willing to do that? It is not a <del><Wci>heavy</Wci></del><ins>difficult</ins> job for the family if they have <del><Vt>prepare</Vt></del><ins>prepared</ins> their <del><Wci>mental</Wci></del><ins>minds</ins> first by disclosing the information <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder

In this modern world, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa genetic</ins> <del><Nn>technologies</Nn></del><ins>technology</ins> <del><Vt>were</Vt></del><ins>has</ins> improved a lot compared with the last century. 
Particularly<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> in the medical field, there is <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> great improvement in many treatments for many <del><Wci>formally</Wci></del><ins>formerly</ins> incurable diseases, and genetic testing is one of the methods which <del><Vt>were</Vt></del><ins>are</ins> used to diagnose <del><Trans>an</Trans></del><ins>whether an</ins> individual <del><V0>at</V0></del><ins>is at</ins> risk <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> a genetic disorder. 
The medical authorities <del><Vt>claimed</Vt></del><ins>claim</ins> that only the individual who is at risk <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing. 
However, once a test has been conducted and the results are known, a family-related ethical dilemma is born. 
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives. 

In my opinion, the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this. 
This is because his or her relatives have the right to know about this. 
As many people realize, a genetic disorder can be <del><Wci>related</Wci></del><ins>passed on</ins> to the carrier's relatives, that is, one of the family members <del><Vform>is</Vform></del><ins>being</ins> at risk <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the <del><Wci>equally</Wci></del><ins>same</ins> risk <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Vform>have</Vform></del><ins>having</ins> it, so this problem should be treated seriously by the family. 
Every family member has <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> <del><Rloc->human</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> right to know what is going on with them. 
If they do not even know that they are at risk <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> a genetic disorder, <del><Um>how can this explain their right</Um></del><ins></ins>? For instance, John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling, <del><Mec>James</Mec></del><ins>James,</ins> about this
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent, he should know what <del><Vt>will be</Vt></del><ins>is</ins> likely to be going on <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> him. 
<del><Pref>This</Pref></del><ins>It</ins> might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder. 

The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the <del><Wci>similar</Wci></del><ins>same</ins> genetic disorder, preventing certain genetic disorders <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> <del><Vform>affect</Vform></del><ins>affecting</ins> <del><Pform>themselves</Pform></del><ins>them</ins>. 
Genetic disorders are innate, but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on <del><Pref>themselves</Pref></del><ins>them</ins>. 
In addition, doctors usually quote a statement, "Prevention is better than <del><Wform>curation</Wform></del><ins>cure</ins>"; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> <del><Vform>happen</Vform></del><ins>happening</ins> has far more advantages than curing it. 
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> a person, and therefore, this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible. 
For example, hypertension is partially due to genetic factors, but environmental factors also play an important role. 
People who <del><V0>aware</V0></del><ins>are aware</ins> of having <del><ArtOrDet>such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> disorder can prevent the disorder <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> <del><Wci>happen</Wci></del><ins>developing</ins> by <del><Wci>adapting</Wci></del><ins>adopting</ins> a healthy lifestyle, including having a balanced diet and <del><WOinc>at least having exercise for 30 minutes</WOinc></del><ins>having at least 30 minutes of exercise</ins> every day. 

To sum up, a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives. 
<del><Pref>This</Pref></del><ins>It</ins> is their human right to know about that, and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> <del><Wci>happen</Wci></del><ins>developing</ins>. 

Together with the advancement of technology over <del><Wci>past</Wci></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecent</ins> decades,medical <del><Wci>advancement</Wci></del><ins>progress</ins> has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly <del><Wci>upgrading.Empower </Wci></del><ins>being added. 
Empowered</ins><del><Rloc->doctors</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> with <del><Wform>advance</Wform></del><ins>advanced</ins> medical knowledge,doctors are able to diagnose and <del><Wci>undergo</Wci></del><ins>carry out</ins> genetic testing for patients to help them <del><Others>prevent</Others></del><ins>prevent illness</ins> and take <del><ArtOrDet>necessary</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the necessary</ins> steps to protect their life.However, once a test has been conducted and the results are known,<del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> question of disclosing the results to <del><Rloc->his or her</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> relatives <del><SVA>become</SVA></del><ins>becomes</ins> a challenging issue <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> both patient and doctor.<del><Rloc->In my opinion,</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>I feel <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> strong urge to support the obligation to inform <del><Npos>patient</Npos></del><ins>patients'</ins> relatives. 

As it is a genetic risk,the <del><Npos>patient</Npos></del><ins>patient's</ins> <del><Mec>next-of-skin</Mec></del><ins>next-of-kin</ins> might have a high chance of carrying the risk<del><Srun>,hence</Srun></del><ins>. 
Hence,</ins> the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary <del><Wform>prevention</Wform></del><ins>preventative</ins> <del><Wci>actions</Wci></del><ins>measures</ins> <del><Vm>could</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> be taken before unforeseen circumstances <del><Rloc->might </Rloc-></del><ins></ins><del><Wci>occur</Wci></del><ins>arise</ins>.For example,if you are the only child in a family <del><Mec>and</Mec></del><ins>and,</ins> unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic <del><Mec>disease </Mec></del><ins>disease,</ins><del><Rloc->that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> the genetic trait might be passed on to <del><ArtOrDet>your</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> next generation if you have a child<del><Srun>,hence</Srun></del><ins>. 
Hence,</ins> by <del><Wci>letting</Wci></del><ins>making</ins> your family members aware of the situation,<del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>you</ins> would lessen family stresses and suffering <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>owing to</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>forcing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their forcing</ins> you to settle down and have children.However, social <del><Wform>ethic</Wform></del><ins>ethical</ins> issues like discrimination and privacy are <del><ArtOrDet>biggest</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the biggest</ins> concerns and potential barriers to <del><Wci>enforce</Wci></del><ins>forcing</ins> patients or doctors to disclose information to <del><Npos>patients</Npos></del><ins>patients'</ins> relatives.It challenges <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996(HIPAA) in the United States,there is no legal obligation <del><Rloc->requirement</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> to disclose information to relatives<del><Srun>,it</Srun></del><ins>. 
It</ins> is up to the <del><Npos>patient's</Npos></del><ins>patient</ins> <del><Others>wish</Others></del><ins>what they wish</ins> to disclose to their family members.Early <del><Wform>disclosement</Wform></del><ins>disclosure</ins> to family members brings <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>positive</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a positive</ins> reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie<del><Srun>,she</Srun></del><ins>. 
She</ins> chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the shadow of cancer. 

However,there are still people <del><Others>against</Others></del><ins>who are against</ins> the decision <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Vform>revealing</Vform></del><ins>reveal</ins> private information.As in the case of <del><Npos>Alzheimer</Npos></del><ins>Alzheimer's</ins> patients,it is <del><Prep>up to</Prep></del><ins></ins> the patient's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret <del><Rloc->who,</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>how and <del><Prep>whom</Prep></del><ins>to whom</ins> <del><WOinc>will Alzheimer disease</WOinc></del><ins>Alzheimer's disease will</ins> be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><Nn>families</Nn></del><ins>family</ins> members (DementiaToday,2012).There are associations <del><Pref>provide</Pref></del><ins>who provide</ins> <del><Nn>helps</Nn></del><ins>help</ins> to <del><Mec>Alzheimer</Mec></del><ins>Alzheimer's</ins> <del><Mec>patients </Mec></del><ins>patients,</ins><del><ArtOrDet>like</ArtOrDet></del><ins>like the</ins> Alzheimer's Association (Alzheimer's Association,1980).Although there are still <del><Nn>thousand</Nn></del><ins>thousands</ins> <del><Others>of</Others></del><ins>of people with</ins> genetic <del><Rloc->risk</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> diseases out there that might not be receiving <del><Rloc->all </Rloc-></del><ins></ins><del><Nn>helps</Nn></del><ins>help</ins> and <del><Nn>supports</Nn></del><ins>support</ins> from everyone,the <del><Nn>needs</Nn></del><ins>need</ins> to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is <del><ArtOrDet>an</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> utmost help that patients need in their difficult time. 

In conclusion,the state should <del><Vform>have passed</Vform></del><ins>pass</ins> a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors <del><Um>that till which extend </Um></del><ins></ins><del><WOinc>should a doctor</WOinc></del><ins>a doctor should</ins> opt to <del><Wci>reveal to</Wci></del><ins>inform</ins> relatives <del><Rloc->members</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> about the genetic disease and in which situations it <del><Vm>is</Vm></del><ins>should be</ins> <del><Wci>open</Wci></del><ins>left</ins> to <del><ArtOrDet>patient's</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the patient's</ins> decision.In addition,the state could also encourage <del><Wci>to create</Wci></del><ins>the creation of</ins> assistance schemes to <del><Wci>aid</Wci></del><ins>offer</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>necessary</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the necessary</ins> help to <del><Rloc->needy</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> patients to encourage them to open up <del><WOinc>for the benefit of own and family members</WOinc></del><ins>for their own benefit and for that of family members</ins>.Although it may face challenges from social <del><Wform>ethic</Wform></del><ins>ethical</ins> issues,in <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> long term,with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government,more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate <del><Wform>measurements</Wform></del><ins>measures</ins> to protect their own health and <del><Spar>their</Spar></del><ins>that of their</ins> loved ones. 

Nowadays, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecent</ins> <del><Nn>study</Nn></del><ins>studies</ins> in the genetic field <del><Vt>has gone</Vt></del><ins>are going</ins> further and further due to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> high-velocity technological advancement. 
Not long ago, the human genome <del><Mec>project</Mec></del><ins>project,</ins> sponsored by several large multinational corporations <del><Mec>(MNCs)</Mec></del><ins>(MNCs),</ins> <del><Vt>has been</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> started. 
<del><Um>In comparison</Um></del><ins></ins>, in the field of genetic <del><Mec>testing</Mec></del><ins>testing,</ins> which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder, as the technology <del><Vt>has been</Vt></del><ins>is</ins> very mature already, an even more popular topic arises. 
While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not, they have different stands <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>regarding</ins> whether it is the patient's responsibility <del><Rloc->or freedom</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> to share the result with his or her relatives. 
In my opinion, the patients<del><Rloc->,</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Pref>which</Pref></del><ins>who</ins> are carriers of some known genetic risk <del><Vm>are supposed to</Vm></del><ins>should</ins> share the truth with their family members. 

Admittedly, it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people. 
<del><Prep>To</Prep></del><ins>For</ins> the whole society, it is a duty. 
Take H1N1 as an example<del><Srun>, all</Srun></del><ins>. 
All</ins> the people in <del><Mec>Singapore</Mec></del><ins>Singapore, </ins> including students at school, travelers at the Changi Airport, workers in the <del><Nn>office</Nn></del><ins>offices</ins> as well as <del><Wci>passengers</Wci></del><ins>pedestrians</ins> on the <del><Mec>street</Mec></del><ins>street,</ins> are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge. 
<del><Prep>To</Prep></del><ins>For</ins> those family members who care about them, it is also a moral obligation. 
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and <del><Wci>get</Wci></del><ins>put</ins> their loved ones in danger? The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and <del><SVA>love</SVA></del><ins>loves</ins> each other with no doubts
Without trust and love, there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together. 
Hence, it is essential to tell <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> family members about the risk of <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> genetic <del><Mec>disorder</Mec></del><ins>disorder,</ins> both as a social responsibility <del><Prep>and</Prep></del><ins>and as</ins> a favor to conserve the family <del><Rloc->basis</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 

Moreover, telling <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support. 
Without the support of loved ones, patients' <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> no better than death. 
Family members, as <del><Prep>one</Prep></del><ins>one of</ins> the closest <del><Nn>group</Nn></del><ins>groups</ins> of people from whom <del><Wci>they</Wci></del><ins>patients</ins> can get comfort, <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible <del><Wci>troubles</Wci></del><ins>problems</ins> as a result of genetic disorder. 
A study <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> New York University in 2010 <del><Vt>shown</Vt></del><ins>showed</ins> that patients with family members around generally <del><SVA>recovers</SVA></del><ins>recover</ins> 2-4 days faster than those taken <del><Prep>care</Prep></del><ins>care of</ins> by professional nurses. 
Even for those patients with terminal diseases, the duration of their survival is 30% longer due to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> family support. 
Some people may say that telling the truth may <del><Wci>arise</Wci></del><ins>give rise to</ins> some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> family harmony. 
While every family <del><SVA>need</SVA></del><ins>needs</ins> to go through this or that kind of troublesome <del><Nn>situations</Nn></del><ins>situation</ins>, the more <del><Wci>troubles</Wci></del><ins>problems</ins> <del><Rloc->that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> a family has gone through together, the greater <del><ArtOrDet>bond</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the bond</ins> will be <del><Rloc->established</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust, love and understanding. 
Hence, for a family in which every member <del><Vt>is truly believing</Vt></del><ins>truly believes</ins> in each other and <del><Vt>loving</Vt></del><ins>loves</ins> each other ,all these <del><Wci>troubles</Wci></del><ins>problems</ins> are just <del><Wform>testaments</Wform></del><ins>tests</ins> to make them stronger. 
Just <del><Prep>as</Prep></del><ins>like in</ins> the lyrics <del><ArtOrDet>of</ArtOrDet></del><ins>of</ins> Kelly Clarkson, what doesn't kill you <del><SVA>make</SVA></del><ins>makes</ins> you stronger. 

Being in Asian <del><Mec>society</Mec></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,</ins> where genetic testing is not a common practice, I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease. 
The courage to take the genetic testing and <del><Rloc->yet</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental <del><Mec>while actually</Mec></del><ins>while, actually,</ins> it is just a risk and not a confirmed case. 
Furthermore, since it is the person's gene that is affected, he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins>. 
Nevertheless, while I <del><Wci>fell</Wci></del><ins>feel</ins> that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic <del><Mec>risk,</Mec></del><ins>risk.</ins> I would like to suggest the person <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> at least <del><SVA>share</SVA></del><ins>shares</ins> the information with her or his potential partner (husband or wife<del><Mec>)</Mec></del><ins>),</ins> since the individual's genetic risk may affect their future children. 

Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them <del><V0>will</V0></del><ins>will be</ins> most likely to judge or at least <del><Wci>differentiate</Wci></del><ins>discriminate against</ins> those who have genetic <del><Mec>diseases</Mec></del><ins>diseases,</ins> since they feel that the patients are abnormal or 'weird'. 
This is because many relate genetic diseases to <del><Pref>those</Pref></del><ins>others</ins> such as Bubble-Boy disease, autism or <del><Mec>down-syndrome</Mec></del><ins>Down's syndrome</ins>. 
In those diseases, many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases. 
While we do know that we should not <del><Prep>discriminate</Prep></del><ins>discriminate against</ins> them based on their limitations, many people still do it with or without them realizing it. 
In this particular case, we are discussing <del><Prep>about</Prep></del><ins></ins> whether a person should tell his relatives about <del><Pref>him</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> having a RISK of a particular genetic disease. 
It is normal for people to demand <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> fair and similar treatment <del><Prep>as</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> others <del><Mec>and therefore</Mec></del><ins>and, therefore,</ins> it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently<del><Mec>.</Mec></del><ins>. 
</ins>Many people really love to hear what they want to hear <del><Mec>and therefore</Mec></del><ins>and, therefore,</ins> they may just ignore the word 'risk' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease. 
To prevent that from happening, I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his <del><Mec>family</Mec></del><ins>family, </ins> since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently. 
Especially when it is just a risk, the option is really <del><Mec>his</Mec></del><ins>his,</ins> since he is not an actual sufferer. 

There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the <del><Mec>risk</Mec></del><ins>risk,</ins> since some of them may be affected<del><Mec>, while</Mec></del><ins>. 
While</ins> I do think that this view has <del><Wci>a point</Wci></del><ins>some validity</ins>, how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case. 
<del><Mec>May be</Mec></del><ins>Maybe</ins> we can trust our immediate family <del><Mec>members</Mec></del><ins>members,</ins> but can we really trust all the other relatives? Furthermore, since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case, it is up to the <del><Rloc->person's call</Rloc-></del><ins>person</ins> <del><Trans>to</Trans></del><ins>whether to</ins> tell the relatives about it

However, as I said earlier, it is better for the person to at least tell <del><WOinc>about the potential risk to his or her future partner</WOinc></del><ins>his or her future partner about the potential risk,</ins> since his genetic risk may affect his children later. 
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children. 
There may <del><ArtOrDet>be </ArtOrDet></del><ins>be a</ins><del><Nn>possibilities</Nn></del><ins>possibility</ins> <del><Trans>when</Trans></del><ins>that</ins> both the husband and wife are <del><Mec>carriers and therefore</Mec></del><ins>carriers, and, therefore,</ins> they should not have any <del><Nn>child</Nn></del><ins>children</ins> since their <del><Nn>child</Nn></del><ins>children</ins> may not be able to survive even after they are born. 
Or in a less extreme case, the child may be disabled. 
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters<del><Mec>, therefore</Mec></del><ins>. 
Therefore,</ins> although no one is obliged to tell <del><WOinc>about their genetic risk to anyone</WOinc></del><ins>anyone about their genetic risk</ins>, <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> should be encouraged to tell <del><Rloc->it</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> their future partner. 

In conclusion, whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives <del><Prep>regarding</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> his genetic risk, the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full <del><Wci>right</Wci></del><ins>ownership</ins> of it. 
He may have different considerations <del><Um>other than due to the judging people</Um></del><ins></ins> or <del><Pref>may</Pref></del><ins>it may</ins> result in making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell <del><Rloc->it</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> his relatives, <del><Trans>and</Trans></del><ins>but</ins> no matter what choice he makes, we need to respect it and we have no right <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Vform>saying</Vform></del><ins>say</ins> that he must tell his relatives about it. 

We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person's death. 
With the improvements <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,in</ins> technology, a new life with <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a genetic</ins> risk can be detected. 
<del><Others>Genetic</Others></del><ins>Genetic risk</ins> <del><Prep>refers</Prep></del><ins>refers to</ins> the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease. 
<del><Mec>Therefore</Mec></del><ins>Therefore,</ins> an entirely new dilemma is born: should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives? This essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a genetic</ins> risk

One of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Vform>raise</Vform></del><ins>raising</ins> a child with <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a genetic</ins> risk. 
The child with <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a genetic</ins> risk may not have the ability to work, <del><Trans>to</Trans></del><ins>or to</ins> build up the family with the <del><Mec>others</Mec></del><ins>others,</ins> and most of the time they are not acceptable <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> the majority. 
They may not <del><V0>able</V0></del><ins>be able</ins> to enjoy <del><Others>a</Others></del><ins>a life</ins> normal people can enjoy. 
This competitive world is cruel to <del><Pref>those</Pref></del><ins>those who</ins> are not able to survive. 
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to <del><Wci>foster</Wci></del><ins>care for</ins> their child if he/she is not able to <del><Wci>foster</Wci></del><ins>look after</ins> himself/herself. 
The situation may become <del><Wform>worst</Wform></del><ins>worse</ins> if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease, which means that parents have another heavy <del><Wci>baggage</Wci></del><ins>burden</ins> <del><Wci>named</Wci></del><ins>called</ins> medication fees. 
Not only the child but also the <del><Wform>entirely</Wform></del><ins>entire</ins> family will suffer. 
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can <del><Wci>foster</Wci></del><ins>take care of</ins> a new life that <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> not able to work and may suffer <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> pain <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their</ins> entire life. 

The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of genetic risk is for a nation's good. 
There are always newspaper <del><Nn>report</Nn></del><ins>reports</ins> that a new born baby has <del><Vt>be</Vt></del><ins>been</ins> abandoned at hospital after <del><Wci>they</Wci></del><ins>parents</ins> realized the baby <del><ArtOrDet>have</ArtOrDet></del><ins>had</ins> diseases that need a huge amount of money to <del><Wci>secure</Wci></del><ins>treat</ins>. 
For <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> countries like Singapore, they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation. 
However, every year the government has to spend a lot to help the <del><Wform>disables</Wform></del><ins>disabled</ins> such as <del><Prep>medical</Prep></del><ins>through medical</ins> <del><Wform>subsidizes</Wform></del><ins>subsidies</ins> and <del><Vform>builds</Vform></del><ins>building</ins> <del><Rloc->up</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> special schools to educate them. 
Without <del><ArtOrDet>increasing</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an increasing</ins> number of <del><Wform>disables</Wform></del><ins>disabled people</ins> in a nation, the government is able to concentrate <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><Vform>develop</Vform></del><ins>developing</ins> in other <del><Wci>ways</Wci></del><ins>directions</ins> like <del><ArtOrDet>military</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the military</ins> and education. 
As citizens of a nation, they have <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> responsibility to support their country in many ways. 
Moreover, in the world we are <del><Prep>living</Prep></del><ins>living in</ins> today, many <del><Wci>miscarriages</Wci></del><ins>abortions</ins> <del><V0>conducted</V0></del><ins>are conducted</ins> in hospital every day. 
It is easier for people to accept it morally. 
<del><Mec>Therefore</Mec></del><ins>Therefore,</ins> I believe the parents have <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> right to <del><Prep>know</Prep></del><ins>know about</ins> the healthiness of their child. 

Many people may support <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> theory that <del><ArtOrDet>every</ArtOrDet></del><ins>all</ins> people have <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> right to enjoy the world, especially people with religions. 
However, the problem is, will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay <del><Prep>at</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> hospital <del><Mec>everyday</Mec></del><ins>every day</ins> and with all the needles and endless pain? Parents know what <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><WOinc>best is</WOinc></del><ins>is best</ins> for their children, <del><Trans>thus</Trans></del><ins>so</ins> they will make <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> right decision after they have <del><Vt>be</Vt></del><ins>been</ins> informed
Also, human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins> should improve the medical field in order to prevent <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>this</ins> tragedy <del><Vform>happen</Vform></del><ins>happening</ins>. 

I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives. 
Genetic testing is a personal choice. 
<del><Wci>One</Wci></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA person</ins> should have the full control of his/her information and it is his/her right to decide whether or not to disclose it to <del><Mec>some one</Mec></del><ins>someone</ins> else. 

<del><Rloc->As far as I am concerned, when</Rloc-></del><ins>When</ins> a couple are going to have babies, they <del><Rloc->are going to</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> run a few tests and see whether <del><Pform>their</Pform></del><ins>they</ins> could have some genetic diseases. 
The results are disclosed <del><ArtOrDet>to</ArtOrDet></del><ins>to the</ins> husbands and <del><Mec>wifes</Mec></del><ins>wives</ins>. 
This is not the case I am talking about here. 

The most obvious reason <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases. 
They have the right to know whether they are at risk. 
Also, telling them the result can <del><Wci>let</Wci></del><ins>allow</ins> <del><Prep>them </Prep></del><ins>them to</ins><del><Wci>largely</Wci></del><ins>greatly</ins> reduce the cost <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> multiple testing . 
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease. 
If <del><ArtOrDet>person</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a person</ins> has a disease C that might be a result of gene A<del><Srun>. 
He</Srun></del><ins>, he</ins> <del><Vm>runs</Vm></del><ins>can run</ins> a test and <del><Wci>know</Wci></del><ins>find out</ins> that he has the gene AA. 
This means both of his parents <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> gene A and they are both <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> high risk of having disease C. 
They could save the cost of <del><Mec>runing</Mec></del><ins>running</ins> two separate tests to see whether they are <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> high risk of having disease C. 
If he runs a test and <del><Wci>know</Wci></del><ins>finds out</ins> that he has the gene Aa<del><Srun>. 
This</Srun></del><ins>, this</ins> means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved. 
His relatives can then take measures, if this disease can <del><Mec>some how</Mec></del><ins>somehow</ins> be prevented, to stop this disease from taking their lives. 
However, this can also be achieved <del><Um>from personal choice</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
<del><Wci>One</Wci></del><ins>A person</ins> can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk. 
Most people care about their relatives, <del><Trans>if</Trans></del><ins>so, if</ins> there is no serious consequence of telling them <del><Rloc->so</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>, I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful. 
<del><Pref>One</Pref></del><ins>They</ins> might also choose to <del><Prep>hint</Prep></del><ins>hint to</ins> or encourage their <del><Rloc->certain</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that <del><SVA>comes</SVA></del><ins>come</ins> <del><Prep>across</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> when they disclose their genetic results. 

There are possible negative consequences that <del><Wci>those</Wci></del><ins>people</ins> might face if they disclose their genetic results to their <del><Nn>relative</Nn></del><ins>relatives</ins>. 
If a person is obliged to tell his/her relatives, he or she might be <del><Prep>discriminated</Prep></del><ins>discriminated against</ins> by those who do not carry this gene. 
He or she might even be <del><Mec>adviced</Mec></del><ins>advised</ins> not to get married or have children. 
For example, if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very <del><Mec>seriou</Mec></del><ins>serious</ins> disease<del><Sfrag>. 
After</Sfrag></del><ins>, after</ins> he takes the test and <del><Vt>be</Vt></del><ins>is</ins> obliged to tell his relatives, everyone <del><Vt>know</Vt></del><ins>will know</ins> that he is a carrier. 
<del><Mec>So</Mec></del><ins>So,</ins> <del><Trans>all</Trans></del><ins>if all</ins> the married couples <del><Rloc->go</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> run a test and <del><Wci>know</Wci></del><ins>find out</ins> they are not carriers<del><Sfrag>.They</Sfrag></del><ins>, they</ins> might <del><Mec>subconsiously</Mec></del><ins>subconsciously</ins> see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well. 

Third, it is hard to define relatives. 
If a gene runs in the family, <del><Trans>one</Trans></del><ins>and one</ins> of the family <del><Nn>member</Nn></del><ins>members</ins> <del><SVA>test</SVA></del><ins>tests</ins> positive, whom does he need to tell. 
If <del><Pref>that</Pref></del><ins>it</ins> is a big family, is he obliged to tell everyone? Spouses usually have very close relationships<del><Srun>, if</Srun></del><ins>
If</ins> person A <del><SVA>tell</SVA></del><ins>tells</ins> his family that he has this gene, his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he <del><Vt>needed</Vt></del><ins>needs</ins> to run a test because his <del><Wci>cousine</Wci></del><ins>nephew</ins> has this disease. 
<del><Mec>However</Mec></del><ins>However,</ins> wife D is not even <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> risk of having this disease. 
Then wife D might tell her mother, who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre. 
In less than a <del><Mec>week</Mec></del><ins>week,</ins> half of the town knows person A has a risked gene, and his family might be a genetically <del><Wci>risked</Wci></del><ins>at risk</ins> family. 
Then nobody wants to marry A, or his relatives. 
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of <del><Pref>his/her</Pref></del><ins>one's</ins> information, especially when the party that <del><Pref>he</Pref></del><ins>one</ins> is obliged to disclose <del><Pref>his</Pref></del><ins>one's</ins> information to is a potentially large group (relatives). 

In conclusion, a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives. 

<del><ArtOrDet>Carrier</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carrier</ins> of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives . 
Nowadays, people not only <del><Wform>pursuit</Wform></del><ins>pursue</ins> the comfort of their own <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins> but also <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> better development of <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>following</Wci></del><ins>future</ins> generations. 
Since the technology of modern society <del><Vt>has been</Vt></del><ins>is</ins> so advanced, it <del><Vt>becomes</Vt></del><ins>has become</ins> possible for people to make <del><ArtOrDet>decision</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a decision</ins> to take genetic <del><Nn>test</Nn></del><ins>tests</ins> so as to be clear whether or not they carry <del><ArtOrDet>genetic</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a genetic</ins> risk which <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> affect <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> next generation. 
The debatable question, an ethical dilemma, is <del><Trans>that</Trans></del><ins>whether</ins> <del><WOinc>are people</WOinc></del><ins>people are</ins> responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk<del><Mec>?</Mec></del><ins>.</ins> In my opinion, the responsibility <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Vform>telling</Vform></del><ins>tell</ins> family and relatives is quite obvious
And there are two basic reasons. 
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your <del><Wci>self-wellness</Wci></del><ins>own health</ins> and <del><ArtOrDet>health</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the health</ins> of your <del><Mec>relatives</Mec></del><ins>relatives,</ins> and the second one is being responsible for the next generations. 

<del><WOinc>The awareness of your relatives and families</WOinc></del><ins>Your relatives' awareness</ins> <del><Prep>about</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> your genetic risk is good for your <del><Wci>self-wellness</Wci></del><ins>own health</ins> and <del><ArtOrDet>health</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the health</ins> of your relatives<del><Srun>. 
Because</Srun></del><ins>, because</ins> if you are carrying that genetic risk, then there is <del><ArtOrDet>great</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a great</ins> possibility that your <del><Mec>relatives</Mec></del><ins>relatives,</ins> like parents or <del><Mec>siblings</Mec></del><ins>siblings,</ins> are carrying the same genetic risk as well. 
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger. 
If you haven't undergone <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> genetic testing, it's just <del><Um>odd and fate for</Um></del><ins></ins> what will happen to both <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> you and your relatives. 
However, if you have <del><Others>undergone</Others></del><ins>undergone tests</ins> and <del><Wci>known</Wci></del><ins>found out</ins> that you are a carrier, you are responsible for your whole family. 
Even though you cannot eliminate the risk completely, you can at least try to be alert to <del><Vform>avoiding</Vform></del><ins>avoid</ins> getting the disease. 
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected, they can go to the hospital to <del><Wci>do</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> checks regularly. 
Therefore, telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even <del><Vform>prevent</Vform></del><ins>preventing</ins> <del><Vform>to get</Vform></del><ins>getting</ins> the disease is your responsibility. 

Furthermore, you are also being responsible <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>towards</ins> your <del><Wci>next</Wci></del><ins>future</ins> generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk. 
If your wife is not aware of the truth and <del><SVA>give</SVA></del><ins>gives</ins> birth to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> baby, it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well. 
Being the parent, you are <del><V0>not</V0></del><ins>not being</ins> responsible <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>towards</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>you</ArtOrDet></del><ins>your</ins> next generations, since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> generation <del><Prep>and</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> generation and <del><Vt>being</Vt></del><ins>are</ins> aware of it. 
However, if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives, you offer a <del><Wci>chance</Wci></del><ins>choice</ins> about whether to have <del><ArtOrDet>child</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a child</ins> or not. 
And if you still decide to have the baby, since the technology has been developed <del><WOinc>so advanced</WOinc></del><ins>to such an advanced level</ins>, it might be possible in the future that the <del><Wci>application</Wci></del><ins>possibility</ins> of altering <del><Nn>gene</Nn></del><ins>genes</ins> is perfected and widely used, <del><Trans>you</Trans></del><ins>and you</ins> can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future. 
This is the responsibility of being a parent. 
And in my opinion, this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing <del><ArtOrDet>that</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> genetic testing <del><Prep>at</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the first place. 

As a conclusion, once you have undergone the genetic testing and <del><Vt>being</Vt></del><ins>are</ins> aware of carrying some specific genetic risk, there are responsibilities to your relatives, yourself, and your <del><Wci>following</Wci></del><ins>future</ins> generations <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Vform>telling</Vform></del><ins>tell</ins> your relatives and <del><Nn>families</Nn></del><ins>family</ins> the truth. 

To tell or not to <del><Mec>tell</Mec></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?</ins> 
Consider a case<del><Srun>, we</Srun></del><ins>. 
We</ins> decide to undergo genetic testing and have <del><Wci>known</Wci></del><ins>found out</ins> the result of it. 
We <del><Prep>found</Prep></del><ins>found out</ins> that we actually are <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> genetic risk carrier. 
Then it becomes <del><Wci>troublesome</Wci></del><ins>a dilemma</ins> <del><Prep>about</Prep></del><ins></ins> whether we need to tell our <del><Ssub>relatives who</Ssub></del><ins>relatives, who</ins> may carry this genetic risk as well. 
There are really a lot of things we need to consider. 
Every choice we <del><Vt>have made</Vt></del><ins>make</ins> may have a huge impact on their whole life. 
As a result, what should we do? Tell them or keep this secret until we die? 
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives <del><Trans>since</Trans></del><ins>if</ins> we really care about their health status. 
For example, diabetes is a kind of genetic disease. 
Once we <del><Vt>found</Vt></del><ins>find</ins> <del><Prep>we</Prep></del><ins>out we</ins> <del><Vt>were</Vt></del><ins>are</ins> carrying this genetic risk, it is better for us to tell our family <del><Mec>members</Mec></del><ins>members,</ins> because they may carry it as well. 
If we tell them, they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less <del><WOinc>sugar contained food</WOinc></del><ins>food containing sugar</ins> and <del><Um>keeping a good mood</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
And it is important for <del><ArtOrDet>those</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> young people. 
The earlier we tell them, <del><Um>a better habit they will arise</Um></del><ins></ins> and <del><Others>better</Others></del><ins>it will be</ins> for the rest of their lives. 
What's <del><Mec>more</Mec></del><ins>more,</ins> they may undergo genetic <del><Wform>test</Wform></del><ins>testing</ins> as well to see whether they are carrying it or <del><Mec>not</Mec></del><ins>not,</ins> which is also better for them. 

However, some people may <del><Wci>argue</Wci></del><ins>ask</ins> <del><Rloc->that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> why we want to interfere with their lives? Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this <del><Mec>news</Mec></del><ins>news,</ins> especially if they are going to <del><Wci>know</Wci></del><ins>find out</ins> that they or their descendants may have a severe disease like <del><ArtOrDet>blood</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a blood</ins> disease which is untreatable
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes <del><Trans>tells</Trans></del><ins>and tells</ins> you that actually there are some possibilities that you may <del><Wci>encounter</Wci></del><ins>contract</ins> some disease in the future<del><Srun>, what</Srun></del><ins>. 
What</ins> kind of feeling <del><Wci>are you going to</Wci></del><ins>would you</ins> have? It may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day
We become so anxious that we cannot focus on <del><Pref>everything</Pref></del><ins>anything</ins>. 
At the same time, there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not <del><Mec>correct</Mec></del><ins>correct,</ins> which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing<del><Srun>, so</Srun></del><ins>. 
So,</ins> <del><Mec>actually</Mec></del><ins>actually,</ins> we are bringing <del><WOinc>trouble to them</WOinc></del><ins>them trouble</ins>. 

<del><Mec>Personally</Mec></del><ins>Personally,</ins> I feel that we <del><WOadv>still should</WOadv></del><ins>should still</ins> <del><Wci>take</Wci></del><ins>accept</ins> our responsibility to tell them the situation. 
Since this will really affect their lives, what we should do is to try to <del><Wci>make</Wci></del><ins>do</ins> it in a positive way. 
We cannot let it go. 
We should know that although we may affect their lives, we can still let them make correct choices in the future. 
<del><Rloc->It is only</Rloc-></del><ins>Only</ins> after we tell them will they start paying attention to their health. 
They will consider whether to give <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to <del><Wci>avoid</Wci></del><ins>prevent</ins> their baby <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Vform>carry</Vform></del><ins>carrying</ins> this genetic risk as well. 
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not. 
Maybe after we tell them, they will go for it and know more about themselves. 
I know it will have a huge impact on them, but we should know that they are our loved ones<del><Srun>, we</Srun></del><ins>. 
We</ins> need to tell them and help them. 

A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to <del><Others>tell</Others></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.</ins> 
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease. 
Once the test is done, whether the results should be open to <del><Wci>his or her</Wci></del><ins>the patient's</ins> relatives has caused <del><Rloc->social</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> extensive controversy. 
Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier <del><Others>and</Others></del><ins>and that privacy</ins> should be protected. 
He or she has the right not to tell anyone. 
However, in my opinion, it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation. 
This essay will illustrate <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> two aspects. 

First of all, it can be <del><Wci>an alert </Wci></del><ins>a warning</ins><del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have. 
As we all know, genetic risk carriers are likely to <del><Prep>pass</Prep></del><ins>pass on</ins> the <del><Wform>genetics</Wform></del><ins>genes</ins> to their family members. 
Once one person in the family is found to be <del><ArtOrDet>carrying</ArtOrDet></del><ins>carrying a</ins> <del><Wci>risky </Wci></del><ins>faulty</ins><del><Wform>genetic</Wform></del><ins>gene</ins>, other members in his or her family may also have <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> risk of disease. 
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough. 
Therefore, telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble <del><Rloc->in this way</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> and save <del><Wci>much</Wci></del><ins>a lot of</ins> time for proper treatment. 
<del><Mec>Sometimes </Mec></del><ins>Sometimes,</ins><del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins> may even be saved if they are told early and <del><Wci>conduct</Wci></del><ins>undergo</ins> timely treatment. 
<del><Mec>So</Mec></del><ins>So,</ins> for the <del><Wci>consideration</Wci></del><ins>sake</ins> <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> the other family members, the relatives should be informed. 

Secondly, it can avoid genetic <del><Nn>disease </Nn></del><ins>diseases</ins><del><V0>passed</V0></del><ins>being passed</ins> to the next generation <del><Trans>when</Trans></del><ins>if</ins> they intend to have babies. 
They should let their spouse know about <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> situation before marriage. 
They need to ask for <del><ArtOrDet>doctor's</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a doctor's</ins> advice before they plan to have a baby. 
Some <del><Rloc->genetic</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>gene</Nn></del><ins>genes</ins> will pass only to boys rather than girls<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins>;</ins> some <del><Wci>are on the contrary</Wci></del><ins>vice versa</ins>. 
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse, another life may <del><Wci>have</Wci></del><ins>be</ins> <del><Prep>risk</Prep></del><ins>at risk</ins> of inheriting the genetic disease. 
I noticed a real story <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>newspaper</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a newspaper</ins> years ago. 
A couple in China <del><Vt>have</Vt></del><ins>had</ins> a son of 5 years old. 
Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was <del><Wform>diagnosis</Wform></del><ins>diagnosed</ins> <del><Prep>a</Prep></del><ins>with a</ins> kind of genetic disease which is very serious. 
They were told that the wife's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> <del><Pref>pass</Pref></del><ins>pass it</ins> only to boys rather than girls. 
<del><Mec>Therefore</Mec></del><ins>Therefore,</ins> their son <del><Vt>was inherited</Vt></del><ins>had inherited</ins> the genetic disease. 
However, the wife actually had already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband. 
The son <del><Rloc->was</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> died after one year's treatment and the couple got divorced <del><Rloc->later</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> after that. 
If the wife had not <del><Wci>hind</Wci></del><ins>hidden</ins> the truth and <del><Spar>asked</Spar></del><ins>had asked</ins> for <del><ArtOrDet>doctor's</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a doctor's</ins> advice before they <del><Vt>have</Vt></del><ins>had</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>baby</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a baby</ins>, the <del><Wform>tragic</Wform></del><ins>tragedy</ins> would not <del><Vt>happen</Vt></del><ins>have happened</ins>. 

<del><Wtone>In a nutshell</Wtone></del><ins>In summary</ins>, a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives. 
On the one hand, it can tell members of the carrier's family <del><Prep>the</Prep></del><ins>about the</ins> possible disease they may have and <del><Pref>can</Pref></del><ins>they can</ins> <del><Wci>perform</Wci></del><ins>undergo</ins> treatment in <del><Mec>time</Mec></del><ins>time,</ins> if possible. 
On the other hand, <del><WOinc>it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth</WOinc></del><ins>if the carrier hides the truth, they may pass the disease on to the next generation</ins>. 

Nowadays, with the advancement of technology, it is easy to do <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.</ins> genetic testing
We cannot deny that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face <del><Um>the disorder problem</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
However, I <del><Vt>thought</Vt></del><ins>think</ins> that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> genetic information is <del><ArtOrDet>one</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> person's personal <del><Wci>privacy</Wci></del><ins>private information</ins> which should be protected by the law. 
Therefore, I <del><Vt>thought</Vt></del><ins>think</ins> <del><Others>a</Others></del><ins>a person with a</ins> known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives. 
There are three reasons <del><Rloc->as follows</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 

Firstly, the information concerning <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>genetic</Wform></del><ins>genes</ins> is something <del><Wform>personally</Wform></del><ins>personal</ins> which is also a <del><Wci>privacy</Wci></del><ins>private matter</ins> like people's <del><Wci>bank card key</Wci></del><ins>PINs</ins>. 
Other people should not be told without the person's <del><Mec>permission</Mec></del><ins>permission,</ins> even <del><Trans>though</Trans></del><ins>if</ins> they are his or her family or relatives. 
The government should <del><Wci>set</Wci></del><ins>establish</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> law to protect this kind of privacy. 
Once people's genetic information is told to other people<del><Sfrag>. 
They</Sfrag></del><ins>, they</ins> may know the person's potential <del><Wform>disabled</Wform></del><ins>disability</ins> <del><Mec>disease</Mec></del><ins>, disease</ins> or other bad things <del><Rloc->naturally</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
They may <del><Wci>set a bias on</Wci></del><ins>discriminate against</ins> this <del><Trans>person</Trans></del><ins>person or</ins> even abandon <del><Pform>his</Pform></del><ins>him</ins> or her. 
People do not have the ability to choose their <del><Nn>gene</Nn></del><ins>genes</ins>, they should not be thought <del><Prep>badly</Prep></del><ins>badly of</ins> because of <del><ArtOrDet>bad</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a bad</ins> gene. 
So I think whatever the <del><Others>genetic</Others></del><ins>genetic risk</ins> is or whether the gene <del><Rloc->is</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><SVA>match</SVA></del><ins>matches</ins> with their parents, it should not be told to <del><Mec>anyone</Mec></del><ins>anyone, </ins> even his or her family or relatives. 

Secondly, the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family <del><Trans>even</Trans></del><ins>or even</ins> <del><Vform>broken</Vform></del><ins>break</ins> the <del><Wform>relation</Wform></del><ins>relationship</ins> between children <del><Trans>with</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> the <del><Nn>adult</Nn></del><ins>adults</ins>. 
<del><Um>Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them.</Um></del><ins></ins> However happy they were before, there would be some <del><Nn>barrier</Nn></del><ins>barriers</ins> <del><Rloc->appears</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> which will truly <del><WOadv>destroy the family gradually</WOadv></del><ins>gradually destroy the family</ins>. 
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in <del><Wci>the genetic way</Wci></del><ins>terms of genetics</ins>; it is something much deeper and tighter. 
The parents give knowledge and love to the children<del><Srun>, meanwhile</Srun></del><ins>. 
Meanwhile,</ins> they feel happy <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the <del><Mec>accompany</Mec></del><ins>company</ins> of the children. 
The children <del><Prep>rely</Prep></del><ins>rely on</ins> the parent to live. 
When they grow up, they take care of the old parents and <del><Pref>thank</Pref></del><ins>thank them</ins> for their dedication. 
The <del><Wform>relation</Wform></del><ins>relationship</ins> between parents and children is <del><Rloc->something</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> about love and dedication. 
<del><WOinc>Everyone does not want</WOinc></del><ins>No one wants</ins> to see the scene of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk. 
Therefore, I think <del><Others>a</Others></del><ins>a carrier of a</ins> known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives <del><Rloc->without the person's permission</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 

Finally, the technology of testing the <del><Nn>gene</Nn></del><ins>genes</ins> is not very mature now. 
There also exists some probability of wrong testing. 
If the wrong testing was not found by the doctor, the <del><Wci>family</Wci></del><ins>parents</ins> and the children may be sad and have a <del><Wci>struggling life</Wci></del><ins>struggle</ins> for their whole <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins>. 
<del><Mec>Therefore</Mec></del><ins>Therefore,</ins> I think <del><Others>a </Others></del><ins>a carrier of a</ins><del><Mec>know</Mec></del><ins>known</ins> genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives. 

Therefore, considering <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> people's privacy and the existence of wrong testing, for the peace of the family, I <del><Wci>support</Wci></del><ins>agree</ins> that <del><Others>a </Others></del><ins>a carrier of a</ins><del><Mec>know</Mec></del><ins>known</ins> genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives <del><Rloc->without the person's permission</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 

A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or Her Relatives . 
More and more <del><Nn>illness</Nn></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnesses</ins> <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>have been</ins> discovered to be related to <del><Rloc->some</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> genes <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>through</ins> the development of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> medical technology
People will know about whether they carry a disease <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> their genes after they have <del><Wci>done</Wci></del><ins>undergone</ins> the genetic test. 
If there is no problem, that will be wonderful. 
However, not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes. 
Therefore, once people <del><Prep>find</Prep></del><ins>find out</ins> they <del><Vt>have carried</Vt></del><ins>are carrying</ins> the disease genes, <del><WOinc>they should be responsible</WOinc></del><ins>it is their responsibility</ins> to tell their relatives, <del><Trans>at</Trans></del><ins>or at</ins> least their <del><Others>family</Others></del><ins>close family</ins> members. 

It may be awkward and <del><Wci>embarrassed</Wci></del><ins>embarrassing</ins> for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk<del><Srun>. 
But</Srun></del><ins>, but</ins> they are all from one family and <del><Wci>own</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> the same <del><Nn>forefather</Nn></del><ins>forefathers</ins>, <del><Trans>then</Trans></del><ins>so</ins> of course they <del><Wci>own</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> the same genes <del><Wci>in some part</Wci></del><ins>to some extent</ins>. 
<del><Mec>Therefore</Mec></del><ins>Therefore,</ins> there is nothing to be shy <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> or <del><Rloc->be</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> afraid of. 

If the person <del><SVA>tell</SVA></del><ins>tells</ins> their relatives that <del><Pref>he or she</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><Vt>carries</Vt></del><ins>are carrying</ins> a disease gene, <del><ArtOrDet>his or her</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their</ins> relatives can go to hospital to check whether they <del><Vt>also get</Vt></del><ins>have also got</ins> a disease gene. 
Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> <del><Vform>occur</Vform></del><ins>occurring</ins>. 
<del><WOadv>Also they can</WOadv></del><ins>They can also</ins> prevent the disease <del><Wci>going</Wci></del><ins>being passed on</ins> to their offspring. 
If the relatives <del><Vt>carry</Vt></del><ins>are carrying</ins> that disease gene, they can share the experience with him or her and give some help<del><Srun>, they</Srun></del><ins>. 
They</ins> will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue. 

If he or <del><Pform>her</Pform></del><ins>she</ins> <del><Wci>not get</Wci></del><ins>is</ins> married, he or she must tell his or her partner that he <del><Vt>carries </Vt></del><ins>is carrying</ins><del><ArtOrDet>disease</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a disease</ins> gene. 
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors. 
Or else, if he <del><Wci>holds back</Wci></del><ins>hides</ins> the genetic risk, they may have <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> unhealthy baby and <del><Pref>may</Pref></del><ins>that may</ins> cause the death of the baby or <del><ArtOrDet>end</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the end</ins> of their marriage. 

There is a story I watched on TV. 
A couple did not have a child after <del><Others>their marriage</Others></del><ins>being married</ins> for a long time, <del><Trans>their</Trans></del><ins>so their</ins> parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to <del><ArtOrDet>hospital</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the hospital</ins> to check <del><Vt>what was the problem</Vt></del><ins>what the problem was</ins>. 
After <del><Pref>came</Pref></del><ins>he came</ins> back from the hospital, the man told his parents that the problem was that he <del><Vt>carried</Vt></del><ins>was carrying</ins> a disease <del><Mec>gene</Mec></del><ins>gene,</ins> so <del><Rloc->that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> they <del><Vm>cannot</Vm></del><ins>could not</ins> have a baby <del><Rloc->in their life time</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
The woman did not know the test result, but she overheard the <del><Wci>talk</Wci></del><ins>conversation</ins> and decided to divorce <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> her husband. 
After <del><Pref>got</Pref></del><ins>he got</ins> the divorce certificate, the man showed her the test report; it <del><Wci>wrote</Wci></del><ins>said</ins> that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man. 
At that time, the woman <del><Wci>known</Wci></del><ins>realised</ins> how much her husband loved <del><Mec>her</Mec></del><ins>her,</ins> but she <del><Vt>ruined</Vt></del><ins>had ruined</ins> her happiness. 
<del><Um>Tears showed nothing.</Um></del><ins></ins> . 
People cannot avoid carrying <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> disease genes, which they <del><V0>born</V0></del><ins>are born</ins> with. 
However, they can avoid the disease genes being <del><Mec>inhered</Mec></del><ins>inherited</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> their children. 
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease <del><Mec>gene</Mec></del><ins>gene,</ins> <del><Pref>can</Pref></del><ins>they can</ins> make their family members bond <del><Wform>closely</Wform></del><ins>more closely</ins>, <del><Trans>also</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> many risks and conflicts can be avoided. 

Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to <del><Wci>predict</Wci></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentify</ins> and protect each individual at risk <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> a disorder
However, <del><Wci>there rises</Wci></del><ins>this gives rise to</ins> a family-related ethical <del><Prep>dilemma</Prep></del><ins>dilemma regarding</ins> <del><Trans>if</Trans></del><ins>whether</ins> it is right to tell a carrier's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known. 
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the <del><Nn>rights</Nn></del><ins>right</ins> to know the result. 

The answer is simply that everyone, especially our family, has the right to know the truth. 
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results, while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist, the <del><Nn>consequence</Nn></del><ins>consequences</ins> will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know. 
Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves <del><Others>and</Others></del><ins>and make</ins> emotional preparations. 
<del><Vform>Taking</Vform></del><ins>Take</ins> Angeline <del><Mec>Jolie</Mec></del><ins>Jolie,</ins> for example<del><Mec>, she</Mec></del><ins>. 
She</ins> is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing <del><Trans>on the development of</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> her breast cancer risk. 
Everything is not that bad if you know how to look <del><Prep>at</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> the bright <del><Mec>side</Mec></del><ins>side,</ins> with hope. 

People may feel angry, depressed, or even guilty about their results. 
In some cases, a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others' risk somehow. 
However, I believe it is just a <del><Wci>usual</Wci></del><ins>normal</ins> reaction to this situation. 
In addition, though it can be possible in some cases that he or she and the family can <del><Wci>undergo</Wci></del><ins>suffer</ins> specific discrimination in employment and their social life, how <del><WOinc>people can</WOinc></del><ins>can people</ins> face more dramatic <del><Nn>tragedy</Nn></del><ins>tragedies</ins> such as sickness or death if they cannot even overcome this harsh situation<del><Mec>.</Mec></del><ins>?</ins> Life is hard but people cannot blame it on <del><Pref>being</Pref></del><ins>it being</ins> unfair
It is just because <del><Rloc->that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard <del><Nn>time</Nn></del><ins>times</ins>. 

Furthermore, living with a secret is not a good <del><Wci>sensation</Wci></del><ins>feeling</ins>, especially if the situations of other relatives become worse<del><Mec>, you</Mec></del><ins>. 
You</ins> <del><Vm>should</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> feel guilty and depressed. 
Moreover, the truth cannot be hidden forever but when it is revealed, <del><WOinc>more shocking and upset it will be</WOinc></del><ins>it will be more shocking and upsetting</ins>. 
As <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> result, it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives, <del><Mec>telling</Mec></del><ins>so telling</ins> the genetic testing result is <del><Wci>needed</Wci></del><ins>necessary</ins>. 

Last but not least, though genetic testing is a personal matter, telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> each <del><Mec>other</Mec></del><ins>other,</ins> as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone's health. 
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society and <del><Pref>anxiety</Pref></del><ins>their anxiety</ins> about the risks. 

<del><Wtone>To put it in the nutshell</Wtone></del><ins>In summary</ins>, I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health. 
It <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> be very difficult for <del><Mec>them</Mec></del><ins>them,</ins> but necessary for the carriers and their family. 
In addition, emotional preparations and the ways you explain your genetic condition <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives <del><Mec>and</Mec></del><ins>and,</ins> if <del><Mec>necessary</Mec></del><ins>necessary,</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> guide them if <del><Pref>he/she</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> wish to conduct <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> similar genetic testing. 

The Impact Of Social Media 
Social media <del><Vt>has been playing</Vt></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplay</ins> a <del><Wform>vital</Wform></del><ins>vitally</ins> important role in our lives today
It is almost <del><Mec>imposible</Mec></del><ins>impossible</ins> for us to keep <del><Wci>way</Wci></del><ins>away</ins> from it. 
I started <del><Wci>invoving</Wci></del><ins>using</ins> <del><Prep>into</Prep></del><ins></ins> Facebook one <del><Nn>years</Nn></del><ins>year</ins> ago,when I <del><Vt>just arrived</Vt></del><ins>had just arrived</ins> <del><Prep>singapore</Prep></del><ins>in Singapore</ins>. 
And now I <del><Wci>got</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> over 500 friends on Facebook <del><Um>and buried myself with hundrends of seeds every day</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
We know each others' status, <del><Wci>changements</Wci></del><ins>changes</ins> and so on through <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media. 
For <del><ArtOrDet>an</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> example, if we change our contact numbers, we will not send <del><ArtOrDet>SMS</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an SMS</ins> to <del><Pref>each </Pref></del><ins>each other</ins><del><Wform>of individual</Wform></del><ins>individually</ins> any <del><Wci>longer</Wci></del><ins>more</ins>.

In certain <del><Wci>aspects</Wci></del><ins>respects</ins>, social media <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> brought us quite a lot of convenience. 
It is becoming even more <del><Mec>convinient</Mec></del><ins>convenient</ins> than talking <del><Prep>throught</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> the <del><Mec>phone</Mec></del><ins>phone,</ins> since it is free.

And also, we get a chance to talk to public <del><Wci>people</Wci></del><ins>figures</ins> like <del><Wci>popular stars</Wci></del><ins>celebrities</ins> and know their life better. 
In China, a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people, like firefighters, police stations and so on.

Besides, there are more people <del><Mec>shwing</Mec></del><ins>showing</ins> their pictures of yummy food or travelling <del><Nn>experience</Nn></del><ins>experiences</ins>.

The burgeoning <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> social media definitely has its <del><Um>stint</Um></del><ins></ins><del><Mec>;</Mec></del><ins>,</ins> <del><Mec>but </Mec></del><ins>but,</ins><del><Prep>amongst</Prep></del><ins>like</ins> all good things, it is better to have <del><Npos>them</Npos></del><ins>it</ins> in moderation. 

Convenience and efficiency are two very important <del><Wci>use</Wci></del><ins>aspects</ins> of social media. 
While millions of users are <del><Vt>connect</Vt></del><ins>connected</ins> at any one time, any information can be readily available <del><Prep>at</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> their perusal. 
This improves the connectivity between the users. 
For <del><ArtOrDet>an</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> example, one is able to send notifications and other information we <del><Vt>use</Vt></del><ins>used</ins> to have <del><Pref>them</Pref></del><ins></ins> in hardcopy <del><Rloc->previously,</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> over the <del><Mec>web</Mec></del><ins>web,</ins> and the process takes seconds. 
The <del><Mec>receipent,will</Mec></del><ins>recipient will</ins> then receive the information almost <del><Mec>immediately</Mec></del><ins>immediately,</ins> depending on the quality of the network. 
This <del><Mec>covenience</Mec></del><ins>convenience</ins> can be <del><Mec>percieved </Mec></del><ins>perceived</ins><del><Rloc->as</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> almost in <del><Mec>realtime</Mec></del><ins>real time</ins>. 

Next, communication <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> also greatly improved. 
In the past, <del><Um>vast</Um></del><ins></ins> communication <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> done by one of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Others>many</Others></del><ins>many means,</ins> such <del><Mec>a</Mec></del><ins>as</ins> telegram, snail mail and poor-quality voice calls. 
With the <del><Wci>welcoming</Wci></del><ins>advent</ins> of <del><Nn>application</Nn></del><ins>applications</ins> such as Skype and Facetime, any individual can phase <del><Wci>off</Wci></del><ins>out</ins> most<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> of the <del><Wci>olden days</Wci></del><ins>old</ins> communication methods. 
Aside from hearing the voice, a <del><Wform>webcamera </Wform></del><ins>webcam</ins><del><Vm>could</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> also be affixed to emulate <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> 'real' interaction with expressions and gestures. 
Communication would have <del><Vt>took</Vt></del><ins>taken</ins> a different turn without the <del><Wci>easily</Wci></del><ins>readily</ins> available social media. 

However, it is <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> good practice not to <del><Mec>intesively</Mec></del><ins>intensively</ins> use social media all the time. 
Intimate interaction <del><Vt>greatly lack</Vt></del><ins>is greatly lacking</ins> in social media interactions, particularly <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> touch. 
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the <del><Mec>recepient</Mec></del><ins>recipient</ins>. 
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which <del><Mec>utlises</Mec></del><ins>utilises</ins> the motor, thinking and verbal cortex of the mind to <del><Others>coordinate</Others></del><ins></ins>. 
Unlike <del><Rloc->the use of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> social media, <del><Pref>most</Pref></del><ins>where most</ins> of the interaction is done <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> thinking and typing. 
As a result, one does not <del><Wci>train</Wci></del><ins>practise</ins> the <del><Wform>necessarily</Wform></del><ins>necessary</ins> <del><Rloc->parts of the</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> skills required for <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> proper interpersonal relations. 

It is also <del><Wform>entire</Wform></del><ins>entirely</ins> <del><Wci>incorrect</Wci></del><ins>wrong</ins> to <del><Wci>fault</Wci></del><ins>blame</ins> social media alone for the lack of interpersonal <del><Nn>skill</Nn></del><ins>skills</ins>. 
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences <del><Prep>amongst</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a <del><Wci>form</Wci></del><ins>type</ins> of <del><Nn>skills</Nn></del><ins>skill</ins> on its own - some <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> it, some <del><SVA>does</SVA></del><ins>do</ins> not. 
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted, <del><Rloc->in accordance of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> utilising tests, and ranked. 
Fundamentally, those who scored lower <del><Rloc->ranking</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed. 

Though social media need not be necessarily bad, it must be used <del><Wci>accordingly</Wci></del><ins>appropriately</ins> - for work, family, friends. 
The types of use must also be taken note of - informing, interacting, discussion and others. 
The <del><Wci>space of separation</Wci></del><ins>distance</ins> between the parties must also be looked at. 
For people who are living very far from one another, the intensive <del><Prep>use</Prep></del><ins>use of</ins> social media is justified. 
<del><Prep>For those</Prep></del><ins>Those</ins> who <del><SVA>lives</SVA></del><ins>live</ins> within the community should at least meet up, and not use social media as the primary <del><Wci>source</Wci></del><ins>means</ins> of <del><Mec>communcation</Mec></del><ins>communication</ins> with each other. 
And at the same time, <del><Pref>improves</Pref></del><ins>this improves</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> interpersonal <del><Nn>skill</Nn></del><ins>skills</ins>, through dynamic <del><Mec>practises</Mec></del><ins>practices</ins> <del><Mec>betwwen</Mec></del><ins>between</ins> individuals and realtime presence. 
The inclusion of <del><Wci>intimate presence</Wci></del><ins>close proximity</ins> and <del><Um>relative</Um></del><ins></ins> touch could also <del><Wci>bring</Wci></del><ins>lead to</ins> a better rapport between those interacting. 

Recently, the rise of social media <del><Vt>helped</Vt></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helped</ins> people to <del><ArtOrDet>have</ArtOrDet></del><ins>have a</ins> <del><Wform>more closer</Wform></del><ins>closer</ins> connection with each other<del><Mec>, it</Mec></del><ins>
It</ins> is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with <del><Mec>face to face</Mec></del><ins>face-to-face</ins> meetings. 
In my opinion, social media <del><Mec>websides</Mec></del><ins>websites</ins> such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have <del><Mec>face to face</Mec></del><ins>face-to-face</ins> contact and thus negatively <del><Vform>affects</Vform></del><ins>affect</ins> interpersonal skills. 
<del><Rloc->On the other hand, it</Rloc-></del><ins>It</ins> may even increase the chance of having <del><Mec>face to face</Mec></del><ins>face-to-face</ins> <del><Nn>contacts</Nn></del><ins>contact</ins> <del><Prep>amoung</Prep></del><ins>between</ins> people. 

First, social media networks have a <del><Wci>lot</Wci></del><ins>large</ins> user base<del><Srun>, </Srun></del><ins>, and</ins><del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><SVA>helps</SVA></del><ins>help</ins> to link people from different parts of the world. 
In the days <del><Prep>without</Prep></del><ins>before</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social networks, people <del><Wci>may</Wci></del><ins>did</ins> not have the chance to know others from different countries or <del><Wci>the ones</Wci></del><ins>people</ins> they <del><Vt>never meet</Vt></del><ins>had never met</ins> before. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The</ins> number of people that they <del><Vt>know </Vt></del><ins>knew</ins><del><Wci>may</Wci></del><ins>was</ins> only limited to the people they <del><Vt>meet</Vt></del><ins>met</ins> in daily <del><Mec>life</Mec></del><ins>life,</ins> like classmates and <del><Wci>working partners</Wci></del><ins>colleagues</ins>. 
Therefore, social networks <del><SVA>brings</SVA></del><ins>bring</ins> more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never <del><Vt>known</Vt></del><ins>knew</ins> before, and this helps to develop <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> interpersonal skills as well. 

Secondly, although social <del><Nn>network</Nn></del><ins>networks</ins> <del><SVA>takes</SVA></del><ins>take</ins> time for people to chat online but not face to face, they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> daily life. 
In this case, the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk. 
For example, <del><ArtOrDet>if</ArtOrDet></del><ins>if a</ins> social network does not exist, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> business people need to meet each other face to face and it is <del><Rloc->other</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> time consuming<del><Srun>, even</Srun></del><ins>. 
Even</ins> sometimes with business that is not so important, it still <del><Wci>takes</Wci></del><ins>requires</ins> a <del><Prep>lot</Prep></del><ins>lot of</ins> time <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><Mec>travel</Mec></del><ins>travel,</ins> which is a <del><Wci>wastage</Wci></del><ins>waste</ins>. 
However, social <del><Nn>network</Nn></del><ins>networks</ins> <del><SVA>helps</SVA></del><ins>help</ins> people to meet and chat much more <del><Wform>easier</Wform></del><ins>easily</ins><del><Srun>, they</Srun></del><ins>. 
They</ins> can even use video chat and <del><ArtOrDet>create</ArtOrDet></del><ins>create a</ins> group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time. 
Nowadays, <del><WOadv>even some companies</WOadv></del><ins>some companies even</ins> conduct online video <del><Nn>interview</Nn></del><ins>interviews</ins> with their <del><Mec>applicants</Mec></del><ins>applicants,</ins> as it saves time and <del><Wci>cost</Wci></del><ins>money</ins>. 

The social network may also <del><Wci>creat</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> some negative impacts for <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> people. 
The <del><Wci>largest</Wci></del><ins>biggest</ins> negative impact is <del><Mec>that</Mec></del><ins>that,</ins> due to the online network, some people start to use and rely <del><ArtOrDet>on</ArtOrDet></del><ins>on the</ins> internet <del><Wci>every minute</Wci></del><ins>all the time</ins>. 
They <del><Wci>take</Wci></del><ins>spend</ins> too much time <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> using online social <del><Wform>network</Wform></del><ins>networks</ins> and thus do not have time to have their daily meeting with people in their real life. 
It not only <del><SVA>affect</SVA></del><ins>affects</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> interpersonal skills but <del><V0>also</V0></del><ins>also is</ins> bad for people's health if <del><Pref>the ones</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> spend <del><Mec>to</Mec></del><ins>too</ins> much time on <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media. 
Secondly, social <del><Nn>network</Nn></del><ins>networks</ins> may leak certain personal <del><Nn>informations</Nn></del><ins>information</ins> to the public<del><Srun>, as</Srun></del><ins>. 
As</ins> the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe, people may not protect their privacy online effectively <del><Mec>and</Mec></del><ins>and,</ins> sometimes, some people may use <del><Mec>others</Mec></del><ins>others'</ins> personal information to deceive. 

In conclusion, although the unsafe online environment<del><Trans>,</Trans></del><ins> and</ins> <del><Vform>spend</Vform></del><ins>spending</ins> too much time <del><ArtOrDet>on</ArtOrDet></del><ins>on the</ins> internet may be <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> potential negative <del><Wci>factors</Wci></del><ins>aspects</ins> of using online social networks<del><Mec>. 
It</Mec></del><ins>, it</ins> provides people with more convenient contact <del><Rloc->environment</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> and <del><SVA>improve</SVA></del><ins>improves</ins> the frequency of meeting with <del><Rloc->each</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> others. 
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online <del><Mec>chating</Mec></del><ins>chatting</ins>. 
Overall, there are more benefits than <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>costs</Wci></del><ins>disadvantages</ins>. 

The <del><Mec>wolrd</Mec></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworld</ins> is <del><Mec>incresingly</Mec></del><ins>increasingly</ins> becoming flat <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>as a result of</ins> all kinds of social network <del><Nn>website</Nn></del><ins>websites</ins> such as <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> and <del><Mec>twitter</Mec></del><ins>Twitter</ins>
We can even know what a friend who <del><Wci>leave</Wci></del><ins>lives</ins> thousands of miles away <del><Vt>eat</Vt></del><ins>ate</ins> for lunch <del><Mec>though</Mec></del><ins>through</ins> these kinds of social media. 
From some points of view, <del><Others>social</Others></del><ins>social media</ins> really <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> a lot of advantages by <del><Vform>let</Vform></del><ins>letting</ins> us communicate with friends <del><Wform>cheaper</Wform></del><ins>more cheaply</ins> and more conveniently. 
However, <del><Pref>its</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> disadvantages also cannot be <del><Mec>ingnored</Mec></del><ins>ignored</ins> when you <del><Mec>cosider</Mec></del><ins>consider</ins> <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime. 

Social network sites <del><SVA>provides</SVA></del><ins>provide</ins> <del><Prep>us</Prep></del><ins>us with</ins> <del><Wci>many</Wci></del><ins>a great deal of</ins> convenience. 
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends <del><Prep>through</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>phone</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the phone</ins>, we can know <del><Pref>his of her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> latest news by <del><Mec>scaning</Mec></del><ins>scanning</ins> the webpage. 
<del><Pref>It</Pref></del><ins>They</ins> can help us know more about each other. 
<del><Pref>It</Pref></del><ins>They</ins> can make people become closer as well. 
For example, if you find out one of your friend's favourite <del><Nn>singer</Nn></del><ins>singers</ins> is Justin Biber through <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins>, you can give him or her Justin Biber's new album <del><ArtOrDet>or</ArtOrDet></del><ins>or a</ins> concert ticket as a birthday gift. 
It will be really <del><Wci>sweet</Wci></del><ins></ins> and you two will <del><Mec>surelly</Mec></del><ins>surely</ins> become closer. 
In addition, social network <del><Nn>site</Nn></del><ins>sites</ins> can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away. 
I met some <del><Mec>canadian</Mec></del><ins>Canadian</ins> friends in Egypt. 
Without <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins>, we <del><V0>may</V0></del><ins>might</ins> <del><Vt>lost</Vt></del><ins>have lost</ins> contact. 
However, thanks to <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins>, I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>have been</ins> doing <del><Rloc->recently</Rloc-></del><ins>recently,</ins> as we <del><Vform>living</Vform></del><ins>live</ins> close to each other. 

The disadvantages of social <del><Rloc->network</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> media are quite undeniable. 
<del><SVA>A research</SVA></del><ins>Research</ins> shows that people will unconsciously hide <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> real <del><Nn>thought</Nn></del><ins>thoughts</ins> when <del><Pref>he or her</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> say or post something that will be exposed to the public. 
It means that one cannot know another's real <del><Nn>thought</Nn></del><ins>thoughts</ins> and <del><Nn>personalities</Nn></del><ins>personality</ins> by reading things that <del><Pref>he or she</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> put on social <del><Rloc->network</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> media. 
It will make <del><Pref>him or her</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> quite upset when they communicate in real life. 
In addition, with all those "nice" guys around on the social network <del><Rloc->website</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>, one may neglect people surrounding <del><Pref>him or her</Pref></del><ins>one</ins> <del><Trans>but</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> just communicate with friends on <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins>. 
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other but just look at their <del><Nn>cellphone</Nn></del><ins>cellphones</ins>. 
This kind of behaviour is not good <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> people's psychological <del><Mec>health</Mec></del><ins>health,</ins> according to <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> research. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The cyber</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Cyber</ins> communication is quite different to <del><Mec>face to face</Mec></del><ins>face-to-face</ins> <del><Mec>communication</Mec></del><ins>communication,</ins> and people who <del><SVA>depends</SVA></del><ins>depend</ins> on cyber communication too much will not get used to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>real life</Mec></del><ins>real-life</ins> communication. 
In addition, cyber <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> cannot always work in real life. 
With no close <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> in real life but only close cyber friends, one is more <del><Wci>possibly</Wci></del><ins>likely</ins> to feel lonely because <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>through</ins> our five senses. 
With the <del><Wci>willing</Wci></del><ins>desire</ins> of people to become the best among others, social network <del><Nn>site</Nn></del><ins>sites</ins> <del><Vt>now become</Vt></del><ins>have now become</ins> a place to show off. 
Some people will <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> post their expensive thing or the <del><Mec>oversea</Mec></del><ins>overseas</ins> places of interest they have <del><Prep>been</Prep></del><ins>been to</ins> on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so. 
It is a mental <del><Wci>unhealth</Wci></del><ins>illness</ins> and it may <del><Wci>trigger</Wci></del><ins>cause</ins> <del><Mec>people</Mec></del><ins>people,</ins> especially <del><Mec>teenagers</Mec></del><ins>teenagers,</ins> to become <del><Wform>material</Wform></del><ins>materialistic</ins>. 
<del><Wci>The last but not the least ,</Wci></del><ins>Last but not least,</ins> with all kinds of personal information on one's social network page, it is <del><Mec>covenient</Mec></del><ins>convenient</ins> for <del><Nn>criminal</Nn></del><ins>criminals</ins> to make use of this information to commit a crime. 

Above all, <del><ArtOrDet>social</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a social</ins> network site is like a <del><Wci>two sided knife</Wci></del><ins>double-edged sword</ins> and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it <del><Prep>such as</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> <del><Vform>put</Vform></del><ins>putting</ins> less personal information on <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> page. 

The modes of communication have been changing over the years, from letter writing to social networking. 
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology, which has made communication <del><Rloc->to be</Rloc-></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworld</ins> faster than <del><Wci>never</Wci></del><ins>ever</ins> before
Today, social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, are relatively common within <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> contemporary society<del><Mec>;</Mec></del><ins>,</ins> and, people can communicate with each other, online or offline, on these social networking platforms. 
They can even make new friends <del><Prep>over</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> similar interests on these platforms, which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world. 
However, critics may argue that <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> the existence of social media sites <del><SVA>have</SVA></del><ins>has</ins> reduced physical human interactions <del><Prep>among</Prep></del><ins>between</ins> people as they <del><Vt>will prefer</Vt></del><ins>prefer</ins> sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends. 
This essay will discuss <del><Prep>about</Prep></del><ins></ins> both the benefits and <del><Mec>down sides</Mec></del><ins>downsides</ins> of using social media in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> contemporary society. 

Nowadays, social media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media. 
<del><Rloc->There are about</Rloc-></del><ins>About</ins> 50% of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> people <del><Rloc->who</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Vt>have learnt</Vt></del><ins>learn</ins> about breaking news from social media. 
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than <del><Rloc->time</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> on reading <del><Mec>newpapers</Mec></del><ins>newspapers</ins>. 
Furthermore, with the current technology, smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have <del><Vt>made</Vt></del><ins>been made</ins> easier for consumers to use. 
Hence, social media <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost <del><Wform>immediate</Wform></del><ins>immediately</ins> to the people around them. 

However, critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> reliable. 
There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media. 
For example, in 2012, there were false rumors of fires, shootouts, and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook. 
This <del><Vt>had caused</Vt></del><ins>caused</ins> panic among the <del><Mec>people</Mec></del><ins>people,</ins> who <del><Vt>had flooded</Vt></del><ins>flooded</ins> the local police department with <del><Rloc->numerous</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> phone calls, and this <del><Vt>had resulted</Vt></del><ins>resulted</ins> <del><Prep>temporarily</Prep></del><ins>in temporarily</ins> closed <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> schools. 
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone, given that social media can disseminate information <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> a <del><Mec>realtively</Mec></del><ins>relatively</ins> fast speed. 
Nevertheless, there are cyber <del><Nn>polices</Nn></del><ins>police</ins> who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading <del><Rloc->around</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
But, there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media <del><Mec>sites</Mec></del><ins>sites,</ins> despite high security to control almost every social networking movement. 

Social media are able to improve <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> and <del><Others>make</Others></del><ins>help us to make</ins> new friends, provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties. 
Many of the teenagers today <del><Vt>claimed</Vt></del><ins>claim</ins> that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media, regardless of their location. 
In the past, people used to <del><Vform>writing</Vform></del><ins>write</ins> letters to their friends and it <del><Vm>will</Vm></del><ins>would</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>take</ArtOrDet></del><ins>take a</ins> relatively long time <del><WOinc>to send the letter over</WOinc></del><ins>for the letter to arrive</ins>. 
Therefore, with the help of technology, people are able to catch up <del><Mec>wth</Mec></del><ins>with</ins> each other conveniently. 
Furthermore, it will be easier to make new friends <del><Rloc->find</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> who have <del><Mec>simliar</Mec></del><ins>similar</ins> interests or hobbies. 
However, in order for people to maintain their <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> as well as <del><Vform>making</Vform></del><ins>make</ins> new friends, it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties. 
It might not be accurate to judge the other party's feelings over social media as <del><Pref>one</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> may cover up their emotions while on social media. 
In addition, there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they cannot sense the tone of the other party <del><Prep>over</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> social media platforms. 
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication. 
But, if there is trust and mutual <del><Wform>understand</Wform></del><ins>understanding</ins> on social media, it will be ideal for people to improve <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> and make new friends. 

In conclusion, social media in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> contemporary society <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> able to help one improve <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> and make new friends, as well as<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> disseminate information efficiently to the masses. 
However, there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication. 
Nevertheless, the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects <del><Rloc->of it</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> can be carefully taken care of. 
All-in-all, social media <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> the product of rapid technological advancement and there are more to come <del><ArtOrDet>in</ArtOrDet></del><ins>in the</ins> future. 

Advantages: Social media sites have greatly <del><Wci>ease</Wci></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitated</ins> long distance communication and interaction due to <del><Pref>its</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> accessibility and convenience
With a globalised and interconnected world today, Twitter and Facebook are now the <del><Wci>mainstream</Wci></del><ins>main</ins> <del><SVA>platform</SVA></del><ins>platforms</ins> for social interaction. 
With <del><Rloc->just a touch away from</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> any <del><Mec>meida</Mec></del><ins>media</ins>/electronic devices, one can easily interact and communicate with <del><Pref>his</Pref></del><ins>one's</ins> friends without much hassle. 
Thus, long distance <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> or <del><Nn>friendship</Nn></del><ins>friendships</ins> can be <del><Vt>maintain</Vt></del><ins>maintained</ins> and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier. 
<del><Prep>With the</Prep></del><ins>The</ins> sharing of personal photos, posting of status <del><Mec>of</Mec></del><ins>or</ins> one's personal <del><Nn>feeling</Nn></del><ins>feelings</ins> or experience and <del><Wform>able</Wform></del><ins>the ability</ins> to reply to these posts <del><Vt>allowed</Vt></del><ins>have allowed</ins> human interaction to <del><Um>be engage</Um></del><ins></ins> and expand with ease. 
<del><Mec>Introverts</Mec></del><ins>Introverts,</ins> or those who are shy <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> <del><Vform>communicate</Vform></del><ins>communicating</ins> with their <del><Mec>friends</Mec></del><ins>friends,</ins> are now able to do so in the form of words via social media <del><Nn>platform</Nn></del><ins>platforms</ins>. 
Thus, <del><Wform>socialisation</Wform></del><ins>socialising</ins> can occur seamlessly and effectively with the <del><Wform>utilisation</Wform></del><ins>use</ins> of such social media platforms.Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another, making human interaction possible at one's own convenience. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The society</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Society</ins> will adapt to such <del><Nn>phenomenon</Nn></del><ins>phenomena</ins> as physical interaction <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> transformed into cyber interaction. 
With the frequent <del><Wform>usage</Wform></del><ins>use</ins> and reliance <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media and the Internet, a society that socialises through the <del><Wci>cyber</Wci></del><ins>Internet</ins> will be more <del><Wform>advance</Wform></del><ins>advanced</ins> and adapted to the highly connected world. 
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly. 

Disadvantages: One of the main concerns of using social media <del><Rloc->platform</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> to communicate is <del><Wform>credibility</Wform></del><ins>trust</ins>. 
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed <del><V0>could not</V0></del><ins>cannot</ins> be proven physically as media <del><SVA>limits</SVA></del><ins>limit</ins> this physical interaction, except when using a webcam to chat. 
We cannot be <del><Prep>certain </Prep></del><ins>certain of</ins><del><Rloc->for sure</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we <del><Vt>received</Vt></del><ins>receive</ins> through the <del><Mec>Inetrnet</Mec></del><ins>Internet</ins>. 
We may in actual fact <del><V0>communicating</V0></del><ins>be communicating</ins> with a <del><Wci>hoax</Wci></del><ins>fake</ins> Facebook <del><Mec>acccount</Mec></del><ins>account</ins> of <del><Wci>a cyber</Wci></del><ins>an online</ins> friend, which we assume to be real <del><Mec>but</Mec></del><ins>but,</ins> in reality, it is a fake account. 
Photos and <del><Nn>informations</Nn></del><ins>information</ins> retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit <del><ArtOrDet>certain</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> personal agenda. 
Thus, the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media. 
Although <del><Mec>emocons</Mec></del><ins>emoticons</ins> can be used to show certain <del><Nn>emotion</Nn></del><ins>emotions</ins>, this differs from the <del><Rloc->real authentic</Rloc-></del><ins>real</ins> emotion of your friends when you <del><Vt>observed</Vt></del><ins>observe</ins> them through their body language and their facial expression. 
The danger of such <del><Wci>media </Wci></del><ins>online</ins><del><Wform>socialisation</Wform></del><ins>socialising</ins> is the uncertainty of such communication due <del><ArtOrDet>to</ArtOrDet></del><ins>to the</ins> lack of physical interaction. 
Furthermore, this lack of physical interaction has affected human <del><Mec>inter-personal</Mec></del><ins>interpersonal</ins> <del><Mec>behaviour</Mec></del><ins>behaviour, </ins> since communication is <del><Wci>made</Wci></del><ins>conducted</ins> through social media instead of <del><Wform>meet-ups</Wform></del><ins>meetings</ins>. 
This lowers the <del><Rloc->experience of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> human ability to interact with one <del><Mec>another</Mec></del><ins>another,</ins> which can adversely shape one's behaviour. 
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Vt>not create</Vt></del><ins>will not create</ins> the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others. 
Therefore, for an effective and efficient society, there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction <del><Rloc->within its people</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 

Nowadays, people can even use their phone to read <del><ArtOrDet>news</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe news</ins> and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world
People use Twitter to follow the artiste or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what <del><WOinc>is their friends' recent activity</WOinc></del><ins>their friends' recent activity is</ins>. 
Nevertheless, they <del><WOadv>still can</WOadv></del><ins>can still</ins> use <del><ArtOrDet>phone</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a phone</ins> to <del><Wci>do</Wci></del><ins>make</ins> normal <del><Nn>call</Nn></del><ins>calls</ins> <del><V0>and</V0></del><ins>and send</ins> <del><Nn>message</Nn></del><ins>messages</ins> to <del><Others>contact</Others></del><ins>contact people</ins>. 
<del><WOinc>Not only the phone</WOinc></del><ins>It is not only the phone that</ins> <del><Vt>did</Vt></del><ins>does</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> jobs for them, but also devices like personal <del><Nn>computer</Nn></del><ins>computers</ins>, <del><Nn>laptop</Nn></del><ins>laptops</ins>, <del><Nn>tablet</Nn></del><ins>tablets</ins>, and many other devices which are able to connect to <del><ArtOrDet>internet</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the Internet</ins>. 
It is obvious <del><Rloc->to see</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> that <del><ArtOrDet>internet</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the Internet</ins> saves people's time and also <del><Spar>connect</Spar></del><ins>connects</ins> people globally. 
Several arguments have been made <del><Trans>regarding</Trans></del><ins>regarding whether</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> people. 

People can only use <del><Mec>electical</Mec></del><ins>electrical</ins> devices to access <del><ArtOrDet>internet</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the Internet</ins>. 
Whenever they need to use social media, they have to use a phone or <del><Wci>internet</Wci></del><ins>other device</ins>. 
<del><Mec>Generally</Mec></del><ins>Generally,</ins> people need <del><Pform>they</Pform></del><ins>their</ins> eyes to look at the <del><Rloc->display screen</Rloc-></del><ins>screen</ins> of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the <del><Wci>corresponding</Wci></del><ins>relevant</ins> device. 
As a result, they will <del><Wci>lose</Wci></del><ins>not have</ins> eyes to <del><Wci>contact</Wci></del><ins>make contact with</ins> and hands to express their <del><Nn>feeling</Nn></del><ins>feelings</ins> to people nearby <del><Pref>them</Pref></del><ins></ins>, which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face <del><Rloc->contact</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>communicating</Wform></del><ins>communication</ins>. 
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays. 
A family of four having <del><Nn>dinners</Nn></del><ins>dinner</ins> in a restaurant without any chatting, because <del><Mec>their</Mec></del><ins>they're</ins> holding and looking at their <del><Rloc->display screen</Rloc-></del><ins>screen</ins> with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork. 
A group of friends having high tea in a cafÃ© without chatting as well, because they do not know what to<del><Prep> tal</Prep></del><ins>talk about</ins>k<del><Prep> bu</Prep></del><ins>without</ins>t<del><Wci> pressin</Wci></del><ins>clicking</ins>g on their<del><Rloc-> display scree</Rloc-></del><ins>screen</ins>n.<del><ArtOrDet> The childre</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Children</ins>n nowadays do not know<del><WOinc> what is neighbourhood game</WOinc></del><ins>what neighbourhood games are</ins>s and who is<del><Rloc-> stayin</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>g beside the<del><Mec>m</Mec></del><ins>;</ins>, all they know is<del><Wci> pressin</Wci></del><ins>clicking on</ins>g icons on<del><ArtOrDet> th</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins>e screens. 
These are some concrete examples of how<del><ArtOrDet> th</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins>e<del><Mec> soci</Mec></del><ins>social</ins>a media reduce face-to-face human contact. 

When people get <del><Wform>use</Wform></del><ins>used</ins> <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> using <del><Mec>socia</Mec></del><ins>social</ins> media to contact other people, what will happen is that their interpersonal <del><Wform>communicating</Wform></del><ins>communication</ins> skills will <del><Vt>degrade</Vt></del><ins>be degraded</ins> and lost eventually. 
Firstly, they have lost the courage to meet strangers, <del><Wci>not even</Wci></del><ins>let alone</ins> the courage to talk. 
Also, they will not have enough experience to communicate with people <del><Wci>in face</Wci></del><ins>face to face</ins> and <del><Spar>not be</Spar></del><ins>will not be</ins> trained in <del><Pref>their</Pref></del><ins></ins> conversation skills. 
As a result, social media <del><SVA>helps</SVA></del><ins>help</ins> them do <del><Pref>the</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> jobs but indirectly <del><SVA>affects</SVA></del><ins>affect</ins> their interpersonal skills. 

Social media <del><SVA>does</SVA></del><ins>do</ins> have some other advantages <del><Prep>beside</Prep></del><ins>besides</ins> their general benefits to human <del><Nn>being</Nn></del><ins>beings</ins>. 
First of all, people <del><SVA>saves</SVA></del><ins>save</ins> money by using <del><ArtOrDet>internet</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the Internet</ins> to contact other people and <del><Spar>reading</Spar></del><ins>read</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>news</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the news</ins>. 
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in <del><ArtOrDet>other</ArtOrDet></del><ins>another</ins> country via <del><Mec>socia</Mec></del><ins>social</ins> media software instead of making <del><ArtOrDet>international</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an international</ins> call which costs a lot <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><WOinc>normal salary family</WOinc></del><ins>a family on a normal salary</ins>. 
He can even talk to <del><Pform>her</Pform></del><ins>his</ins> daughter face-to-face using video <del><Nn>call</Nn></del><ins>calls</ins> via <del><ArtOrDet>internet</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the Internet</ins>. 
Secondly, people <del><SVA>makes</SVA></del><ins>make</ins> friends all over the world and <del><V0>able</V0></del><ins>are able</ins> to update their <del><Prep>friends</Prep></del><ins>friends on</ins> <del><Pref>his</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> recent activity easily. 
A <del><Wtone>guy</Wtone></del><ins>man</ins> who is going <del><Vform>travel</Vform></del><ins>travelling</ins> for months can easily tell all of his friends about his <del><Nn>activity</Nn></del><ins>activities</ins>. 
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls, he might be able to get his <del><Nn>whereabout</Nn></del><ins>whereabouts</ins> using social media. 
These are the advantages that save <del><Nn>works</Nn></del><ins>work</ins> most of the time. 

In <del><Wform>conclude</Wform></del><ins>conclusion</ins>, <del><Mec>socia</Mec></del><ins>social</ins> media <del><SVA>benefits</SVA></del><ins>benefit</ins> people in several <del><Mec>ways</Mec></del><ins>ways,</ins> but <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> the same time <del><SVA>harms</SVA></del><ins>harm</ins> people. 
People should avoid the misuse of <del><Mec>socia</Mec></del><ins>social</ins> media and use it in the proper way. 
With the <del><Nn>aids</Nn></del><ins>aid</ins> of social media, people <del><SVA>bonds</SVA></del><ins>bond</ins> globally, information flows rapidly, and human lives <del><V0>happily</V0></del><ins>proceed happily</ins>. 

All of us are living in <del><Um>the technology realm society</Um></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe news</ins>
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect <del><Pref>ourselves</Pref></del><ins></ins> with other people? It started <del><Mec>withthe</Mec></del><ins>with the</ins> invention of <del><Mec>technology</Mec></del><ins>technology,</ins> which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades
In the past, we <del><Vt>travel</Vt></del><ins>travelled</ins> by <del><Rloc->ship</Rloc-></del><ins>ship,</ins> and <del><Mec>now</Mec></del><ins>now,</ins> we can use <del><ArtOrDet>airplane</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an airplane</ins> to do so. 
In the past, it took a few days to receive a message as we <del><Vt>need</Vt></del><ins>needed</ins> to post our <del><Mec>letter</Mec></del><ins>letter,</ins> and now, we can use <del><Mec>e-mail</Mec></del><ins>e-mail,</ins> which stands for electronic <del><Mec>message</Mec></del><ins>message,</ins> to send messages to our friends or even use our <del><Wci>handphone</Wci></del><ins>mobile phone</ins> to send our messages. 
From the example that I have mentioned <del><Mec>earlier</Mec></del><ins>earlier,</ins> we can see that <del><Nn>distance</Nn></del><ins>distances</ins> between us and our loved <del><Nn>one</Nn></del><ins>ones</ins> are getting further apart. 
This is because <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> the ease of technology such as <del><ArtOrDet>airplane</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the airplane</ins>, some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their <del><Rloc->studies</Rloc-></del><ins>studies,</ins> or <del><Wci>even</Wci></del><ins>maybe</ins> you are away from your family <del><Vform>to pursue</Vform></del><ins>pursuing</ins> your studies or even careers <del><Rloc->in life</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
Thus, this makes Twitter and Facebook <del><Rloc->become</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> one of the <del><Nn>medium</Nn></del><ins>media</ins> that we need. 
Nevertheless,everything in life has positive and negative effects. 
This is applicable to these social media sites. 
The next two paragraphs will <del><Vform>be discussing</Vform></del><ins>discuss</ins> <del><Prep>about</Prep></del><ins></ins> the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society. 

With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them. 
Social media sites such as Facebook <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> <del><Vt>allow</Vt></del><ins>allowed</ins> us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas. 
This <del><Nn>approaches</Nn></del><ins>approach</ins> <del><SVA>help </SVA></del><ins>helps</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities <del><Rloc->that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> their children <del><Wci>have</Wci></del><ins>do</ins> when they are overseas. 
The social media <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> beneficial as <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> connect you and your loved one even though you are separated by <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> distance. 
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your <del><Mec>family</Mec></del><ins>family,</ins> but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family. 

As I mentioned <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> the beginning, there <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> also disadvantages <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> social media tools. 
One of them is that <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> reduce the level of <del><Mec>concentration</Mec></del><ins>concentration,</ins> especially among the <del><Wtone>youngsters</Wtone></del><ins>young people</ins>. 
This is because it is part of everyone's habit to check their <del><Npos>facebook's</Npos></del><ins>Facebook</ins> <del><Mec>page</Mec></del><ins>page,</ins> as their friends will post something new every second. 
Thus, you can see that some students will browse <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> while attending lectures. 
This means that the students are not <del><Mec>concetrating</Mec></del><ins>concentrating</ins> when they <del><V0>supposed</V0></del><ins>are supposed</ins> to do so. 
As a result, it could affect their lives and studies. 
This <del><Rloc->will</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> then could lead to <del><Mec>stress</Mec></del><ins>stress,</ins> as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted. 

In my opinion, every individual has to take responsibility <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> their own lives by making <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> right decision. 
There are advantages and disadvantages <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> using social media sites , <del><Trans>however</Trans></del><ins>but</ins> in this <del><Mec>case</Mec></del><ins>case,</ins> striking <del><ArtOrDet>balance</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a balance</ins> between social media and <del><Nn>lives</Nn></del><ins>life</ins> is the most important thing to do. 

Nowadays, the use of <del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe news</ins><del><Mec>sociall</Mec></del><ins>social</ins> media platforms is <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> commonplace in our lives
<del><ArtOrDet>In</ArtOrDet></del><ins>In an</ins> increasingly globalised world, such platforms even <del><SVA>enhances</SVA></del><ins>enhance</ins> and <del><SVA>compliccates</SVA></del><ins>complicate</ins> the links between <del><Mec>indivduals</Mec></del><ins>individuals</ins> in the world. 
Thanks to them, people can get to know one another online, without having to travel to meet up for business purposes <del><Rloc->for companies</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> or personal reasons. 
However, it is also <del><Others>bringing</Others></del><ins>bringing about</ins> some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world, resulting in some negative impacts <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><Npos>individuaul's</Npos></del><ins>individuals'</ins> daily lives <del><Mec>and</Mec></del><ins>and,</ins> <del><Mec>therefore</Mec></del><ins>therefore,</ins> becoming a <del><Wci>large</Wci></del><ins>big</ins> problem in <del><Nn>societies</Nn></del><ins>society</ins> as a whole. 

As people spend more and more time on such social media sites, the importance of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> face-to-face human <del><Nn>contacts</Nn></del><ins>contact</ins> has <del><Mec>decresed</Mec></del><ins>decreased</ins>. 
As people feel more confident <del><Mec>online</Mec></del><ins>online,</ins> where they do not have to face <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>real-life</Mec></del><ins>real life</ins> on the spot, they feel more comfortable <del><Mec>and</Mec></del><ins>and,</ins> <del><Mec>thus</Mec></del><ins>thus,</ins> prefer communicating online. 
This results in <del><ArtOrDet>lack</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a lack</ins> of interpersonal skills in <del><Nn>individual</Nn></del><ins>individuals</ins>, especially young <del><Mec>students</Mec></del><ins>students,</ins> as they always have <del><ArtOrDet>option</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the option</ins> to turn their back <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>real-life</Mec></del><ins>real life</ins> and go online. 
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but <del><Rloc->have</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> to face things in real life. 
As they are so used to having an online avatar, they may lose their <del><Wci>self-identity</Wci></del><ins>sense of self</ins> in real life and may not <del><Wci>realise</Wci></del><ins>know</ins> how to <del><Prep>interact</Prep></del><ins>interact with</ins> people in <del><Mec>real-life</Mec></del><ins>real life</ins>. 

Another problem with social media is that<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> the benefits <del><Prep>from</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> investing such enormous <del><Others>time</Others></del><ins>amounts of time</ins> and energy is not <del><Mec>relfected</Mec></del><ins>reflected</ins> as something positive to the users. 
The reason why it is so addictive is, that the more people get into <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media, <del><Spar>they</Spar></del><ins>the more they</ins> seek attention from their friends. 
However, such sparks of sudden attention <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> extremely <del><Wform>short-termed</Wform></del><ins>short-term</ins> <del><Rloc->and gone eaily</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Trans>thus </Trans></del><ins>, so they</ins><del><SVA>does</SVA></del><ins>do</ins> not add any value or meaning to the user's life. 
Also, according to <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> research, it has been proven that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> users feel <del><Wform>more sad</Wform></del><ins>sadder</ins> after using <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>Facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook,</ins> and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people's lives. 
But seriously, most people only post the happiest moments in their lives. 

Social media definitely <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> some other strong benefits that make the users stay <del><Others>is</Others></del><ins>, and one of them is</ins> the links <del><Prep>among</Prep></del><ins>between</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> people. 
Indeed, I myself use Facebook just because of the <del><Wform>friends' contacts</Wform></del><ins>contact with friends</ins> that I want to keep. 
However, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> friendship <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>such</ArtOrDet></del><ins>such a</ins> virtual world is so superficial <del><Trans>which</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> is not so relevant to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>real-life</Mec></del><ins>real life</ins>. 
Also, as numerous profit-driven companies <del><Wci>realize</Wci></del><ins>recognise</ins> the <del><Mec>hugh</Mec></del><ins>huge</ins> human traffic on such social media sites, they make it <del><Prep>as</Prep></del><ins></ins> a pond to <del><Prep>fish</Prep></del><ins>fish for</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> customers by uploading many advertisements. 
<del><Mec>Furthermore</Mec></del><ins>Furthermore,</ins> this also possibly triggers the privacy issues as <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information on the users. 
As this happens, users are more and more <del><Wci>pron</Wci></del><ins>vulnerable</ins> to any possible frauds. 

Social media sites are at their <del><Nn>peaks</Nn></del><ins>peak</ins> at the moment<del><Mec>, however</Mec></del><ins>. 
However</ins>, I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better <del><Wtone>persons</Wtone></del><ins>people</ins> in <del><Mec>real-life</Mec></del><ins>real life</ins>, they will not <del><Vform>be indulged</Vform></del><ins>indulge</ins> in it as much as they <del><Wci>are</Wci></del><ins>do</ins> now. 
The users, soon, will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> their friends because, if they really need somebody, they will <del><Wci>reach</Wci></del><ins>get in contact with</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>friends</Mec></del><ins>friends,</ins> no matter what. 

We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media, but do we really get connected or <del><Spar>falling</Spar></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfall</ins> apart? 
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are <del><Wci>born</Wci></del><ins>created</ins> with the intention of connecting people<del><Rloc->,</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> from around the world. 
The idea seems great, and nowadays most <del><Mec>people</Mec></del><ins>people,</ins> even the older <del><Mec>generation</Mec></del><ins>generation,</ins> will have at least one social media <del><Mec>platform</Mec></del><ins>platform,</ins> like Facebook. 
<del><ArtOrDet>The parents</ArtOrDet></del><ins>Parents</ins> are now the "friends" of their kids, and they can now "follow" their kids more closely and <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> real time. 
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently<del><Rloc->,</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> to be connected with their <del><Mec>so called</Mec></del><ins>so-called</ins> friends. 
However, as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> face-to-face human contact, that eventually affects our interpersonal skills. 

First and foremost, I would like to share <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins></ins> the advantages of using such social media in my daily life. 
As a student, I tend to meet lots of people from different <del><Nn>background</Nn></del><ins>backgrounds</ins> and <del><Prep>at</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> different settings. 
We may meet only once but we exchange <del><ArtOrDet>our</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> contact numbers as well as facebook <del><Nn>account</Nn></del><ins>accounts</ins> in order to keep in touch. 
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call, social media like facebook <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> a great way for friends from different <del><Nn>field</Nn></del><ins>fields</ins> or even from different parts of the world to be connected. 
Within clicks, we <del><Vm>could</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> check on <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> friend's profile and read on for his/her updates. 
<del><Wci>On another hand</Wci></del><ins>On the other hand</ins>, we <del><Vm>could</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends <del><Vm>could</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> read up on the newsfeed. 
This allows friends that may not have the time <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> meet up to <del><V0>still</V0></del><ins>still be</ins> connected in a way. 
Not only that, <del><Trans>new</Trans></del><ins>but new</ins> friends can <del><WOadv>be easily</WOadv></del><ins>easily be</ins> met through such online platforms. 
Hence, our social circle is indeed expanding. 

Nonetheless, what seems to make us connected can be the cause that <del><WOinc>falls us</WOinc></del><ins>makes us fall</ins> apart. 
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is <del><Rloc->that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> the time reduction on face-to-face contact. 
This subsequently leads to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle. 
For example, we <del><Prep>tend</Prep></del><ins>tend to</ins> send <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> birthday wishes when Facebook <del><Mec>promts</Mec></del><ins>prompts</ins> us "Today is someone's birthday". 
In fact, we may have just forgotten our friend's birthday. 
We used to send <del><Wci>wishes</Wci></del><ins>greetings</ins> cards during festive <del><Nn>season</Nn></del><ins>seasons</ins> like Chinese New Year, and we <del><Vt>feel</Vt></del><ins>felt</ins> so good to write one and of course to receive one with stamps on it. 
Gone <del><Vt>were</Vt></del><ins>are</ins> the times, and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes. 
As time <del><Vt>passed</Vt></del><ins>passes</ins>, we may have more "friends" on the list, but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined. 

<del><Wci>In a nutshell</Wci></del><ins>In summary</ins>, <del><Wci>every sword has two edges</Wci></del><ins>there are two sides to every coin</ins>. 
The users of <del><ArtOrDet>every</ArtOrDet></del><ins>all</ins> social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one. 
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of <del><Pref>its</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> impacts on the actual life that we have. 
Ultimately, the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face <del><Mec>meetings </Mec></del><ins>meetings,</ins><del><Trans>but</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> social media sites are only <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> tools to enhance it. 

Nowadays, social media sites are commonly used in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfall</ins> society
I believe 80 <del><Nn>percents</Nn></del><ins>per cent</ins> of people <del><Wci>plays</Wci></del><ins>use</ins> social media sites. 
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world. 
It consists of <del><Rloc->the function of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> connecting, sharing, interacting and advertising. 
However, there are also some disadvantages <del><Rloc->occur</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> due to the social media which are <del><Wci>concerned</Wci></del><ins>a cause for concern</ins> in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
Therefore, this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily life. 

First, with the function of social media sites that connects <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> people, everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and <del><Nn>families</Nn></del><ins>family</ins>, or even <del><Mec>strangers</Mec></del><ins>strangers,</ins> without any time and place constraints. 
Through the social media sites, we can chat with our friends who <del><Wci>stay</Wci></del><ins>are</ins> in Europe and New Zealand. 
There are over <del><ArtOrDet>thousand</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a thousand</ins> miles between Singapore and these two countries. 
However, we are able to chat with our friends without <del><Vform>travel</Vform></del><ins>travelling</ins> to the countries. 
It saves a lot of money and time as well as <del><Vform>strengthen</Vform></del><ins>strengthening</ins> our <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> although we <del><Wci>stay</Wci></del><ins>are</ins> <del><Prep>at</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> different places around the world. 

Besides that, <del><Nn>company</Nn></del><ins>companies</ins> <del><WOadv>also can</WOadv></del><ins>can also</ins> use the convenience of social media sites<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins></ins> such as Facebook chat or Skype to facilitate <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> meeting with <del><Wci>parties of project</Wci></del><ins>project partners</ins> from around the world. 
Substantial <del><Nn>cost</Nn></del><ins>costs</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> saved without the tiring travel from one point to another point. 
With the huge amount of cost savings, this capital can be utilized in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> other <del><Mec>sectors</Mec></del><ins>sectors,</ins> which benefits <del><Nn>company</Nn></del><ins>companies</ins> more and <del><Spar>boost</Spar></del><ins>boosts</ins> <del><Prep>up</Prep></del><ins></ins> the company's profit. 

However, <del><Wci>there are two sides of stories always</Wci></del><ins>there are two sides to every coin</ins>. 
Some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins>. 
Since ancient times, <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> <del><Vt>interact</Vt></del><ins>have been interacting</ins> with others face <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> face. 
Without the facial <del><Wci>impression</Wci></del><ins>expression</ins>, it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers. 
That is why facial <del><Wci>impression</Wci></del><ins>expression</ins> is one of the most important elements in social learning. 

In addition, "social media sites will affect writing skills"<del><Mec>, that</Mec></del><ins>. 
That</ins> is the point of view in society. 
<del><Prep>Based on </Prep></del><ins>According to</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the </ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins><del><Wform>statistic</Wform></del><ins>statistical</ins> <del><Nn>report</Nn></del><ins>reports</ins>, <del><WOinc>the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites</WOinc></del><ins>the more time is spent on social media sites, the more writing skills will be reduced</ins>. 
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly <del><Vform>forget</Vform></del><ins>forgetting</ins> how to write a word that we should know. 
The <del><Mec>auto correction</Mec></del><ins>autocorrection</ins> software is so effective when using electronic <del><Nn>device</Nn></del><ins>devices</ins> <del><Ssub>until</Ssub></del><ins>that</ins> we <del><Vt>did</Vt></del><ins>do</ins> not realize the importance of writing. 
Writing is an essential skill <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>person</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a person</ins> <del><Ssub>who</Ssub></del><ins></ins> <del><Vform>express</Vform></del><ins>to express</ins> their own feelings and opinions. 

'Privacy'<del><Rloc->, this</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> is <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> word <del><V0>that</V0></del><ins>that is</ins> popular <del><Wci>in these few decades</Wci></del><ins>in recent decades</ins>. 
<del><Nn>Human</Nn></del><ins>Humans</ins> <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> their own rights and privacy. 
I believe that most of us agree with these terms. 
However, there is news about the social media sites <del><Vform>leaks</Vform></del><ins>leaking</ins> users' information to companies <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> cash reimbursement. 
Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then <del><Vt>transfer</Vt></del><ins>transferred</ins> to the companies for spying and advertising. 
Although it looks like <del><Um>no laws</Um></del><ins></ins> and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want, you are actually wrong. 
You are not only controlled by <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> government <del><Mec>laws</Mec></del><ins>laws,</ins> but also <del><Prep>spied</Prep></del><ins>spied on</ins> by the government. 

In conclusion, <del><Wci>everything has two sides of stories</Wci></del><ins>there are two sides to every story</ins>. 
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites. 
To utilize the technology well, we should <del><Wci>do</Wci></del><ins>make</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>our</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an</ins> effort to not only balance the pros and <del><Mec>cons</Mec></del><ins>cons,</ins> but also <del><Spar>lengthen</Spar></del><ins>to lengthen</ins> the pros and shorten the cons. 
Thus, the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and <del><ArtOrDet>next</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the next</ins> generation. 

With the <del><Mec>wide spread</Mec></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespread</ins> <del><Others>of</Others></del><ins></ins> advanced technology, social media sites are becoming more and more popular
Getting connected on social media such as <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> and <del><Mec>twitter </Mec></del><ins>Twitter</ins><del><Vt>has become</Vt></del><ins>is</ins> a main trend as well as <del><ArtOrDet>daily</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a daily</ins> <del><Wci>work</Wci></del><ins>activity</ins> nowadays. 
With this situation, both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life. 

<del><Wci>On one side</Wci></del><ins>On the one hand</ins>, it is <del><Wform>obvioualy</Wform></del><ins>obvious</ins> that many advantages have been brought to our lives. 
Social media <del><SVA>provides</SVA></del><ins>provide</ins> people with the opportunity to get <del><Prep>contact</Prep></del><ins>in contact</ins> with each other <del><Wci>every time</Wci></del><ins>anytime</ins> and <del><Wci>everywhere</Wci></del><ins>anywhere</ins>. 
Whether we are at home or at school, at work or on <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> holiday, we are able to communicate and interact with our friends. 
Even when people are thousands of miles apart, social media make it possible to have interaction by <del><Rloc->keep</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> writing comments. 
When our phones are accidentally <del><Um>done</Um></del><ins></ins>, we can also use the social media to get <del><Prep>contact</Prep></del><ins>in contact</ins> with our friends. 
Some people who are <del><Vform>try</Vform></del><ins>trying</ins> to talk in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> public can also actively take part in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> group chatting via social media. 
Besides, we can make more friends <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>through</ins> such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in. 
Therefore, the popularity of social media sites <del><SVA>have</SVA></del><ins>has</ins> made it more convenient for people <del><Mec>ot</Mec></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Wci>update</Wci></del><ins>keep up to date with</ins> friends' status and contact <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> friends more frequently. 

<del><Wci>On the other side</Wci></del><ins>On the other hand</ins>, we need to <del><Wci>rethink</Wci></del><ins>think</ins> about the influences <del><Wci>brought</Wci></del><ins>exerted</ins> by <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media. 
There are still many disadvantages <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> using social media. 
Firstly, interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact. 
While social media <del><SVA>brings</SVA></del><ins>bring</ins> convenience to <del><Npos>people</Npos></del><ins>people's</ins> <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins>, people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face <del><Mec>chatting</Mec></del><ins>chatting,</ins> which has a time and place requirement. 
People who are not good at <del><Wci>public</Wci></del><ins>face-to-face</ins> chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people, and their interpersonal skills can never be improved <del><Prep>under</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> this situation. 
Secondly, people's <del><Wci>over-addition</Wci></del><ins>addiction</ins> may avoidably, to some degree, exacerbate social alienation, and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> over-dependence <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> virtual social networking. 
More and more networking has been transferred to <del><ArtOrDet>internet</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the internet</ins> from real life. 
This is a potential danger for <del><Mec>teenagers</Mec></del><ins>teenagers,</ins> who are <del><Prep>growing</Prep></del><ins>growing up</ins> with <del><Um>social changes to get hurt</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
Thirdly, a lot of updating of luxury living <del><Nn>standard</Nn></del><ins>standards</ins> as well as other <del><Wci>show-off situations</Wci></del><ins>showing off</ins> may make people's daily life more and more <del><Wci>grandiloquent</Wci></del><ins>extravagant</ins>, which is not an <del><Um>accurate social growing trend</Um></del><ins></ins>. 
Lastly, it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media. 
Again, there is a trend for them to suffer from social media <del><Mec>addition</Mec></del><ins>addiction</ins> and their <del><Nn>study</Nn></del><ins>studies</ins> and work may be greatly influenced. 

Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media, and we cannot deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us, this main trend of using social media may <del><Vform>be still lasting</Vform></del><ins>still last</ins> for a long time. 
Therefore, <del><Wci>everytime when</Wci></del><ins>whenever</ins> we use social media, we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid <del><Vform>be</Vform></del><ins>being</ins> affected by the disadvantages. 
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media. 

In <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreada</ins> sophisticated era like these days, experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier
Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies <del><Vt>were enhanced continuously</Vt></del><ins>have been continuously enhanced</ins>. 
<del><ArtOrDet>Telephone</ArtOrDet></del><ins>The telephone</ins> may <del><Vt>be</Vt></del><ins>have been</ins> perceived as <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> <del><Wform>big</Wform></del><ins>biggest</ins> innovation created ever <del><Rloc->when</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> the first time Graham Bell introduced it. 
However, <del><Wci>since </Wci></del><ins>as soon as</ins><del><ArtOrDet>internet</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the internet</ins> <del><SVA>were</SVA></del><ins>was</ins> <del><Wci>known</Wci></del><ins>introduced</ins>, <del><ArtOrDet>telephone</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the telephone</ins> started to give way to social media sites. 

Many advantages are given to the users. 
Let us take <del><ArtOrDet>example</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the example</ins> <del><Prep>from</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> Facebook and Twitter, two of the most famous social media sites. 
Through Facebook, <del><Mec>peope</Mec></del><ins>people</ins> are able to maintain <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> with their old acquaintances. 
This benefit cannot be obtained <del><Prep>through</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> telephone or mail because people's <del><Wci>particular</Wci></del><ins>details</ins> and address may change from time to <del><Mec>time</Mec></del><ins>time,</ins> while on Facebook, people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo, for example, as the identifier. 
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service, personal profile, <del><Wci>media</Wci></del><ins>way</ins> of sharing, and other entertainment <del><Nn>add-on</Nn></del><ins>add-ons</ins> (i.e. 
social games) which allow users to communicate with <del><WOinc>remote people</WOinc></del><ins>people who are far away</ins>, and also to <del><Wci>update</Wci></del><ins>keep up to date</ins> and express themselves at the same time. 

Twitter, <del><Pref>that</Pref></del><ins>which</ins> has <del><ArtOrDet>more</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a more</ins> simplified function compared to Facebook, gives more benefit if used as <del><ArtOrDet>information</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an information</ins> sharing <del><Nn>media</Nn></del><ins>medium</ins>. 
Twitter only <del><SVA>allow</SVA></del><ins>allows</ins> users to give <del><ArtOrDet>update</ArtOrDet></del><ins>an update</ins> that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast, <del><Um>that only highlighted</Um></del><ins></ins> messages are delivered. 
<del><Prep>For</Prep></del><ins>With</ins> Facebook, a comprehensive way of sharing is <del><Mec>offered</Mec></del><ins>offered,</ins> since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded, long notes can be published, <del><Trans>even</Trans></del><ins>and even</ins> documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays. 
These advantages also <del><SVA>comes</SVA></del><ins>come</ins> in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile <del><Nn>application</Nn></del><ins>applications</ins> <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> our smartphones. 

Despite the luxury that is offered by social media, there are also harmful side effects which people may not <del><Wci>realize </Wci></del><ins>recognise</ins><del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins></ins> beforehand. 
<del><Nn>Researches</Nn></del><ins>Research</ins> <del><SVA>show</SVA></del><ins>shows</ins> that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing. 
As <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> consequence, <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>this</ins> affects their interpersonal skills. 
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to <del><Mec>say</Mec></del><ins>say,</ins> but in face-to-face communication, every word that comes out of your mouth and may <del><WOadv>be not</WOadv></del><ins>not be</ins> well arranged is <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> picture of your personality. 
This skill requires <del><Nn>practices</Nn></del><ins>practice</ins> and cannot be done completely through social media. 

There is a situation where a family is having <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget, posting <del><Nn>picture</Nn></del><ins>pictures</ins> <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> Facebook, updating <del><ArtOrDet>status</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their status</ins> on Twitter, or even chatting with friends. 
These social media <del><SVA>serves</SVA></del><ins>serve</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> purpose <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> <del><Wci>bind</Wci></del><ins>connecting</ins> people in spite of their geographical <del><Mec>boundaries</Mec></del><ins>boundaries,</ins> but <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>that</ins> <del><Vm>doesn't</Vm></del><ins>shouldn't</ins> mean that <del><Wci>surrounding people</Wci></del><ins>people around us</ins> are neglected as <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> payoff. 
This is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned before, that can <del><Vform>be decreasing</Vform></del><ins>decrease</ins> qualitatively if we are used to facing <del><ArtOrDet>gadget</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a gadget</ins>, <del><Trans>not</Trans></del><ins>rather than</ins> facing <del><ArtOrDet>human</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a human</ins> being. 

Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected <del><Nn>part</Nn></del><ins>parts</ins> of our lives, we <del><ArtOrDet>build</ArtOrDet></del><ins>build a</ins> "false image" in public. 
We tend to only share our happy moments <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><Others>media</Others></del><ins>social media</ins>. 
Because of this, other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no <del><Nn>problem</Nn></del><ins>problems</ins> at all. 
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same. 
As a result, people <del><Wci>think of theirselves lowly</Wci></del><ins>have a low opinion of themselves</ins> and <del><Pref>may</Pref></del><ins>this may</ins> lead to depression and mental disorder. 
It also reduces our sympathy. 
This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people. 

As explained above, modern and sophisticated technology doesn't always <del><Wci>give</Wci></del><ins>bring</ins> advantages. 
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not <del><Wci>realize</Wci></del><ins>be aware</ins> of. 
It is up to people's discretion and <del><Wci>comprehension</Wci></del><ins>understanding</ins> to decide which side they want to take. 
So, we should never forget to think <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> and calculate the benefit and <del><Wci>loss</Wci></del><ins>cost</ins> of every decision that we make. 

Nowadays, the advancement of technologies <del><WOinc>improves the life of many people a lot</WOinc></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many people</ins>
In most <del><Rloc->of the</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> countries, there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. 
Many people think that the social media sites have benefits <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> the communication between <del><Mec>people</Mec></del><ins>people,</ins> while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 

One of the advantages which are <del><Wci>carried</Wci></del><ins>offered</ins> by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before. 
In the past <del><Rloc->decades</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>, when the social media sites <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> not yet fully developed, people <del><Vt>connect</Vt></del><ins>connected</ins> with others who <del><Vt>live</Vt></del><ins>lived</ins> far away by using a phone, or even a letter. 
However, calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter <del><Wci>require</Wci></del><ins>involve</ins> some cost, and sending a letter to a person who <del><SVA>live</SVA></del><ins>lives</ins> far away, especially in villages, takes <del><Wci>much</Wci></del><ins>a lot of</ins> time. 
The appearance of those social media sites <del><Vt>causes</Vt></del><ins>has caused</ins> those problems to be solved. 
People connecting through the social media sites <del><Rloc->can</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> spend no money on <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> communication, and <del><Pref>also</Pref></del><ins>it also</ins> <del><SVA>take</SVA></del><ins>takes</ins> only one or a few seconds for the message to <del><Wci>reach</Wci></del><ins>arrive</ins>. 
Therefore, this advantage of social media sites saves money and time, and also provides convenience for many people. 

Moreover, this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they <del><Vt>did not see</Vt></del><ins>have not seen</ins> for a very long time, such as their friends <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> primary school and secondary school. 
As we graduate from a school, we will probably lose contact with some of our friends. 
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses, and we are not able to find them through a <del><Wci>phone</Wci></del><ins>phone call</ins> or a letter. 
If phone and letter <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> the only way to contact them, we would probably not <del><V0>able</V0></del><ins>be able</ins> to find them. 
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to <del><Vform>make</Vform></del><ins>making</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>connection</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a connection</ins> between us and our old friends. 
Hence, the social media sites <del><SVA>serves</SVA></del><ins>serve</ins> as a platform for <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> connection. 

Everything <del><Npos>comes</Npos></del><ins>that comes</ins> with benefits will also have <del><Pref>their</Pref></del><ins>its</ins> disadvantages. 
On the other hand, social media sites also bring some negative impacts for <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>people</Wci></del><ins>individuals</ins> and <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 
The advancement of those social media sites makes people <del><WOadv>so rely on them</WOadv></del><ins>rely on them so much</ins> that some of them <del><Rloc->rather</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> prefer using those sites to contact each other <del><Prep>than</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> talking to each other face to face. 
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites. 
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life, which <del><Mec>will</Mec></del><ins>will,</ins> in <del><Mec>turn</Mec></del><ins>turn,</ins> cause the <del><Wform>lost</Wform></del><ins>loss</ins> of interpersonal skills for many people. 
As we all know, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas. 
The <del><Wform>lost</Wform></del><ins>loss</ins> of interpersonal skills results in the inability <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> people to <del><WOadv>well present their ideas</WOadv></del><ins>present their ideas well</ins>. 
As a result, they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society. 

In conclusion, social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society. 
As a part of this modern society, we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies, and also learn to avoid the <del><Wci>cons</Wci></del><ins>disadvantages</ins> and maximize the benefits of those sites. 

With the advancement of technology in recent years, the need to keep <del><Mec>in-touch</Mec></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many peoplein touch</ins> with people and <del><ArtOrDet>latest</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the latest</ins> news has become a tremendous demand
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. 
With <del><Rloc->an increasing users of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> more than <del><ArtOrDet>billion</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a billion</ins> users from all over the world, social media sites have <del><WOadv>demonstrated clearly </WOadv></del><ins>clearly demonstrated</ins><del><Pref>its</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> success <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> playing an important part <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> our <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins>. 
However, there are arguments that social media <del><Rloc->life</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Wci>brings in</Wci></del><ins>lead to</ins> a reduction in face-to-face human contact, <del><Mec>which</Mec></del><ins>which,</ins> in <del><Mec>turn</Mec></del><ins>turn,</ins> affects interpersonal skills. 
Let's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society. 

First and foremost, all social media sites are free. 
All <del><Mec>users'</Mec></del><ins>users</ins> <del><SVA>needs</SVA></del><ins>need</ins> are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media <del><Rloc->life</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
Secondly, it helps people to keep <del><Mec>in-touch</Mec></del><ins>in touch</ins> with one another. 
Finding old friends through Facebook, for example, is <del><Wform>more easier</Wform></del><ins>easier</ins> than asking people <del><Prep>around</Prep></del><ins></ins> in real life. 
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer. 
Thirdly, social media sites keep us up-to-date on <del><ArtOrDet>latest</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the latest</ins> news and updates from almost everywhere in the world, all with a click <del><Rloc->away</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> on the refresh button. 
Last but not least, social media sites also link people together <del><Prep>through</Prep></del><ins>by</ins> allowing us to create our own groups, pages or sites to share our hobbies, interests and studies in particular subjects. 
Hence, it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global <del><Mec>inter-connected</Mec></del><ins>interconnected</ins> world. 

However, social media sites also have <del><Pref>its</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> <del><Rloc->second side of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> negative impact on <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins>. 
<del><Wform>Undeniable</Wform></del><ins>Undeniably</ins>, it becomes more addicting when we spend more time busy socialising and interacting virtually. 
We spend <del><ArtOrDet>majority</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the majority</ins> of our time on sites like Facebook, Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance. 
In <del><ArtOrDet>corporate</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the corporate</ins> world, employers often block social media <del><Nn>network</Nn></del><ins>networks</ins> to prevent employees <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Vform>spend</Vform></del><ins>spending</ins> their office time on their personal leisure <del><Others>than</Others></del><ins>rather than</ins> concentrating on their work. 
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media <del><Nn>network</Nn></del><ins>networks</ins> also <del><Wci>brings in</Wci></del><ins>has</ins> a bad impact <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> us in <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> long term. 
The more time we spend on these sites, the <del><Wform>lesser</Wform></del><ins>less</ins> time we spend on face-to-face <del><Wform>interacting</Wform></del><ins>interaction</ins> with one another. 
Hence it lessens valuable interaction between <del><Nn>human</Nn></del><ins>humans</ins> and <del><ArtOrDet>time</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the time</ins> we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone. 
In addition, there are also some false reports and fake IDs <del><Rloc->occur</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> on both social media sites <del><Pref>that</Pref></del><ins>where</ins> people use fake <del><Nn>ID</Nn></del><ins>IDs</ins> to insult or harass someone, like the case of Heather Chua <del><Ssub>occurred</Ssub></del><ins>which occurred</ins> recently on Facebook. 
These malicious comments often go viral and it <del><Wci>creates</Wci></del><ins>has</ins> a strong negative effect on the real user in real life, which might lead to <del><Wci>unwilling attitude</Wci></del><ins>unwillingness</ins> to interact with others in real life <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>on the part of</ins> the victim. 

In conclusion, <del><Wci>everything has its two-sided affect</Wci></del><ins>there are two sides to everything</ins> and it depends on how we exploit it. 
With <del><ArtOrDet>current</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the current</ins> booming technology, it is <del><Wci>agreeable</Wci></del><ins>good</ins> that people <del><Vt>become</Vt></del><ins>are becoming</ins> more <del><Wform>technology-savvy</Wform></del><ins>tech savvy</ins> and they want to spend more time interacting with each <del><Mec>others</Mec></del><ins>other</ins> through social media sites<del><Mec>, however</Mec></del><ins>. 
However</ins>, it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays <del><WOadv>even a</WOadv></del><ins>an even</ins> more important <del><Wci>aspect</Wci></del><ins>role</ins> in our <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins>. 

As more and more social <del><Wci>websites</Wci></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many peoplein touchnetworks</ins> such as <del><Mec>Twitter ,</Mec></del><ins>Twitter,</ins> Facebook and Weibo <del><Ssub>which</Ssub></del><ins></ins> have become ubiquitous, seamless and imperative in our life, people may worry about the <del><Wform>young</Wform></del><ins>younger</ins> generation having problems <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> face-to-face communication skills
However, I believe that the benefits brought by these online <del><Wform>chatting</Wform></del><ins>chat</ins> rooms tremendously outweigh their <del><Wci>repercussions</Wci></del><ins>disadvantages</ins>. 

Social media <del><SVA>enables</SVA></del><ins>enable</ins> us to explore the world far far away without <del><Prep>paying</Prep></del><ins>paying for</ins> expensive airplane tickets and <del><Wci>sparing</Wci></del><ins>sacrificing</ins> a one-week holiday. 
The convenience is beyond description. 
With a small <del><Mec>smart phone</Mec></del><ins>smartphone</ins> or a computer at school, at work or at home, we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them, reading their blogs, photos and status. 

Compared to face-to-face interaction, online conversation <del><Wci>is</Wci></del><ins>makes it</ins> easier for strangers to <del><Wci>open their mouth</Wci></del><ins>talk</ins> to each other. 
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page, it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about. 
Moreover, people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off. 
<del><Pref>This</Pref></del><ins>It</ins> has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012, <del><Trans>80%</Trans></del><ins>that 80%</ins> of information posted online is <del><Mec>true</Mec></del><ins>true,</ins> while a person may <del><Mec>like</Mec></del><ins>lie</ins> 3 out of 10 times in real life. 
This shows that a <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> account. 
That is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world. 
Although sometimes <del><ArtOrDet>those</ArtOrDet></del><ins>this</ins> genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful, such as prevalent <del><Wform>using</Wform></del><ins>use</ins> of vulgarity and <del><Wci>harsh-meaning</Wci></del><ins>harsh</ins> comments, we can minimize those <del><Wci>repercussions</Wci></del><ins>disadvantages</ins> through strict <del><Nn>regulations</Nn></del><ins>regulation</ins> of content online. 

Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy. 
People around the world <del><Vm>could</Vm></del><ins>can</ins> easily share their thoughts about their governments. 
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what <del><WOadv>actually is</WOadv></del><ins>is actually</ins> happening around them. 
One of the examples is the 2012 riots <del><Ssub>happened</Ssub></del><ins>which happened</ins> in Egypt and Zambia. 
The idea of searching for democracy <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media. 
However, as the government controls most of the media<del><Sfrag>. 
These</Sfrag></del><ins>, these</ins> social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public. 
For example, <del><ArtOrDet>in</ArtOrDet></del><ins>in the</ins> 2012 general election <del><Mec>is</Mec></del><ins>in</ins> Singapore, Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> to spread his campaign videos to the public. 
<del><Prep>Though because of</Prep></del><ins>Despite</ins> this, social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional <del><Nn>medias</Nn></del><ins>media</ins>. 

Intensive use of <del><Mec>Social</Mec></del><ins>social</ins> media does reduce the time people spend <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> face-to-face communication. 
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people <del><V0>sitting</V0></del><ins>are sitting</ins> together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands. 
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends. 
In this case, I have to say that to err is human. 
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends <del><Wci>just</Wci></del><ins>right</ins> by their side and teach them to manage their time well. 

In conclusion, the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> our daily lifes. 
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online. 
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities, the virtual world would be a better world. 

Social media sites' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable. 
<del><Nn>Thank</Nn></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many peoplein touchnetworksThanks</ins> to those social media, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> communication <del><Prep>among</Prep></del><ins>between</ins> people all over the world is possible and can be <del><Wci>done</Wci></del><ins>conducted</ins> with ease
Apart from the ease of communication despite <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> the distance, many other <del><Wci>advantages</Wci></del><ins>activities</ins> such as knowledge sharing and <del><Wci>trades</Wci></del><ins>business</ins> can be done through social media as well. 
Nevertheless, with those advantages, some disadvantages may <del><Mec>appear</Mec></del><ins>appear,</ins> such as reduction in face-to-face human <del><Mec>contact</Mec></del><ins>contact,</ins> which affects interpersonal skills, privacy <del><Nn>issue</Nn></del><ins>issues</ins>, as well as some <del><Wci>frauds</Wci></del><ins>fraudulent activities</ins> that can be <del><Wci>done</Wci></del><ins>committed</ins> through social media. 

Twitter, Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries. 
Through those <del><Mec>sites</Mec></del><ins>sites,</ins> we are able to talk to them, to know what their activities are and who their friends are, etc. 
<del><Wci>From the surface point of view</Wci></del><ins>On the face of it,</ins> <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>there</ins> is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> the distance. 
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well<del><Mec>, that</Mec></del><ins>. 
That</ins> is <del><Mec>why nowadays</Mec></del><ins>why, nowadays,</ins> many news publishers <del><Wci>make</Wci></del><ins>set up</ins> their own social media account<del><Mec>, for</Mec></del><ins>. 
For</ins> <del><Mec>example</Mec></del><ins>example,</ins> Channel News Asia has a <del><Mec>twitter</Mec></del><ins>Twitter</ins> account and will update its <del><Nn>follower</Nn></del><ins>followers</ins> with headline news. 
That shows <del><Mec>how </Mec></del><ins>how,</ins><del><Wci>actually</Wci></del><ins>these days,</ins> news and information can be shared easily through social media. 
Furthermore, since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media, <del><ArtOrDet>these</ArtOrDet></del><ins>this</ins> information can reach them easily without them <del><Vform>need</Vform></del><ins>needing</ins> to watch or listen to the news reports. 
Due to the popularity of social media, many people <del><Vt>start</Vt></del><ins>have started</ins> to <del><Wci>do</Wci></del><ins>conduct</ins> their business via these sites. 
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook<del><Mec>, whether</Mec></del><ins>. 
Whether</ins> it is our friends who <del><Vt>sell</Vt></del><ins>are selling</ins> their products or professional brands selling their products online, we can get to <del><Others>buy</Others></del><ins>buy things</ins> and contact the sellers through those sites, which can be considered as an advantage for us, the buyers. 

However, is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them <del><Wci>personally</Wci></del><ins>face to face</ins>? I do think there is <del><ArtOrDet>difference</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a difference</ins> <del><Rloc->in it</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> and I believe many of us will agree
When we write or communicate virtually, we can hide our <del><Wci>through</Wci></del><ins>true</ins> feelings and <del><Mec>many</Mec></del><ins>may</ins> not <del><Wci>become</Wci></del><ins>be</ins> ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us. 
Other than that, sometimes the message of one party cannot be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language, and thus the 'tone' of the message sent and when it is received may be different. 
Many people are very brave <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> telling people about their opinions <del><Mec>online</Mec></del><ins>online,</ins> but in real <del><Mec>life</Mec></del><ins>life,</ins> some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all. 
This will lead to <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> bad <del><Mec>inter-personal</Mec></del><ins>interpersonal</ins> <del><Nn>skill</Nn></del><ins>skills</ins> as well as <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>problem</Nn></del><ins>problems</ins> of <del><Nn>trusts</Nn></del><ins>trust</ins>. 
<del><Mec>Nowadays</Mec></del><ins>Nowadays,</ins> we cannot really trust new people whom we know from social <del><Mec>media</Mec></del><ins>media,</ins> since we will never know whether they are even 'real'. 
Some people fake their identities <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><Others>media</Others></del><ins>social media</ins> sites so that they can know more people or some may even <del><Wci>cheat</Wci></del><ins>deceive</ins> others. 
In addition, <del><WOinc>privacy issue</WOinc></del><ins>the issue of privacy</ins> has become more <del><Wci>popular</Wci></del><ins>relevant</ins> <del><Mec>nowadays</Mec></del><ins>nowadays,</ins> since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> not willing to share <del><Prep>at</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> the first place. 

Therefore, while social media sites <del><Rloc->are</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> undoubtedly have benefits in our life, we should consider <del><Pref>its</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> drawbacks and <del><Mec>thus</Mec></del><ins>, thus,</ins> use <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><Wci>disadvantages</Wci></del><ins>inconvenience</ins> us in the smallest <del><WOinc>way as possible</WOinc></del><ins>possible way</ins>. 

It is a common scene that almost everyone <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many peoplein touchnetworksThankson</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> public transport is <del><Wci>watching</Wci></del><ins>looking</ins> at <del><ArtOrDet>phone</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a phone</ins> or wearing <del><Wci>a pair ear piece</Wci></del><ins>earphones</ins> in this modern society <del><Rloc->today</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>

Some say that it is a necessary step <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> human <del><Wci>revolution</Wci></del><ins>evolution</ins>. 
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people <del><Prep>in order for them to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><Vform>connect</Vform></del><ins>connecting</ins> to others even from different countries. 
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face <del><Wform>communicating</Wform></del><ins>communication</ins> <del><Mec>skills</Mec></del><ins>skills,</ins> which <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> important in their <del><Wform>working place</Wform></del><ins>workplace</ins>. 
This essay will discuss <del><Prep>about</Prep></del><ins></ins> the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life. 

One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily, even without <del><V0>contact</V0></del><ins>having had contact</ins> for a long time. 
In this fast <del><Wform>pace</Wform></del><ins>paced</ins> and competitive world, people may not <del><V0>able</V0></del><ins>be able</ins> to keep in touch with others. 
With the help of social media <del><Nn>site</Nn></del><ins>sites</ins>, people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny <del><Nn>scene</Nn></del><ins>scenes</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> and they can be updated <del><Prep>the</Prep></del><ins>on the</ins> new information of their friends. 
<del><Mec>Personally</Mec></del><ins>Personally,</ins> I <del><Rloc->am</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> study <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>oversea</Wform></del><ins>overseas</ins>, <del><Trans>busy</Trans></del><ins>and my busy</ins> study life keeps me <del><Rloc->away</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> from <del><Vform>contact</Vform></del><ins>contacting</ins> my old <del><Nn>friend</Nn></del><ins>friends</ins>. 
Using a common social media site with my friends <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><Vt>help</Vt></del><ins>helps</ins> me know what <del><WOinc>are their statuses</WOinc></del><ins>their statuses are</ins> nowadays. 
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them. 
In Singapore, many <del><Nn>Malaysian</Nn></del><ins>Malaysians</ins> cross the sea to work here. 
Many of them are busy in work and <del><Wform>separate</Wform></del><ins>separated</ins> <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>from</ins> their children. 
One <del><ArtOrDet>of</ArtOrDet></del><ins>of the</ins> <del><Nn>Manager</Nn></del><ins>managers</ins> in my <del><Wform>working place</Wform></del><ins>workplace</ins> has the same situation. 
After my <del><Mec>Manager</Mec></del><ins>manager</ins> taught her mother how to use Facebook, she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild. 
<del><Mec>Therefore</Mec></del><ins>Therefore,</ins> my <del><Mec>Manager</Mec></del><ins>manager</ins> would not miss <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> moments of her daughter's <del><Wci>growth</Wci></del><ins>development</ins>. 

Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship. 
<del><WOinc>People get connected or closer with same preferences</WOinc></del><ins>People with the same preferences get connected or closer</ins>. 
It is easier for people to approach the <del><Others>other</Others></del><ins>other person</ins> after <del><Wci>knowing</Wci></del><ins>finding out</ins> the information. 
Students can exchange <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> experiences <del><ArtOrDet>in</ArtOrDet></del><ins>in their</ins> <del><Nn>study</Nn></del><ins>studies</ins> even <del><Trans>they</Trans></del><ins>if they</ins> are in different countries. 
People are able to share <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> culture or pretty photos online, <del><Trans>therefore</Trans></del><ins>and</ins> others can spread the joy with them. 
<del><Mec>Thus</Mec></del><ins>Thus,</ins> I believe that social media sites are <del><ArtOrDet>one of</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> useful tool to help people <del><Wci>known</Wci></del><ins>get to know</ins> each other better. 

However, <del><ArtOrDet>social</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a social</ins> media site is a <del><Wci>double-sided</Wci></del><ins>double-edged</ins> sword<del><Mec>, it</Mec></del><ins>. 
It</ins> also <del><SVA>bring</SVA></del><ins>has</ins> <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> some negative <del><Nn>effect</Nn></del><ins>effects</ins> on our daily life. 
One of the <del><Nn>disadvantage</Nn></del><ins>disadvantages</ins> that many people <del><Vt>concerns</Vt></del><ins>are concerned</ins> <del><Prep>is</Prep></del><ins>about is</ins> that people <del><Wform>loss</Wform></del><ins>lose</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> interest <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> face-to-face communication. 
Many people like to use language to pretend <del><Rloc->themselves</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>, and <del><Vt>lost</Vt></del><ins>lose</ins> confidence when they talk to each other. 
Although not everyone is good at <del><Wci>public</Wci></del><ins>personal</ins> <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> <del><Mec>even</Mec></del><ins>, even</ins> without the existence of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media sites, we cannot deny that <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> do affect some <del><Npos>people</Npos></del><ins>people's</ins> <del><Rloc->in their ability of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> interpersonal skills. 

In conclusion, <del><Wci>the shadow always exists when there is light</Wci></del><ins>everything has its downsides</ins>. 
We should take the advantages of the <del><Wci>creatures</Wci></del><ins>things</ins> we create and try to avoid the negative effects. 
Social media sites <del><Vt>suppose</Vt></del><ins>are supposed</ins> <del><Prep>be</Prep></del><ins>to be</ins> a very useful and convenient tool to <del><Rloc->use and</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> bring people <del><Rloc->get</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> closer in this globalised world. 

The use of social media has <del><Wci>largely</Wci></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many peoplein touchnetworksThanksongreatly</ins> influenced our ways <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> communicating with one another
Online friends <del><Vt>became</Vt></del><ins>have become</ins> real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online. 
Social media <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> changed our ways of exchanging information <del><V0>and</V0></del><ins>and conducting</ins> interpersonal relationships profoundly. 
There are advantages and disadvantages <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> this change. 

Social media <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> reshaped the way <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><WOinc>communication</WOinc></del><ins>we communicate</ins>. 
In real life, we communicate with one another as equal participants. 
We share ideas<del><Trans>,</Trans></del><ins> and</ins> stories and forge <del><Nn>friendship</Nn></del><ins>friendships</ins> based on mutual respect. 
However, communication on social media is largely based on "broadcasting and listening". 
When we use <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> and post pictures and statuses<del><Sfrag>. 
We</Sfrag></del><ins>, we</ins> are actively "presenting" faÃ§ades of our<del><Mec> life</Mec></del><ins>lives</ins>s<del><Prep> in front o</Prep></del><ins>to</ins>f others. 
We tend to post pictures with the best looks,<del><Nn> statu</Nn></del><ins>statuses</ins>s that are funny. 
We broadcast these facades of<del><Pform> u</Pform></del><ins>ourselves</ins>s to others. 
The images we choose to present are<del><Wci> tentativel</Wci></del><ins>carefully</ins>y considered. 
The audience is not some specific person, but everyone we might know, or even the entire world. 
There is an element of seeking<del><Prep> ou</Prep></del><ins></ins>t<del><Prep> fo</Prep></del><ins></ins>r attention rather than expressing one's true opinion on social networks. 
On the other hand, the viewer<del><Rloc->s</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>, are not the listeners. 
They are just scrolling down<del><Rloc-> pages o</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>f pages of pictures and statuses and<del><Vform> se</Vform></del><ins>seeing</ins>e one of them which they might think<del><Rloc-> i</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>t funny. 
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about, but the content. 
This type of communication does not<del><Prep> hel</Prep></del><ins>help with</ins>p forging interpersonal relationships. 
In real life, establishing<del><ArtOrDet> friendshi</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a friendship</ins>p requires the<del><Wform> all-rounde</Wform></del><ins>all-round</ins>d understanding<del><Prep> i</Prep></del><ins>of</ins>n one another and<del><ArtOrDet> th</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins>e caring for one another. 
The latter requires<del><Mec> face to fac</Mec></del><ins>face-to-face</ins>e<del><Mec> interactio</Mec></del><ins>interaction,</ins>n where we can show our emotions to the other. 
One cannot truly understand a person<del><Prep> wit</Prep></del><ins></ins>h only stalking his/her<del><Mec> faceboo</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins>k page where he/she carefully chooses what to present. 
One cannot truly show<del><Pref> thei</Pref></del><ins>one's</ins>r emotions<del><Prep> b</Prep></del><ins>to</ins>y another by texting some =) signs. 

The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships. 
However, it is good for sharing information. 
On social media, everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer. 
With my social network account, I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore<del><Mec>;</Mec></del><ins>,</ins> because I can easily read them from the status of my friends. 
If I am interested in politics, I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures. 
I get news <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>about</ins> sales, clothes and cosmetics from my friends. 
If <del><Wci>some</Wci></del><ins>one</ins> of my friends <del><SVA>have</SVA></del><ins>has</ins> horrible taste <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>in</ins> clothes and he/she posts them often, I can simply block him/her <del><Prep>off</Prep></del><ins></ins>. 
Information <del><Vt>got</Vt></del><ins>gets</ins> circulated. 
The most popular information <del><SVA>get</SVA></del><ins>gets</ins> circulated the <del><Mec>most</Mec></del><ins>most,</ins> so I <del><Rloc->can</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> seldom miss it. 
Social <del><Nn>network</Nn></del><ins>networks</ins> <del><SVA>plays</SVA></del><ins>play</ins> a role in providing and also filtering information. 
This saves a lot of time for me <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> reading newspapers and watching TV. 

<del><Mec>Personally</Mec></del><ins>Personally,</ins> I feel more at ease on social <del><Mec>medias</Mec></del><ins>media</ins>. 
From the above two points of <del><Mec>view</Mec></del><ins>view,</ins> I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships. 
With the help of social media, I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with. 
I also discover some of my friends' <del><Nn>interest</Nn></del><ins>interests</ins> which I find <del><Prep>common</Prep></del><ins>in common</ins> with <del><Mec>myself</Mec></del><ins>myself,</ins> so that talking to one another is much more about life, study, friends, etc. 
The communication does not focus on how we feel, <del><Um>or to say, each otherm,</Um></del><ins></ins> <del><Prep>but</Prep></del><ins>but on</ins> whatever is interesting, or the content. 
In this case, interpersonal <del><Nn>skill</Nn></del><ins>skills</ins> <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody, but to get the information that we are both interested in. 

In conclusion, I think social media <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends, to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest. 
There are advantages and disadvantages in <del><Pref>itself</Pref></del><ins>this</ins><del><Mec>, however</Mec></del><ins>. 
However</ins>, <del><WOinc>whether it is good or bad we are still not sure</WOinc></del><ins>we are still not sure whether it is good or bad</ins>. 
It is just different. 

Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life 
People that <del><Vt>living</Vt></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many peoplein touchnetworksThanksongreatlylive</ins> in the modern world really cannot live without <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media sites like Twitter and Facebook
Almost all students and young adults possess <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> Facebook or Twitter account. 
It is true that social media <del><SVA>makes</SVA></del><ins>make</ins> people <del><Rloc->be</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> able to <del><Prep>connect</Prep></del><ins>connect with</ins> one another more conveniently. 
However, it seems that, especially for some <del><Rloc->those</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>, sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites <del><Vt>become</Vt></del><ins>has become</ins> really necessary. 
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table, but none of them were really chatting with one another. 
Instead, all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this "cheerful" meeting on their social media sites. 
Therefore, there is <del><ArtOrDet>need</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a need</ins> to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media. 

Social media <del><SVA>enables</SVA></del><ins>enable</ins> people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another. 
People used to write letters and send <del><Mec>post cards</Mec></del><ins>postcards</ins> to keep in touch with <del><Wci>ones</Wci></del><ins>people</ins> <del><Vform>live</Vform></del><ins>living</ins> far away from them in the past. 
It <del><Vm>can</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> take a few days or weeks for <del><Pref>those</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> to receive the messages. 
Nowadays, what people need to do is just <del><Vform>typing</Vform></del><ins>type</ins> in front of the computer in their own rooms. 
And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message. 
Distance and time are no longer <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> problems, which is <del><Mec>convenient</Mec></del><ins>convenient,</ins> especially when instant chat is needed. 
However, when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them, their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost. 
Social media <del><SVA>provides</SVA></del><ins>provide</ins> people <del><Prep>a</Prep></del><ins>with a</ins> way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of <del><Wform>communication</Wform></del><ins>communicating</ins>. 
When <del><Pform>ones</Pform></del><ins>one</ins> <del><SVA>chat</SVA></del><ins>chats</ins> on those media sites, there is no eye <del><Wci>connection</Wci></del><ins>contact</ins>, no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of <del><Wform>punctuations</Wform></del><ins>punctuation marks</ins>. 
For more convenience, sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol (which means laugh intensively) and "asap" (which means as soon as possible). 
<del><WOadv>People indeed</WOadv></del><ins>Indeed, people</ins> go to great <del><Nn>length</Nn></del><ins>lengths</ins> to make their words as <del><Wform>shorter</Wform></del><ins>short</ins> as they can. 
<del><Wci>While</Wci></del><ins>Therefore</ins>, <del><Wci>once</Wci></del><ins>when</ins> they are communicating with people <del><Wci>in their face</Wci></del><ins>face to face</ins>, expressing themselves appropriately <del><SVA>become</SVA></del><ins>becomes</ins> <del><WOadv>really a</WOadv></del><ins>a really</ins> big problem. 

Social media also <del><SVA>provides</SVA></del><ins>provide</ins> <del><Prep>people</Prep></del><ins>people with</ins> huge <del><Um>brunch</Um></del><ins></ins> information about people and things that <del><WOinc>they interests</WOinc></del><ins>interest them</ins>. 
For example, on Twitter, it is exciting to follow people that you <del><Mec>adore</Mec></del><ins>adore,</ins> like famous movie and <del><Wci>series</Wci></del><ins>TV</ins> stars, <del><Mec>business men</Mec></del><ins>businessmen</ins> and entrepreneurs. 
It makes people feel <del><Wform>extreme</Wform></del><ins>extremely</ins> close to their <del><Wci>admirers'</Wci></del><ins>idols'</ins> lives and works. 
<del><Wci>Updated</Wci></del><ins>Up-to-date</ins> news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your <del><Mec>smart phones</Mec></del><ins>smartphones</ins> and <del><Mec>laptops</Mec></del><ins>laptops,</ins> almost every time at any time. 
However, after one has registered <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> those social media sites which are not reliable, all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future. 
Furthermore, not everyone on the social media sites is honest. 
The profile picture may not <del><Prep>be</Prep></del><ins>be of</ins> the person <del><Rloc->who</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> that user says he or she really is. 
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to "decorate" his or her face. 
But there is <del><ArtOrDet>possibility</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a possibility</ins> that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to <del><Wci>obtain</Wci></del><ins>use</ins> your information against you. 
<del><Others>No</Others></del><ins>The fact that there is no</ins> <del><Wci>pledge</Wci></del><ins>guarantee</ins> of authenticity risks people's information <del><Rloc->and privacy</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> that <del><SVA>are</SVA></del><ins>is</ins> shared on social media sites. 

To sum up, social media <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> advantages and disadvantages in people's daily life. 
<del><Pref>It</Pref></del><ins>They</ins> <del><SVA>shortens</SVA></del><ins>shorten</ins> the distance between people from all over the world and <del><SVA>makes</SVA></del><ins>make</ins> instant communication possible. 
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media. 
<del><Wci>On the contrary</Wci></del><ins>In contrast</ins>, social media <del><SVA>makes</SVA></del><ins>make</ins> people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and <del><SVA>makes</SVA></del><ins>make</ins> people risk exposing their <del><Wci>privacy</Wci></del><ins>private details</ins> to those whose identity cannot be verified on the social media sites. 

How do social media help change our lives? 
<del><Prep>As</Prep></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many peoplein touchnetworksThanksongreatlyliveWith</ins> the development of <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> technology, social media <del><Wci>becomes</Wci></del><ins>play</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>more</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a more</ins> and more significant role in the whole world
Everyone in the world cannot stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a <del><Mec>log</Mec></del><ins>lot</ins> of other <del><Wtone>stuff</Wtone></del><ins>things</ins> which helps their friends know their lives better. 
However, <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>this</ins> also <del><Vt>raised</Vt></del><ins>raises</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> concerns about whether <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><SVA>brings</SVA></del><ins>bring</ins> us more benefits or a human disaster. 
Although <del><Wci>it</Wci></del><ins>using social media</ins> helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are, <del><WOinc>it at the same time</WOinc></del><ins>at the same time, it</ins> reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to <del><Mec>face</Mec></del><ins>face,</ins> which may affect our interpersonal skills. 
Thus, whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being. 

Many people <del><SVA>says</SVA></del><ins>say</ins> they will support <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media since it really helps them to have a closer view <del><Prep>about</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> how their friends are <del><Wci>going</Wci></del><ins>doing</ins> in other parts of the world. 
This is especially <del><Others>to</Others></del><ins>relevant to</ins> people who are overseas. 
To them, social media is the only resource they can <del><Wci>approach</Wci></del><ins>use</ins> to know everything <del><Vform>happened</Vform></del><ins>happening</ins> in their home country and <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> <del><Wci>way</Wci></del><ins>platform</ins> they can use to show their lives to their <del><Wci>lovers</Wci></del><ins>loved ones</ins> as well. 
What's more, these <del><Mec>days</Mec></del><ins>days,</ins> social media <del><SVA>plays</SVA></del><ins>play</ins> an important role in spreading <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> information. 
Nowadays, people can just easily put their <del><Um>renting information</Um></del><ins></ins> on their <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the <del><Mec>world</Mec></del><ins>world,</ins> which brings us a huge amount of convenience. 
It is quite significant especially for <del><Rloc->those</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> young <del><Mec>teenagers</Mec></del><ins>teenagers,</ins> since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what <del><Vt>happened</Vt></del><ins>is happening</ins> in this world than read the newspaper every day. 

However, there are also a great <del><Wci>amount</Wci></del><ins>number</ins> of people who <del><V0>against</V0></del><ins>are against</ins> this technology. 
They worry a lot about the bad effect on <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Rloc->teenagers</Rloc-></del><ins>teenagers,</ins> who are still developing <del><Rloc->themselves</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>. 
They <del><Vt>pointed</Vt></del><ins>point out</ins> <del><Mec>that</Mec></del><ins>that,</ins> <del><Mec>actually</Mec></del><ins>actually,</ins> social media <del><SVA>reduces</SVA></del><ins>reduce</ins> the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face. 
The more we care about <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins>, the less time we will have to spend with our friends. 
Nowadays, it is quite common to see <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> some party, people <del><Rloc->would more</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> if they feel bored. 
It makes people worry <del><Trans>since</Trans></del><ins>because</ins> if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently, they will decrease <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their</ins> ability to talk to people. 
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other <del><Prep>people</Prep></del><ins>people about</ins>. 

Personally, I strongly agree that social media <del><SVA>brings</SVA></del><ins>bring</ins> more disadvantages compared <del><ArtOrDet>to</ArtOrDet></del><ins>to the</ins> advantages <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><SVA>gives</SVA></del><ins>give</ins> us. 
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life, it wastes <del><Rloc->us</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> a lot of time as well. 
<del><Wci>Think in another way</Wci></del><ins>Put it another way</ins>, if we <del><Wci>put</Wci></del><ins>saved</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>those</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> time we spend on <del><Wci>wandering</Wci></del><ins>browsing</ins> on those sites, we <del><V0>may</V0></del><ins>might</ins> already finish <del><ArtOrDet>one</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> book or do other more meaningful things. 
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> our family or friends. 
Everything <del><Vt>will be</Vt></del><ins>is</ins> bad if we don't know how to use <del><Pref>them</Pref></del><ins>it</ins> <del><Mec>wisely</Mec></del><ins>wisely,</ins> no matter whether it is really good or not. 
As a result, it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media. 

As stated above, I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>them</ins>, we will all live a better life.

Nowadays, as <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> technology is becoming increasingly advanced, more and more social media sites are <del><Wtone>showing up</Wtone></del><ins>appearing</ins> in our daily life. 
You can see people <del><Wci>playing</Wci></del><ins>using</ins> Facebook<del><Trans>,</Trans></del><ins> and</ins> Twitter through their <del><Mec>smart phones</Mec></del><ins>smartphones</ins> or <del><Nn>ipad</Nn></del><ins>iPads</ins> on buses or on trains. 
Some may say that the appearance <del><Prep>for</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> these modern media will reduce the <del><Nn>chance</Nn></del><ins>chances</ins> for people to communicate face to face. 
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society. 

<del><Wform>Firstly</Wform></del><ins>First</ins> of all, social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other. 
Years ago when these modern products <del><Vt>have not been</Vt></del><ins>weren't</ins> popular, the way for people to communicate or contact people far way <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> still restricted <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> making phone calls, sending emails or writing letters. 
Some <del><Rloc->will</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> take <del><ArtOrDet>long</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a long</ins> time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response. 
However, social media <del><SVA>solves</SVA></del><ins>solve</ins> these problems well. 
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very <del><Wci>fast</Wci></del><ins>quickly</ins>. 
The communication is also not limited <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> words. 
People can express themselves through pictures or <del><Wci>emotions</Wci></del><ins>emoticons</ins>. 
People can also get to know their friends' <del><Wci>state</Wci></del><ins>status</ins> and mood by looking at their posts <del><Mec>on line</Mec></del><ins>online</ins>. 
Moreover, people can be aware of what is going on in social <del><Nn>situation</Nn></del><ins>situations</ins> and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites. 
These social media <del><SVA>makes</SVA></del><ins>make</ins> people's <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins> much more colorful and provide a lot of fun. 

However, social media may do some harm to people's <del><Nn>life</Nn></del><ins>lives</ins>. 
<del><Pref>It</Pref></del><ins>They</ins> will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than <del><Spar>communicate</Spar></del><ins>communicating</ins> face to <del><Mec>face</Mec></del><ins>face,</ins> such that <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> interpersonal <del><Nn>skill</Nn></del><ins>skills</ins> will be badly affected. 
Some people spend a lot of time <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> and forget their real life. 
Actually, I have seen <del><Trans>some</Trans></del><ins>that some</ins> people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online. 
However, they <del><Wci>behave</Wci></del><ins>are</ins> quite boring when I talk to them in real life. 
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up. 
If they spend too much time on these social media, it may cause some problems <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> their mental development. 
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face. 
Some may <del><Wci>share </Wci></del><ins>spend</ins><del><Wci>fewer</Wci></del><ins>less</ins> and <del><Wci>fewer</Wci></del><ins>less</ins> time with their family and not <del><Spar>knowing</Spar></del><ins>know</ins> how to express themselves. 
Moreover, some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them. 
Some may even do something wrong. 

In conclusion, the <del><Wci>showing up</Wci></del><ins>appearance</ins> of social media sites is a <del><Mec>double edged</Mec></del><ins>double-edged</ins> sword. 
It can make our life simpler. 
People can <del><Wci>promote</Wci></del><ins>develop</ins> their <del><Nn>friendship</Nn></del><ins>friendships</ins> and <del><Nn>relationship</Nn></del><ins>relationships</ins> through these social media. 
<del><Trans>Whereas</Trans></del><ins>However</ins>, it can also make people forget to communicate <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> their family and friends in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> real life and <del><WOadv>affect negatively</WOadv></del><ins>negatively affect</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> their interpersonal skills. 
But overall, the advantages far outweigh <del><ArtOrDet>its</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> <del><Nn>disadvantage</Nn></del><ins>disadvantages</ins>. 
So we need to make <del><ArtOrDet>best</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the best</ins> use of these social media and make <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring. 
And try to bypass the shortcomings. 
<del><Trans>Remember</Trans></del><ins>And remember</ins> to send greetings to our friends and family frequently. 

Nowadays, with the advancement of technology, it is easy to communicate wherever you are. 
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely. 
People can know their friends' <del><Wtone>recently</Wtone></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many peoplein touchnetworksThanksongreatlyliveWithadvantagesrecent</ins> looks and interesting things <del><Vform>happens</Vform></del><ins>happening</ins> <del><Prep>on</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>that</ArtOrDet></del><ins>those</ins> people just by checking their <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> or other social media sites
We cannot deny that the social media sites truly make <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> old friends <del><Rloc->do</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> not <del><Wci>lose</Wci></del><ins>miss</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> information and <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> chances to communicate with you <del><Trans>even</Trans></del><ins>even if</ins> you are in a different country. 
However, the social media sites truly reduce <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><WOadv>communication in face-to-face</WOadv></del><ins>face-to-face communication</ins> <del><Mec>which</Mec></del><ins>, which</ins> truly affects interpersonal skills. 
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media in <del><Rloc->people's</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> daily life. 

Firstly, the social media sites can <del><WOadv>connect people with their friends and parents closely</WOadv></del><ins>closely connect people with their friends and parents</ins>. 
By typing <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> words and showing <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> pictures, people can express <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> emotions that they are too shy to <del><Others>express</Others></del><ins>express face-to-face</ins>. 
For example, on <del><Mec>mother's day</Mec></del><ins>Mother's Day</ins>, people are <del><Others>shy</Others></del><ins>too shy</ins> to say "I love you" to their <del><Mec>mothers</Mec></del><ins>mothers,</ins> <del><Trans>so</Trans></del><ins>but</ins> they can type it on <del><Pref>his or her</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> mother's <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> page. 
Then <del><ArtOrDet>his or her</ArtOrDet></del><ins>their</ins> mother will also know the emotion and feel warm. 
On the other hand, when <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> teenager is studying in a foreign country, the internet is the only way that he can communicate with <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>his</ins> parents and friends. 
Therefore, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> truly good for people. 

Secondly, the social media sites <del><Wci>can</Wci></del><ins>do</ins> not only <del><WOadv>connect people with their friends closely</WOadv></del><ins>closely connect people with their friends</ins>. 
People can also <del><Wci>know</Wci></del><ins>find out</ins> <del><Wci>much</Wci></del><ins>a lot of</ins> information about <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>celebrity</Nn></del><ins>celebrities</ins> <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> Twitter and Facebook <del><Rloc->such as Obama, Bill Gates</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> and get the <del><Um>first-hand study materials</Um></del><ins></ins> on <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>them</ins>. 
They can <del><Wci>learn</Wci></del><ins>find out</ins> how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous <del><Nn>persons'</Nn></del><ins>people's</ins> <del><Nn>thought</Nn></del><ins>thoughts</ins> by using <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media. 
<del><Wci>On the other hand</Wci></del><ins>In addition</ins>, with the help of social media, some homeless people or someone who <del><SVA>need</SVA></del><ins>needs</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> money to cure <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> disease can get <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> help from the world <del><Mec>quickly</Mec></del><ins>quickly,</ins> because once one person <del><SVA>know</SVA></del><ins>knows</ins> the information, <del><Pform>his</Pform></del><ins>he</ins> or <del><Pform>her</Pform></del><ins>she</ins> will share it <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>with</ins> their "friends area", then many people will know <del><Rloc->it</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> and spread the information to <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Nn>person</Nn></del><ins>people</ins> who can give help. 

On the other hand, there are also problems with the population of the social media. 

Firstly, when people rely on <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media to communicate with their friends and parents, they <del><V0>will</V0></del><ins>will become</ins> <del><Wform>accustom</Wform></del><ins>accustomed</ins> to <del><Vform>communicate</Vform></del><ins>communicating</ins> by typing and not talking. 
People even prefer <del><Vform>talk</Vform></del><ins>talking</ins> to their friends and <del><Vform>meet</Vform></del><ins>meeting</ins> their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication. 
Therefore, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media truly limit <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and <del><Um>connect the relation</Um></del><ins></ins> between <del><Pref>him</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> and their friends. 

Secondly, without <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Wform>truly</Wform></del><ins>true</ins> communication in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> real life, people lose the ability to see the truth and <del><Wci>false</Wci></del><ins>lies</ins>. 
There are many people <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media with beautiful <del><Nn>image</Nn></del><ins>images</ins> and good content <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>on</ins> their pages, <del><Trans>however</Trans></del><ins>but</ins> in real life, he or she may <del><Rloc->do</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> not have <del><Nn>jobs</Nn></del><ins>a job</ins> or <del><V0>live</V0></del><ins>may live</ins> poorly. 
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be <del><Vt>cheat</Vt></del><ins>cheated</ins> and lose <del><Mec>money</Mec></del><ins>money,</ins> <del><Trans>even</Trans></del><ins>or even</ins> their <del><Wform>safe</Wform></del><ins>safety</ins>. 
Therefore, <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> not <del><Mec>safe</Mec></del><ins>safe,</ins> which is bad <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><Nn>teenager's</Nn></del><ins>teenagers'</ins> future development. 

All in all, the <del><Wci>appearance</Wci></del><ins>existence</ins> of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas. 
However, there <del><Mec>exits</Mec></del><ins>exist</ins> some disadvantages which will affect people <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> some degree. 

Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily life and Society. 

Nowadays, with the development of technology and society, social media <del><Vt>become</Vt></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many peoplein touchnetworksThanksongreatlyliveWithadvantagesrecenthave become</ins> more popular and even important in our daily life
We communicate with others using social media, such as <del><Mec>twitter</Mec></del><ins>Twitter</ins>, <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> and microblog more and more frequently. 
There is no need <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins></ins> for people to go out of their home to interact with others<del><Mec>, they</Mec></del><ins>. 
They</ins> chat online, share pictures, tell others what they have done or funny stories. 
It seems that people build a good relationship with others <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>through</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> social media, but <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> problems <del><Wci>come out</Wci></del><ins>arise</ins>. 
<del><Mec>Pepope</Mec></del><ins>People</ins> do not know how to talk with others face to face, especially <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> strangers. 
<del><Trans>Then</Trans></del><ins>Therefore</ins>, we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in <del><ArtOrDet>your</ArtOrDet></del><ins>our</ins> daily life and society. 

As for the advantages, there are two aspects: more convenient to contact others, easier to know about others. 

One advantage is that it is more <del><Wform>convenience</Wform></del><ins>convenient</ins> to contact others by social media. 
In <del><ArtOrDet>old</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the old</ins> days, if one <del><Vt>wants</Vt></del><ins>wanted</ins> to tell some important news to <del><Pref>another one</Pref></del><ins>someone</ins><del><Rloc->,</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> <del><Pref>which</Pref></del><ins>who</ins> lives far away, <del><Pref>he</Pref></del><ins>one</ins> <del><Vt>needs</Vt></del><ins>needed</ins> to write letters and <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>that</ins> wastes time. 
The long distance and <del><Wci>time-consuming</Wci></del><ins>delay</ins> <del><Vt>make</Vt></del><ins>made</ins> <del><Wci>spreading </Wci></del><ins>sending</ins><del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> messages very difficult at that time. 
Therefore, people <del><Vm>may</Vm></del><ins>did</ins> not contact <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> faraway friends and relatives unless there <del><Vt>are</Vt></del><ins>was</ins> something important. 
However, people <del><WOadv>now can</WOadv></del><ins>can now</ins> contact <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins></ins> anyone all over the world who can use <del><ArtOrDet>computer</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a computer</ins> at any time, and there is no time delay <del><Prep>of</Prep></del><ins>to</ins> messages. 

The other advantage is that it is easier to <del><Wci>know</Wci></del><ins>find out</ins> about others <del><Prep>by</Prep></del><ins>through</ins> social media. 
If there <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>were</ins> no social media, it <del><Vt>is</Vt></del><ins>would be</ins> difficult for people to <del><Wci>know</Wci></del><ins>find out</ins> about a stranger. 
They <del><Vm>may</Vm></del><ins>could</ins> collect information about that person by asking <del><Pref>his</Pref></del><ins>their</ins> friends, colleagues or family members. 
And the information collected <del><Vm>may</Vm></del><ins>might</ins> not be <del><Wci>intact</Wci></del><ins>complete</ins> and true. 
Unlike today, with the help <del><Prep>with</Prep></del><ins>of</ins> social media, people can easily get the information they want just by searching <del><Mec>on line</Mec></del><ins>online</ins>, and know about what that person <del><Vt>did</Vt></del><ins>does</ins> <del><Mec>everyday</Mec></del><ins>every day</ins> <del><Trans>at</Trans></del><ins>and at</ins> what time. 

As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life, <del><Others>wasting</Others></del><ins>these include wasting</ins> time, causing illness related to sitting <del><ArtOrDet>long</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a long</ins> time <del><Prep>before</Prep></del><ins>in front of</ins> the computer, <del><Wci>quick-spread</Wci></del><ins>the rapid spreading</ins> of rumor and fake news, <del><Trans>most</Trans></del><ins>and most</ins> importantly, making people <del><Vform>lost</Vform></del><ins>lose</ins> the ability to talk to others <del><WOadv>face to face confidently</WOadv></del><ins>confidently face to face</ins>. 
It is weird that people sit around <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> table but all <del><Wci>face</Wci></del><ins>look</ins> <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>at</ins> their phones and do not talk with each other. 
If there is a joke on their <del><Mec>facebook</Mec></del><ins>Facebook</ins> page, they may talk to others in this way<del><Mec>,</Mec></del><ins>:</ins> "hi, look, how ridiculous this is"<del><Mec>, then</Mec></del><ins>. 
Then</ins> they laugh together. 
No matter <del><Trans>it</Trans></del><ins>whether it</ins> is a party, dinner or <del><ArtOrDet>just</ArtOrDet></del><ins>just a</ins> <del><Wform>simply</Wform></del><ins>simple</ins> get-together, there <del><WOadv>always are</WOadv></del><ins>are always</ins> some people <del><Vform>bow</Vform></del><ins>bowing</ins> their head and <del><Prep>playing</Prep></del><ins>playing with</ins> their <del><Mec>phones</Mec></del><ins>phones,</ins> <del><Trans>even</Trans></del><ins>even if</ins> their family and friends are in front of them. 

In <del><ArtOrDet>a</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life. 
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while <del><Vform>be</Vform></del><ins>being</ins> aware of the disadvantages <del><Rloc->of that</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> and try their best to avoid the disadvantages <del><Vform>happen</Vform></del><ins>happening</ins> to them and their friends and family. 

Today <del><Rloc->world</Rloc-></del><ins>After alla closeAanmade withwhether it be aas to whetherofhaving aa geneticrecentsociety,inA personA carriertell?their relatives.illnessesidentifyplayskills,has helpedworldfacilitatedthe newsfallwidespreadagreatly improves the lives of many peoplein touchnetworksThanksongreatlyliveWithadvantagesrecenthave become</ins> is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and <del><Mec>Twitter</Mec></del><ins>Twitter,</ins> which are attractively connecting people around the world
However, some people worry that social <del><Wform>network</Wform></del><ins>networking</ins> can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact. 
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society are elaborated on <del><Wci>as follows</Wci></del><ins>below</ins>. 

Nobody can deny social media's advantages <del><Prep>as</Prep></del><ins>in view of</ins> the benefit <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>they</ins> <del><SVA>provides</SVA></del><ins>provide</ins> in connecting people regardless of nationalities, races, cultures and languages. 
Social media <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> a trending channel and a suitable <del><Nn>mean</Nn></del><ins>means</ins> of <del><Nn>communications</Nn></del><ins>communication</ins>. 

Firstly, social media <del><SVA>brings</SVA></del><ins>bring</ins> convenience to the world. 
<del><Pref>It</Pref></del><ins>They</ins> <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> erased the boundaries of distance and time. 
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages. 
Nowadays, thanks to <del><Rloc->the help of</Rloc-></del><ins></ins> social media, with just one click, you can contact your family and friends <del><Wci>wherever</Wci></del><ins>whenever</ins> you want. 
You can share photos, videos and every meaningful <del><Nn>experiences</Nn></del><ins>experience</ins> of your life. 
More importantly, it is cheap and easy to use social media. 

Secondly, <del><ArtOrDet>social</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a social</ins> media network opens the door of opportunities for people due to its great benefit <del><Prep>in </Prep></del><ins>of</ins><del><Others>connecting</Others></del><ins>connecting people</ins>. 
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter. 
Young people can widen their relationships, meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world. 
In business <del><Rloc->area</Rloc-></del><ins></ins>, social media <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> a good tool to develop and advertise products and services. 

On the other hand, social media also <del><SVA>has</SVA></del><ins>have</ins> disadvantages which have created worries <del><Prep>to</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon. 
More and more young people tend to live in <del><ArtOrDet>social</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the social</ins> media world most of <del><ArtOrDet>their</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the</ins> time and reduce face-to-face human contact, which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life. 

First and foremost, we should realize that <del><ArtOrDet>social</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the social</ins> media world is not trustworthy and real. 
Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want. 
They can become anyone. 
Though social media do create relationships, relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>through</ins> face-to-face interaction. 
There is a story of a girl who <del><Vt>lives</Vt></del><ins>lived</ins> in <del><ArtOrDet>social</ArtOrDet></del><ins>the social</ins> media world every night <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> eight years. 
In the chat room, she created a close relationship with eight people. 
She talked with them every night, <del><Vt>trust</Vt></del><ins>trusted</ins> them and <del><Vt>share</Vt></del><ins>shared</ins> her life with them. 
Then eventually, she discovered that <del><ArtOrDet>eight</ArtOrDet></del><ins>those eight</ins> people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time. 

Furthermore, the convenience of social media is also its weakness. 
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites, which can lead to crimes and deception. 
People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks to do bad things such as blackmail, ATM theft and so on. 

Last but not least, social media <del><SVA>does</SVA></del><ins>do</ins> affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites and reject chances to <del><Pref>expose</Pref></del><ins>expose themselves</ins> to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people. 
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites, the less they become ambitious. 
As a result, if the situation <del><SVA>keep</SVA></del><ins>keeps</ins> <del><Wci>go on</Wci></del><ins>following</ins> <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins></ins> this unexpected trend, it will <del><Wci>cause</Wci></del><ins>have</ins> a bad effect on the <del><Wform>young</Wform></del><ins>younger</ins> generation. 

<del><Wtone>To put it in the nutshell</Wtone></del><ins>In summary</ins>, everything has its own pros and cons<del><Trans>. 
So </Trans></del><ins>, and so</ins><del><SVA>does</SVA></del><ins>do</ins> social media <del><Nn>network</Nn></del><ins>networks</ins>. 
It <del><WOinc>not only is</WOinc></del><ins>is not only</ins> convenient and beneficial <del><Prep>in</Prep></del><ins>for</ins> connecting people and developing <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins></ins> <del><Mec>business</Mec></del><ins>business,</ins> but it also can damage <del><Npos>people</Npos></del><ins>people's</ins> relationships and interpersonal skills. 
Social media <del><SVA>is</SVA></del><ins>are</ins> only beneficial as long as we know how to use <del><Pref>it</Pref></del><ins>them</ins> in a correct and suitable way with <del><ArtOrDet>the</ArtOrDet></del><ins>a</ins> combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people's potentials to the fullest.
