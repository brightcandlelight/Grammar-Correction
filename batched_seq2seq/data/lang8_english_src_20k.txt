I will appreciate it if you correct my sentences
It's been getting colder these days here in Japan
The summer weather in Japan is not agreeable to me with its high humidity and temperature
So, as the winter is coming, I'm getting to feel better
It is the very exciting season
But, before enjoying those kind of happy time, I have to do a kind of boring, 
I have a fiancee and she is finding her job
It seems not easy to find a job for women in Japan
The first, most women have baby and they have to take maternity leave
Employers don't like it even if maternity leave is the right for employees
The second,  women workers likely to quit their job because of child care or the transfar of ther husbands
If a woman worker quit her job, employers have to find a new employee
Though there are many women workers who have excellent potentil, employers often hesitate to hire them
It was first time
When I was arrived in Brisbane, it was always sunny
I am missing warm weather
Its too hard for me
My goal is an overall 7.0, but it may need to more than 1 year
English is the harder , the more difficult
I really hope that I speak English seems to native
Also, I have another problem
I always practice pronounce, but getting more difficult
I dont know why I cant recognize \"ea\" \"i\" ,such as, \"cheap as chips
If I said that sentence, people will be heard same pronounciation
2 months later, I am going to back to Korea
I just learnt alphabet
It’s said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japanese’s, so that the Korean who study Japanese just have to take about 1year to speak Japanese fluently, while the other foreigners have to take 3,4 years or more than so 
I found that the Korean’s alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese’s
How about the way of spell
And after I entered the Japanese department, I even can’t recall any English’s grammars that I’d learnt before
But it’s also said that it’s very difficult to learn well both of them
One time, I had an Japanese examination
The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before when see a katakana word, we just try to think of an English word and then spell it
I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reasons
Then I asked my brother for an advice, he said that “I like Japanese
I was acquainted with him in a Chinese’s room chat when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago
He is very special person, even though we’ve met in real life yet
He is 8 years older than me but he just likes a friend
He is very humorious and handsome 
He can always make me smile even when I’m in bad mood
But in my university, at the second year of regular training, we can choose a second qualifications if we want and sure that we’ll be able to study well both
My university has about 11 foreign language’s departments and some other department where teach economics, travel bussiness, computer and so on… If we’re learning a foreign language, we’re advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness’s department so that when we graduate we will have a best job
So next year, I intend to choose English department for the second qualifications
And when we’re at the third year, we have a compulsory subject
It’s differ from the second qualifications
Because the second qualifications  also has economics, travel bussiness, computer… training and it isn’t compulsory
For example, I’m learning Japanese, I have to choose one in 10 other foreign languages remained
So, if next year I choose the English department, the year after I maybe choose Korean for second foreign language
To learn almost Japanese, we have 4 years
After that, it’s not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently
It’s called “love’s language”, isn’t it
Do you know our Uncle Ho who was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages
I can’t do like that but I wish I could learn at least 4: Japanese, English, Korean and French
Do I have the ability to do
I’m very worry about it
This time  we still have to test 4 Japanese’s skill
I’m very nervous of speaking and listening skill
It was so bad, wasn’t it?And the essay’s topic this time will be random
I’ll have to write anything in Japanese as topic’s request
And life is short
This is try hard
We wore wedding dress despite the absence of our bridegrooms
Wish best wishes for her
That is my mother’s pictures which were taken when she was young

There is a big difference between the east and the west, when comes to education,i always admired how the westerner educate their posterity,their method is so gentle and kind,full of love and meaning,whereas the asian method is rather more of violence,for example the chinese people believe that a child should be educated with rods
countless beating from their parent is believe to be capable of forging a successful child!thats how i was brought up at least, my parent always tell me how much they love me although they served me with rod every time i commit a wrongdoing,however when comes to the western way of parenting,it sounds like a fairy tale to me,for example the western parent always said this to their child if they happened to be repudiate, the parent will say this\" go to your room!\" this is something that will never happen in an asian family
May be our parent would never realize the trauma they had inflicted on us
how successful was the league of nations in establishing peace during the 1920s
The league of nations is an organization form to improve lives and jobs of the people around the world,settle peace by disarmament ,and to uphold and enforce the treaty of Versailles
The league was successful in establishing peace during 1920s through discouraging aggression to other countries by negotiation ,the Lon also plan to provide collective security by a community of power,example silesia,where the league settle a dispute between germany and poland through plebiscite,another example is the aaland where under lon's investigation settle a dispute between sweden and finland,the league is also successful in improving the life of people,for example they provide direct aid and welfare to the people in need around the world,one of the famous act is the repatriation of 400000 ww1 prisoners and employ them to kill mosquitos to prevent malaria and also prevent leprosy,they also provide economic experts to help Austria and Hungary as well as establishing the international labour organization
As three of the most powerful nations in the world do not participate in the lon they are germany
russia and united state,the two most powerful countries in lon britain and france wanted to recover their economic loss in ww1 so they show no enthusiastic to get involve,the league fail to establish disarmament,first in 1923 and second in 1931 both fail because britain and germany,however they did arrange a conference in 1928 the kellog-briand pact which was an act of league assembly sign by 23 nations and supported by 65 countries and which outlawed war
however they are unsuccessful because most of their disarmament  were not achieve
the greatest achievement of the league is the social issue no organization had ever do it before ,until now their war has been taken over by the U
N so it is a great success,however it fail to stop powerful countries starting a war,fail to establish disarmament,also fail to defend the treaty of Versailles ,these give rise to aggression by axis power
Now It's snowing in Tokyo 
When I was a child, I liked snowing

Qin urged Paris to stop interfering in China's internal affairs,and immediately correct its wrongdoing
This move by the Paris government gravely damaged the city's image among the Chinese, Qin said
A poll on the website of the Global Times found more than 87 percent of voters firmly opposed the Paris move
Paris should bear all the blame, Qin said, urging Paris to takethe right attitude towards the Chinese people's voice, and stop its offence to the Chinese people, in a bid to create an essentialcondition for the cooperation with Chinese cities

I rode from the bike shop to home on it right after I purchased
It was 30 minutes ride
It was great to ride roadway
There weren't any bumpy things, so I could go really fast
But I often had to stop and turn my face back because there were so many taxis cars parking on the streets
My bike doesn't have a stand, so I lifted it up and brought it in front of my apartment which is on the 3rd floor
The frame is aluminum made, so it is light as a feather

I bought a sleeping bag
From now on, I can stay up all night in the lab comfortably
No more arranged chairs
The love and the Japanese language
Japanese, however, hadn't have the proper word which signifies \"love\" because of the sensibilities and lyricism
When one of his students put \"I love you\" into Japanese as ”私はあなたを愛しています\", he warned him against that translation
Japanese should put it into like  \"今夜は月が綺麗ですね\"(which means \"The moon looks more beautiful tonight\") instead
I think what he meant was that \"love\" is the feeling that makes the moon looks brighter than the moon you see by yourself
Previously of my last journal entries

Nonetheless I felt shakiness in my house
I pray for that damages won't extend any more
I experienced so many things which were beyond possibility in Japan
And now she is a freshmen of Luther College
I had never ridden a bullet train for a while
So I was worried about if I could see her
Today was the first day of this school year of the lab I belong
This is the Website of the lab
The regions of research of this laboratory are Electric Power Equipment and High Electric Field phnemenon
I'm in my 4th year of Nagoya University now
I'm inexperienced and my competence for reseaching is not enough
So I am going to knock myself out to learn as many as possible from great professors and seniors
My dream is to be a professor of the reagion of Electric Power Equipment and Asset management
To realize my dream, I must do my possible
I hope everyone had a great day of Christmas
The name of band is \"celandaine
He is a lead vocalist of the band
And he also write songs for the band
They have been awarded the first prize of a band competition which was all teenage bands in Japan could enter
So I am not sure if that name means properly
Today I went to the YFU meeting for the long-term staying overseas students
They arrived here 2 month ago
And they are leaving this winter
He could write the kanji of \"鬱
We talked about why they decided to come to Japan and what they like of Japan
Most said that they really love the food of Japan
Fortunately, the exhibition of the Japanese art was held on the same floor of where we were having the meeting
And it was for free to admit
So I took everyone into the exhibition
So if you blow it, it will be destroyed
And he took the pictures of us for free
And then they treated us to matcha and cha-gashi by courtesy of them
It was the really good experience
And I really appreciate their many kindness to us
I cought a cold
I got a cold
So I take a day off to write a journal entry
Good night everyone
I'm going to bed
I don't like rainy season
Many individuals believe that nuclear power plants are considerable danger
The Chernobyl disaster left unforgettable damages due to the explosion of the plant and release of the radiation
Many countries, however, decided to reconsider of nuclear power plant development
So I wrote few lines along the textbook
It was really hard to write as Academic writing
But if I keep writing like this, I think I will get good score at the TOEFL test
Don't you think so
The weather forecast said the rain will go on for this week
I think it's a little bit early to set in the rainy season
I'm thinking to mange my daily schedules in English
I'm thinking to manage my daily schedules in English
So would you tell me how people usually write them on their notebooks
9:00～12:00 Group Discussiong of Hanai group at IB Room 101

How' do you think
I bettered my own record of  TOEIC
The day before yesterday, the result of the 153th TOEIC test was announced on the internet
The score of the TOEIC will be converted into the score of the English
And 905 points will be converted to 100 out of 100
What I meant is I am finally ready to concentrate upon the entrance examination of the graduate school 
We hold a 2 day orientation oft YFU exchange student program
I met some former friends at high school
We talked about our senses of value
And we talked about our future career
My grandpa finally passed away
I am going to see the cherry blossams with my lab members and professors
I was transfered to the 3rd grade of Nagoya University from Toyota National College of Technology last year
So last year I experienced my first campas life
At the bigginning of the school year, I had almost no friend in the university
But now I am aurrounded by many friends, senors and juniors
I recieved so many greetings yesterday
From friends, familiy, friends in US, host family and so on
Those mede me realized I had been supported by so many people
And those gave me plenty of push
I am going to set about the math section of the entrance examination for graduate school tomorrow
It's been 2 month since my last journal
Time flies very fast
I've been through so many stimulative experiences these days
But this margin is too small to contain
Fermat's phrase
I've been sticking on my graduation research, staying overnight in the lab twice a week
But finally I'm realizing the fun of research
Going to a Amusement park with exchange students
I had to do so many tough stuffs like having a presentation in front of all of the lab members and professors
But they never remain in my brain
I feel like I just content myself with reading English, but I learned nothing
I guess I need to put more stress on English
The centerpiece of the rides is the roller coaster called \"Steel Dragon
It was on the Guinness Book as the world's tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster
Some of them were broken
I am not good at  scream machines
But one of them who is from Michigan really likes those kind of things
So I was dragged to them
I chickened right in front of its platform once
I had been having a prejudice for a long time
It was way much funner than I thought
It's been a while since last time I wrote my journal
Sorry about I haven't been able to give you any help for a month
But I'm done with all exams
This means beginning of 2 months of spring break
I'm trying to write a jounal at least once in a 3 days
And I'll try to give you what help I can
By the way, I found beautiful lines written by Miyazawa Kenji
But I don't know how to put it into English
Flowers raining in the sky, we call them star
Stars shines on the earth, we call them flower
Something like this
What Japanese government said and what foreign press said differed in many accounts
Maybe Japanese government has been trying to control information to avoid panic
But this backfired
Many people are disarrayed
Tokyo Electric Power Company was one of the most secured large companies
But that day, it fell off
Nothing is certain
In addition to the my last journal, my birthday is placed at the end the season of that cherry trees are in full blossom
I went out to the park with my friends to enjoy a picnic under the cherry blossoms on my birthday
The park was congested  with many people
So it was not like enjoying the tasteful gardens
But people were having fun with beer bottles in their hands and the foods of stalls
As the time rolls on, people are losing their hearts to love the nature
But they still have hearts to love and enjoy having fun with friends
this is not what I was going to write
So see you then
【PR】My best friend's band is releasing the major debut album on 4\/21
He is a one of my best friends
We went to the same school and had been in a same class for five years
I've written a journal about him and his band a while ago
At that time, I asked you for some help for the name of the major debut album in behalf of him
He hopse his songs will be your fire and warm your heart
Enjoying our lives is important thing
But while we live in each nations, there are responsibilities and obligations
I really reflect on myself about this
The subject was \"Is it possible that each of the people all over the world uses the same amount of energy that a Japanese uses now
At no distant date, the time may come when people will have used up all the oil
But if the blade is damaged by lightning and need replacement, the wind must be slight enough to undertake the construction work safely
This means that operating a wind power generator requires constant and powerful wind but it must stop periodically
So I think I should go to bed a bit than earlier tonight
I will write more about the energy problem sometime not distant date
I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning
So I had to finish it tonight and leave him to turn it tomorrow morning
I haven't had dinner yet
Sorry about I've been unable to correct your journals these days.(´；ω；｀
So correcting your journal entries from that computer is really hard to do.(´・ω・
So I'm thinking to bring the laptop computer which I usually use at home to the lab, and leave it for some time
Furthermore, my graduation research could be a kind of simulation stuff, I think
Don't you think so
But I decided to do it to save my money
But it's gonna be much more powerful than ones made by manufacturers
I'm thinking to use some wire shelfs which I've kept outside
They are covered with rust so bad
I have the BBQ and hiking this weekend
I guess this gonna take a while
I didn't have a refrigerator
So I used to take meals at school cafeteria or just buy some convenience food
And by gigantic city, I mean it's Tokyo
Feng-Sui derives from Chinese long time ago
But It had been used  in Japan since medieval times for a long time
And the queer monk, 天海, rearranged whole city of Edo under the Feng-Shui's doctrine
To make a long story short, he changed the names of places around the castle
He also placed many temples and Japanese style garden under the Feng-Sui
Many of Japanese are not aware of it
I was at the \"Tacos Paty\" last night
All participants works for YFU as a volunteer
The second picture is of the hadmade tiramisu
One of them had the birthday recently
It was tacos party but also her birthday party
It's been a week since last time I wrote a jounal
Last Thursday, I was present at the party
That party was aimed for learnig English conversation
This kind of parties are held periodically
But this was my first time to take part in
And I waited them about 30 minutes under the cold wether
We could drink as much drinks as we want
I drunk litters of Gin Tonic
We only had English conversations
But also it was fun to talk with Japanese who are interested in English
I forgot about that this was my firtst time and enjoyed speaking English
Those pictures were taken at there
I am the guy who is accidentally kissing with 42 old guy in the second picture.) 
Around 22:30, people started leaving if not they were missing the last trains
Then wemoved to next place
We walked about 10 or 20 minutes with a straggeringly
We talked about many funny things (mostly indecent things) at there
We stayed at there until morning
I have TOEIC test in a months
I didn't  write a jounal enry last night.ｐ(≧ヘ≦。)ｑ
But the computer which is provided for me by the lab was really slow
I tried to uninstall some applications and did a virus check
It took couple hours
Then workshop started
When I got to home, it was past 10 p.m. (＞、＜
I still could wirte a jounal but I was too exhasted
I need to be more steadily
And sleeps only a hour
He says his bed is too comfortable
He might sleep more than a hour if he sleeps in the bed
I don't know if a hour is enough for me
I feel proud of Japan
I also feel sad for the losses of those culture
The Golden Week starts tomorrow
There are many different theories regarding what motivetes human being to act in the ways in the what they do
I agree with the latter position because all human activities have something to do with society which embrace the other people
Ultimately any kind of human actions are mold by affection to others
And I'm in the middle of the section about \"Introduction.\" hehe
Now I'm wring a paper about the currents state and futere prospects of the energy suppry in Japan
I'm examining the renewable energy and the nuclear power
The more I learn, the more obvious that the development of the nuclear power plant is reasonable
I don't think I could write what I intended properly
But, \"Haste makes wastes!\",\"Stay calm!\" and \"Be cool
Most of people say Eminem is one of the coarsest rappers in history of music because of his behavior, words and his songs which are studded with insults
He has put affronts upon many celebrities in his songs such as Michel Jacson, Elvis Presley and even his ex-wife
A song which is in his 3rd album, however, shows those of his insults might be not his real intention
This song which you might heve not heard of is named \"Hailie's Song
Hailie\" is his daughter's name
Please turn off or put your cellphone into silent mode while the show
the \"Hailie's song
There is a huge forest which no one can trespass on its holy ground in the middle of the capital city which is well-known worldwide
The priest is a direct descendant of the the world oldest dynasty, and he is also the only emperor now exists in the whole world
There are three holly durables called \"The Three Sacred Treasures
Those are owned by the emperor and have been succeed from generation to generation
Each of them is guarded closely at the ancient sanctuaries and they are regarded untouchable
The gigantic city itself has also been closely protected by layered magics by an sublime wizard since it was established
So it is an artificial magic-defensed city
It is unprecedented scale and any other such city is no longer exist, even in the the cradle of the magic
I hate sea shepard
I feel like they are doing such things just for fun
First thing I want to insist is there is no difference between whale and cow
Biologicaly they are both classified as mumal
Do you think it can be as a reason to not kill it
We have the culture to appliciate all lives equally
April 1st is the day which called April Fools' Day
But I am not going to be fool in this journal
April is the biginning of school season
I graduated Nagoya University and got the degree of Bachelor of Engineering last month
Now I'm going graduate school of Nagoya University
I learned many things during last year
They were not only special knowledges
My aim of this year is \"learn a lot and play a lot\" by efficient time management
I'm finally over with midterms
Finally the mid-terms are done now
But not for this year
This year, it means, finally I can focus on my research
My research is about the optimization of the maintenance strategy of electrical equipments
I have no idea how to solve this yet
I have only 5 month to finish this
So I have no time to repose
I haven't touched my electrical dictionary these days
This means I haven't used English these days
Learning English is not avoidable for my future
I have to spend more time with English
It had been really cold until last week
In the meddle of April, It's usually warm enough to go out with wearing only a long-sleeved shirt or sometimes casual jacket on it in here
But the day of last week, it was so cold that I needed to wear a down jacket even it's already spring
Today, the professor of the energy trasnsforming engineering class tould us some doubt of global warming
He described it from the viewpoints of the number of the sunspots, the axis of the earth and the earth's yearly round
He said that the earth is facing the global cooling now
He said it will cause a serious cool summer all over the world
The wether forecast said tomorrow gonna be cold
I just can't wait the nice warm spring
We took part in it as the YFU which is the exchange organization that took care of me while I was staying in America
I had been told that we were supposed to explain the activities of the YFU to students  who were interested in studying abroad
We have held such a meeting last month
So we supposed that this was bound to go easily
But it wasn't
Actually this event was a kind of extracurricular activities
There were a lot of other organizations such as the group of Japanese drum players, the welfare workers and the rival organization whose name is AFS
But all of them were mostly for people who want to study abroad
So the contents of slide show which we prepared were mostly about how to apply the YFU exchange program, the history of the YFU and the structure of the organization
So it was a serious type thing and wasn't a fun thing at all
The rival organization, AFS, was doing really fun thing
We totally mistook the purport of the event
We were feeling like lying on the bed of thorns
Last Saturday, we hold a Christmas Party for exchange students
There are nine exchage students staying in this Tokai area through YFU
YFU is the one of the world's largest exchange organization
I've been staying in America for a year as a exchange student 3 years ago through YFU
I really appreciate to Them
So, to replay and express my feeling of gratitude, I'm working for YFU as a volunteer now
These exchange students are returning to their homeland at the beginning of next month
So we wanted them to have one more another precious memory of Japan
This was why we held the christmas party
About the place for party hall, a gentleman who also has the exchange experience through YFU runs a cafe at midtown Nagoya and he let us to use it for the Party
That is really nice place
It consists of nice interiors and cool drawings are painted all over the walls
Maybe these are drawn by themselves
On the very day of the Christmas Party, it was lovly,over 30 people came
There were foreign exchange students,their friends and rest of them were belong to from my age to older even over 50
We entertained them for many snacks ,juices and Japanese traditional food Temaki-Sushi
We had the game named \" Russian roulette wasabi cream puff
Wasabi is Japanese horserasish
It is really pungent
After game,we enjoyed chatting with each other and the hall kept ranging with the sound of laughter
One of the exchange students had a birthday just on that day
So we celebrate her 17th birthday with so-cute birthday cake
I hope we could make unforgettable memory for them
I wish, finally,I want to pay everyone who helped to meke such successful Party my best compliment
I parked on the street around the university
And where I parked was only 2 meters away from the crossroad
I have to pay the penalty of it.｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡
The fine of illigal parking is ￥18000
This is so expensive
But I have to accept that, otherwise I will get arrested
Oh man, If I didn't commit, I could buy an another monitor and a graphic board
Oh, and just in case, I will upload the picture of the area that you are not allowed to park
Be careful when you park your car on the road
Last week we recieved a health screening report
It showed some unusual numerical value
And doctor said he has the metastasis spread of cancer of all around his body
Doctor also said his days are numbered, 3 month at most
I'm really proud of him
He has been helping my life
When I hoped to study abroad in America, he was the one who approved and paid whole expenses
He also paid my tuition fees, and what's more he is saving to prepare for my graduate school fees
When I get back from 1year studying abroad, I visited my grandparents first
He looked at me at onece ,and suddenly he stormed about my hair color
Can you yell to your grandson you see after an interval of a year
He couldn't overlook that I seemed like I changed the identity and lost my pride in beeing Japanese
So neext day, I had my hair cut really short, and colored my hair black
Then I visit them again and apologized
Because I think it is Japanese identity
He brought up me
I had never faced such situation, someone who is really close to me is dying before
At first, I kinda lost my grasp of what I was facing
I couldn't thought with what I should tell him
Strangely enough I hadn't been terribly grieved this week
Because I was too busy at my university stuff and other work I'm responsible for it
I really appriciate what he had given to me
And his inmost thoughts are living in me
Of course I wann't going to cry
I was rather going to relieve him
When I see him and his gaunt face, I couldn't check the flow of tear
I realized what I'm facing, he is passing away
I couldn't tell him what I was going to tell well because tears kept interefering
And also I realized I can not possibly put my gratitude into words
I vowed to work as much as I can and contribute to the world to his face
Beyond that, I only could tell him \" Thank you for everyghing, everyghing you gave to me.\"  And I left his house with saying \" See you later
If I die tomorrow, I would feel I couldn't put what he had gave to me to account enough
So I decided to try to take more oppotunities to tell my friedns, my jouniors and you who is reading my diary what I learned until now
And I'll try harder to leave more things to this world
I represents my honorable grandpa
I should never disgrace his honor
Today I had my third time of the English conversation class
We talked about the article, \"Asian youth forgetting how to write
First we were given a paper which is written the article but some sentences are blanked
Then the teacher read the article to us
And we filled out the blanks
What is your favorite pan?(ﾉ´∀｀
Oh, there is a home work due next week
Then it hit me
Does anyone know this one??(；´Д｀
My favorite one is, \"There was a sign on the lawn at a drug re-hab center that said 'Keep off the Grass
Today I went to the Atsuta shrine and the Shiratori Japanese style garden
A Shinto shrine is a structure which is made as the house of kami-sama
It's placed in a hour from my house but I had never been there
As you see in the picture, that was really, really beautiful
t I felt like \"the true colors of Japan\" was there
The second picture is the oldest bridge in Nagoya
There are some rules about paying homage at a shrine
2 You have to walk left side of the road because its center is for the kami-sama to walk
Then tap your hands twice , bow and wish your desire in your heart
At this point, you shouldn't speak your wish in voice
These are some of conventions of Shinto
But I saw many people didn't follow them
Japanese style gardens are often made in imitation of the real scenery
And this is the biggest Japanese style garden in Nagoya which imitated the scenery of this area
It has quaint atmosphere
I think leaves of the trees will turn in autumn and it must be really beautiful
It's been 2 days since I met you, my brain is full of you
Because if I touch you I think everything I've established gonna collapse
That fear alienate you
If I've got on you in my birthday suit, 
with holding by you until the moon sets over the sea, and share the panorama of the color of the sky
I would've not feeling this gloom
How many times will I have sleepless nights
I cannot concentrate on anything but I'm just more in love with you
dear my new bed
I'm not in good shape
This morning I woke up with the horrible stomachache
So I ran into the bathroom as soon as I left the bed
I don't feel good since last Saturday
This happens periodically
It's like the air is being thin only around me
I can't center my focus on the studying
I made a rule! 
On the day of my birthday, I made a rule to never fail to write a jounal everyday
This was way I was in haste last night
It is the biggest priority for me to make good on my promises
But I will keep up
I will try to be undaunted
Now it's 12:30 in Japan now
I don't know what else to say
It might be the best movie I've ever watched
I have watched many movies
But I had never watched such movie before
So I don't know how to remark on it
Actually, Radiohead’s Last Flowers is used as an overture for the film
I've heard the news that Hollywood is remaking it with Daniel Radcliffe and Nicole Kidman
I'm sure it will fall
Because I'm sure that it is impossible to make this movie except for Japanese
What I'm trying to say is, even if you are a great chef, you can't make a dish of Japanese cuisine with American seasoning
Ah, I cannot express my feeling well
There is only one thing that I am clear of it
It is I am glad that I could watch this movie
After we had lunch at 矢場とん, we went to the Nagoya Castle
Perhaps I had been there before, I didn't remember anything of it
It looked with reality
Then we moved to 栄 and went to the restaurant which serves cake buffet
They served more than 15 kinds of cakes and we could eat as many as we want
They serve cream puffs, custard puddings, short cakes, and many other cakes which I had never seen before
The clerks ,customers and everyone in the house sang birthday song toghether
We had plenty of cakes and great time
Then we took 名無しさん and Porschla to the bus station and they departured to Takayama
They had a free day in Nagoya because the flight reserved would departure this afternoon

I feel tired the last few days
Our school's rock club declared that I become next year the activities leader of rock club
I have to host our club's activity of Sea Music Festival
A lots of things around me :club,schoolwork,relationships,activity
I feel so tired and I cried several times
I don't have time to do myself
How can I do
I feel so depression
how to make friends
When i am young,I find it's very easy to make a new friend
However,it's more and more hard now
Why?,I think it is because of the lack of trust
When we are litter,we even don't know what is right and what is wrong
In the other word,we can say we are childlish
But when we grow up,everything changes
In a word,i think the only way to solve this problem is empressement
But I feel very happy,because I have 
reply a letter 
Now I am thinking the reply to old lady
After the year changed, we can hear this greeting anywhere
We get new year's cards from friends and relatives at 1st jun
It is usual work in December to make these greeting cards
We write our present condition and consideration, print photo
on coloful greeting cards
I'm sorry for a long time not to contact you
All Japanese know there are a lot of people 
and we appreciate their support ongoing rescue, relief and so on

It was the last content
I wrok as a MOT(Microsoft Office Trainer
The day before yesterday, I helped to make a examination list of Pigeon Racing
The fastest pigeon can be back from 1400K far for only 2 days
I was very surprised not only the distance, but also their speed
Now I am trying to translate a letter from American old lady
But i cannot understand what she says
What does she wish her letter would be different from
She considers my letter is not good
She is a Christianity and I a Buddhist
So I wonder she intends to say Happy Xmas

Yesterday I was given a lot of adzuki bean by my neighborhood
So I tried to cook the Japanese sweet \"ZenZai\" for the first time in my life
washed beans and boiled it
I didn't know that the bean expands after boiling
As soon as my husband watch it, he shouted \" who can eat this all 
oh Wikipedia tought me Zenzai is called \"red bean soup\" 
We eat it by chopsticks 
no chinese spoon
Explain what you consider to be the normal types of pets that people could own
I think that dogs and cats are popular as pets in my country
They have been with human for long long ages
Not only because they have much been human's companion with their impression

and is the only goldfish that has the show

The babies are whole gray
About three months later, they will be colored\" my friend said
I am looking forward to bringing them up
The test place is a college where I graduated
After the test finishing, I had about an hour till my husband picked me up
So I visited a coffee shop where I sometime visited 
It is the same as a North European tableware maker
The shop keeper told me about Herend, so I told her
I sometime visited here when I was a student
We were talking our present condition each other
Thaks for a peaceful time

I'm working as aclerk in doughnut shop, but today's sales were smaller than usual (*´；ェ；｀*) 
Please come my shop
On my way home, I bought Sushi and side dish at half price in supermarket
Today, I went shopping with friend
On April 15th, a new semester begins, so I need a new bag for carrying textbooks and PC

Although there were many bags in the shops, I didn't feel their designs good
I plan to buy a bag by the internet shopping
Actually, my original name is not Don
It is Dong Chun Kim that is called in Korea as my whole name
As you feel my whole name is not as easy name to pronounce, so I have abbreviated it to Don
Wanting their offspring to live following the meaning, what the name means is the first priority when Korean fathers give name to their sons
If somebody asks me what makes me feel happy in my life, I would definitely respond that it is delicious foods that make me happy
I love not only the flavor of it, but also the atmosphere when I have it with my friends
While eating we also drink alcohol, chat and, of course, make joke
What I hate most in the Universe is the rat
No matter the size

This is the best learning way of English
Today, I had quarrel with my one of friend who i know about 2 years
I met with him on yahoo chess site, and became friend
We went to go to swimming together or beach sometimes, so at that time we are good friends
He is a foreiner and lived my country for along time, but he can not speak language so well, so usually we talk in English
But I noticed he sometimes remarks bad thing to my country, and bad things to our people
Everytimes i herad such things, it is misunderstanding, and i explaint to him , it is not true
he didnot change
The reason we quarrel each othere today is that he sometimes say sarcastic and trash talk, it is ok sometimes trash talk and say joke, but sometimes it hurts my feeling, so i asked him not to say such thing even if we are freind
But it did not work well, and our relashionship collapes
I think we can not recovery our relationship
It is really sad thing
Becase it is not easy to find foreign freind in my country
so i was happy to have a foreign freind in my country
I know diferent country have diferent coustom, thought , many thing
but i tried to look better side and keep good friendship
But i couldn't stand what he say to me and my country
Of couce i am not perfect person, there is some wrong part to me, but i couldnot accept what he said
So our relashion ship collapes
thanks reading this

I taught English to my junior high shcool studnet and I found this in the dictionary
walk' has meaning 'to make something walk
Of cource i know the meaning ' walk

Today, I went shopping to buy a key holder of　sample of food with my friend
What is “Sample of foods”
It is a fake of meals or foods like this
In Japan,　in front of restaurant’s entrance, there is often Sample of foods
It is very similar to real meals
I have heard that tourists from foreign countries are surprised to see them
And, this price is not cheap, a small key holder ’s price is over 700 yen(about 7 U
It is because, they are handmade
A professional Sample of foods maker makes every of them by their hands
We went to buy it for our native speaker teacher of Urudu
He is leaving from Japan in this winter
So we wanted to give him a thing characteristic of Japan
I start to  produce myself
Mio loves tomatomato
Mio don't like janglejim
I had to translate a poem, 'Lines Left upon a Seat in a Yew Tree' by Wordsworth into Japanese
I always struggle with the translation especially when it comes to the poetry
English is a very useful language when you try to express your feeling because one word has a lot of meanings, but when you try to analyse a poetry or something, it's so hard to find out what a word really means, I think
I would like not to mention about my study anymore now
I love both beer and wine, but recently beer doesn't suit me
maybe it's because I'm not a young enough to drink a lot of beer anymore
It was a wine from Barcerola because I remembered one of my friends from Catalonia reccomended it to me one day
I'm not sure if there is a person who is reading this
If you read this, I'm sorry my diary is not an intersting one, but I would like to reccomend you the bottle of wine about which I mentioned above

Trip to Hongkong
In fact my wife comes from Hong Kong
We are visiting her hometown in years
In the beginning, I can enjoy western styles of foods like bread, cheese, and pizza, but after sometime, I started to miss Korean foods so much
However, Korean foods were quite expensive and it is hard to find Korean restaurants
I think a lot of foreign people are facing similar difficulties in Korea if they come from some small countries
They have something like congee, a lot of noodles, and many sea oriented foods
I still remember a course of 12 dishes we had at the banquet in Hong Kong
I started to study English in my first year of the middle school
It was a lot late compared with students these days
As I know, they start to learn English much earlier age even from the pre-school or kindergarten
That may be the reason my conversation skill is not as good as my reading and writing skills
I think any language should be acquired in one's early age at least before 10 years old; otherwise, it would be a difficult task for him to speak the language fluently as native speakers do
Hopefully, I can improve my English writing skill and help other people's Korean writing
The ritual came from the Confucianism
We have grown up reading some Chinese novels like \"Sam-Kuk-Ji\", and \"Seo-U-Ki.\" Even some old people were very proud of saying they read the book series for several times
Some people have thought Chinese have a bigger body than Korean because we are in different ethnic groups
Around 10 years ago, I could have the first chance to meet Chinese, first, people from Taiwan and then main land China
They spoke a language I could never understand, which made me so wonder how people from two nations were able to communicate for several thousand years and how so many cultures could be transferred between two countries
Frankly, I got impression that they were poor and little tiny but I started to enjoy their food especially ones from \"Schezan\" area
Hello everyone
Sometimes it needs to speak English
And nowadays we have many guests from overseas　especially China & Korea
So I started to learn Korean, but it is difficult for me
I will try to write diary in Korean someday

HI every one  i want to spaker english， i hope your can help me
Today is holiday and I don't go to school
I feel so happy ^ ^ but now feel so bored
Intro
Hi
I'm new here
Trying to practice my English writing skills
I guess I have to come up with a subject I need to write about and 
hopefully it is an interesting one
What I'm having a problem with English is when to use \"the\" properly
As I write more in English, hope to learn right way to use \"the\" in the sentence
Foe  example  ,I watched  the  Website ,and   ordered  something
if  assume  here  that  it  was  a  bear  doll)  
So  I  wanted  to  call  there
If  I  said  \"Hello  my name  is,,,,   
I  am  a  Japanese
is  
or  ○×△□？
Hahaha
So  I  made  my  own English  expression , \"Hello  
When  I  ask  someone about  this  , all  answer  show  this  way
Natives  seldom  do  speak  \"As  for  ~\"  in  like  this   case
No  expression  ,which  I  can  find  in(?)  like  this  case
Please  help  me  ,if  possible briefly
What  sould  be  treated  by  us  
Excuse  me  for  my  broken  English  
Regards  about  this  probrem  and  about  correcting  my  sentences
　The  earthquake  forcast　,2011,3,14
Please  laugh  at  me  with  saying fool
I  made  a  conclusion  about  the  relation  between  the  earthquqke  and  planet location
The  last  year I  wrote  (I  may have  delate  it.) the  figures  about  grobal  potential  energy  
I  reserched  the  relation but  I  could'nt find
the  exact  frequency  about between  figures  and earthquake
Beacause  the  exception  ,most  biggest  Smatora  Ireland M9.3  , was  itself but  I  can't  find relation
The  last  year  I  wondered  that  as  for the  \"Big\" earthquake  happen  at  
after  highest or lowest  of  this  figure 
But I  can  not  exactly  trust  this  even till  now 
But the  Big earthquake  in 2010 ,and  like Kobe ,and  so  on  ,happenedly  occared  at  within one  month  before  or  later 
I have already  reserched  it  
As  sentences  may  become  so  long  ,the  following  is  my conclusion 
①　When universal  grobal potential  energy  was  around  highest  or  lowest ,the　earthquake energy  may has  thendency  that it becomes  big
②　As  for the  seabed  fault(=slit) ,which  is  compensately  vertical against  mass  cerculation(?) ,moves (Aassume
③Date  has  some  tendency  ,but  it  is  difficult to find.(becomes  too  many  daies \/per  around  it
※② is  suspecious 
※About  ①　,a  few  exception  can  not be  found  by  this  method
Please  be your  refference(s
I  thank  for  your  reading
500～600km  far  away  ,urban  location  here  in  Tokyo ,that  was  not  the  earthquake , the  warms (catapillers?) ,which  were too  many  and  which were 1m creeped  under  the  ground  south  to  north
While  30  minutes,  while  1  hour
I  regret　now
Thease  are  glasses
What'  this  -o-o- 
Thease  are  glasses 
Somebody  please  tell  me  about  ths  sperit  :these  are  
※I  have remembered  that  I  was  taught  on first  year  at  junior  
exactly  may  have  been  what  called  plural  nown 
Please  tell me  for  fixing  this  global  communication  gap  anyhow
   Today  ,it  rained
The  rain  has  been  dropped  without  stopping  
It  is  as  though  like  someone  were  fallen  the  backet  upside  down  ,in  the  sky 
The bicycle  shed  ,which  was  hit  its  roof   by  rain  ,and  it  was
so  like  musical  instrument  tympani  
  Please  tell  me  about  the  words  of  the  song  of  Doremi
I  hear  it  every  morining 
Mr
Adam 
Thank you verry much 
To make sure ,I hereby write Japanese words of the song of Doremi
ど、はドーナツのど　　(Do　of Donuits
れはレモンのれ (Re of Lemon 
みはみんなのみ (Mi of みんな＝all friends
ふぁはファイトのふぁ (Fa of Fight　
そは　そらたかく～(空高く～） (So is そらたかく＝highly in the sky
らはラッパのら～ (La of らっぱ＝trumpet
し～は幸せよ～（しあわせよ～） (Si is しあわせ＝happiness）
さあう～たい～ま～しょう(さあ歌いましょう）　　（Now let's sing 　）
どれみふぁそらしど、そ、ど！
（ドレミファソラシド、ソド　）
Please try to sing in Japanese if you remember what stated above 
I  shall add  one  more  question 
Why  do  not  they  express  like  \"Do  is  doe  ,a  famale  deer.\" as  the  sentence  in  English 
Even  I  feel   the  words  of  the  fact  for  the  words 
Are  thease  the  clauses  of  the  sentence 
Or  shorten  expression  ,as  which  I  should  think 
　　Hello
Today  is 7,August,2010

I have  been  in  poor  health 
I  wish  that  you  can  spend  wonderful
（私は）体調が悪い（たうちょうがわるい=poor  health）。
These seven hiragana are the first syllables of these important foods for health
Wakame is a kind of seaweeds and used as ingredients in miso soup
In a word, edible seaweeds is good for health
By the way, chawanmushi is the one of the most famous steamed egg dishes in Japan
And, \"まごはやさしい\" also means a Japanese passage
I'd like to take care of my health and stick it out so I can see my grandchildren smile
hello every body
Good Morning I form thailand my name is jirawut I come to here this first time for patice read wright english language for improve and devellop I hope any one help to me in the next time i will try to write beatiful place in thailand 
So all classes were canceled
I wanna go to school tomorrow
I hope sunny
Waiting him is what she hates the most
She looks again the old clock
The silence is surrounding her and she can help trembling while thinks about him
The living-room is cold, so is she
Her voice is a whisper that disappears into the living-room like a dream does when the night is over
She can stand it anymore and turn on the tv and her eyes got fixed on the screen
Breathless, she finally arrives there to find him putting his shoes off and she’s unable to control herself and holds him so tight that he can breathe
Smiling, the boy kisses her head and pulls her away softy “It’s late, you should be sleeping, no waiting for me” he says tenderly “You know I won’t be sleeping until you’ll be here” Narrowing his eyes, the boy walks through the corridor until he realizes the TV is still on
In silence, he crosses the door and his eyes glues on the screen
There, he holds her tight making her smile
“Now you’re here I can sleep”
i'm alive
i'm alive
bonjour tous
Im not dead
haha
Im hardly active on here, but i always check my inbox, messages, and watch all the new submissions
I don't like this place, it is so different from the blogs that i used before and it can't be open under other browsers except IE
All i feel here is sadness and nostalgia
However, im sure i'll upload stuff, and try to comment
All i do is stalk and +fav these days
I am an extremely positive soul now, alot has changed, alot has happened, alot has made me realise where id been going wrong for a very long time
i feel my life is alot more forfilling and just generally better
I love growing and learning, there is no better feeling then being able to look at yourself, at how you were, and how you are now, and the positive changes you are able to impliment upon yourself through time and experience
No matter how society changes, there are things which haven't changed through times; sense of following rules, morality, public mind, consideration towards others,a mind of human rights, the awe to things which have powers beyond human and love for our hometown's nature and culture
Education is being needed to foster these social characters and rich human minds according to children development stages
Long time has passed since I wrote a last diary before
As I wanna be a teacher, I definitely need to improve my English skills, especially writing n speaking skills
Is it possible that I can improve with just writing n writing, like this way
If you took bother to correct my English on this website, how would I learn from it
Just watch and say thanks
Or should I remember all mistakes
But I'm kind of depressed and am upset, not knowing what to do
If u might have any opinions, don't hesitate to tell me, please
Music preference are various depends on people
Each person has an each preference of music) 
Well, I'm not a good speaker in both English and Japanese
At the moment, I forget what a real conversation is like
It's gunna be a long story
Anyway, i can't enjoy conversations whoever I talk to
My mind wander
How would u overcome
We went to one of my favourite restaurants in Sannomiya where we ate Gyoza, Chinese dumpling
I'll tell you about this
During my class, my students had their presentations
I'll explain about this class
Well this class is International class
So some of them are very skillfull of their English and they are even better than I am
This class has 4 teachers including me
So my role is a kind of easy
I usually help them use computers
So I don't usually use English this class, which was a kind of relieving to me
After they finished thier presentation, other teachers started giving comments and feedback about their presentation
I didn't expect that I would gave comments in front of them
So when the other teacher asked me to make comments suddenly, I got so nervous 
Ah,,I very enjoyed it
I regret that I couldn't speak such an easy English and give longer, more decent and appropriate comments
i noticed that a few of them laughed at me
I want to be fluent more
Things I am concerned
I am worried about a lot of things
So I have to concentrate on my work but I am always sleepy, so i can't
I think some of you might say like this
Are you sleepy
However, for me, it is something
I really sleepy all the time during classes
i know I should concentrate on what I am doing but I can't
I even cannot speak Japanese very well when I am sleepy, though I am a Japanese
Yes I am, which is so annoying to me
This situation has happened since I got a mental sickness, which is 4 years ago
Though the sickness seemed to have disappeared already, I am still sleepy and easily get tired
So sometimes when I teach them I really get confused with what to do or what should be done in a process
That's a problem
i don't wanna look like a wierdo
I am wondering the quality of my sleep is not good enough to wake up daytime
I really want to have a sound sleep
①Although it's gradual, various trials which seek out a form of education have begun in schools of each area
If the ideas or devices of teachers and lecturers accord with the expectations from children and parents, these trials must have good effects
At first, I suggest it is important to let children study what to learn, how to think and how to express
Looking back on this 30 years, I cannot but be surprised at intensive changes of the suburbs of Tokyo
You cannot see the reminiscence of old fields unless you go far from the central of the city
For our country, it's extremely important to increase mutual understandings between nations through international exchange and advertising activities in each field and is also important to build friendly relationships based on mutual trust
i could not did my best as I was so nervous and it was partly because I realized that I was not so serious
The reason why I said i wasn't serious about taking tests is that I didn't have a specific goal for my future
It's kinda like, I felt I had been forced to do anything
It's been a big problem to me for a long time
today when I was studying English, I realized that I wasn't eligible to become a teacher because I didn't know of good conversations
I think I'm not qualified to become a teacher unless I enjoy conversations
If you don't have communication skill, you shouldn't teach
As I realized above conclusion this afternoon, I went to a church where I hung out a lot
There I decided to talk what I have in mind more positively
Next time, I'm going to talk to a person who has been attractive for me
There are something troublesome for foreigners who are going to live in Japan , one of which is a trouble because of not being good at Japanese
It is difficult for them to deal with things like garbage collecting which rules are detailed respectively each area, getting along with neighbors
Today in kobe city, we have an annual big event, Fire works Festival
So I am going to wear a yukata, which is a traditional Japanese clothes for summer
It is need to create person who can say his or her opinion, which is not borrowed from others, toward outside in English, (りっぱに？？） ,person who can explain the situation which is peculiar to Japan and convince someone
Even if a teacher have a higher skill of teaching, it might often not do well if there is no connection between a teacher and students' mind
In order that teacher's skillful questions and feedback are to be welcomed by children, mutual trust must be needed as a first step
What makes me worry about English study is that, recently the number of people who emphasize 'usefulness' on English study has been increasing and a fundamental problem of what language study means to human has been left
Family plays a very important role in the sound growth of juveniles
Parents centered family, members of which help each other, helps to foster a considerate mind towards family in child's heart
According to my experience, the possibility is very low that something you had saved before as you thought it would be useful afterward is actually useful
The reason why we make something tidy is because we reuse it afterward
You would feel refreshing if you dispose something which you decided to throw away
Regarding the title; I wanted to write 'about me of these days
Firstly I have taken some interviews and passed them
So, I'm gonna be a teacher at a high school from next year
I will try hard but I am not trying too hard so that I won't be depressed
Secondly, I visited a live show which took place in Sannnomiya city
Tha band I watched was called Kirinji, which is not so famous even among Japanese
They are consist of Horigome brothers
i have been loving them for almost 4 years
Their music is a kind of complicated
Jazz, pops, rock, fusion, techno
everything in it
Because of their high sophisticated style of music, lots of professional musicians praise them
But it's so complicated and they wouldn't show up so often on TV or any given media, 
they are not so famous
Anyway I am very fond of them
Although I usually don't like going to watch a show of any artists as I can't bear standing all the time as much as 2 hours, 
the show of Kirinji was wonderful
How can they create such an exquisite music
How would you develope listening skill of your students
It's been a long time since I wrote my diary last
The exam, which is for becoming a teacher, has been finished
It's because of interviewee's severe questions
Although it's getting cooler, the heat makes me dull all day
There are unexpectedly many people who believe that they can control
However, once they got sick, they would realize that they are dominated by the rule which they cannot control even their bodies
The ability to be loved by people is perhaps one of the most valuable ability you could equip
If it were not for the ability, your talent, no matter how wonderful it is, might be lost on large scale
You were supposed to put unburned garbage into the specific bin, weren't you
As I wrote in my last diary, students are so nice
Some are so cute that I would like go out with them if it is not illegal
I am so nervous that I can't speak Englsih well, even I can't speak Japanese well
Though I am getting used to stand and teach in front of them, still it's embarrasing and I feel nervous
I really want to get to know and make good relationship with them
However, I feek so isolated that neither I can open my heart nor relax myself
I know I should interact with ALTs and improve my English, but I'm so tired to the extent that I am not able to communicate smoothly
So I have decided to wake up more earlier and take some exercise
It is said that taking some exercise in the morning make us heathier
①In terms of history, the Democracy has been made(founded?) very recently
At the stage of the age,  among the first words what children utter, there come words such as 'my' and 'mine'  
Considering both, I prefer the latter one
We spent almost all dat practicing because it has been a long time to meet together
We are supposed to play our song in the ceremony, which wil be fun for us and guests
After the practice,we went to a Karaoke
I'm not good at singing so but I wanna be good
It would be great if anyone who see this diary correct my mistakes
I don't know whether i want to be a teacher or not in a true sense
What's worse I am getting old
It's a bit old age to change a job
And of course, under the current recession in Japan
Right now I am working as a tutor at a high school prep and so on
But the job is just only temporary one, so it's unstable, you know
I need to get a proper job enough to make a living
So once in a while I get miserably depressed
Likewise, since yesterday until this noon, I had been down
But I have realized that life is going on as it is no matter how you get depressed or how you are worried about your future
No matter how you worry, sometimes you can achieve what you want and sometimes you cannot
Still, Life will goes on
So all I have to do now is to do what I can do now
That's the essential key to the problem facing me
It's not so positive but still challenging one , isn't it
Do you have any deseases
According to the announcement of Ministry of Labor and Health, about 30 percent out of 120 million Japanese have some symptoms such as high pressure, backache(腰痛？), sore shoulder, disorder of eyes and so on because of aging, stress and overworking
Long time no see
It's been a long time to enter my diary
I think I always put the same phrase as above every time when I start this
Well, I will talk about my recent things
I've just begun teaching at high school
I am having fun at school
Students are so nice and obedient, which is very good to me because I am a beginner
But there aren's always good things
Firstly, students are very very good at English because this school is well known for its high sophisticated English education
So it's hard for me to teach them as some of them are even better than me
There are some students who grew up overseas
In terms of speaking, I am inferior to them
Today,the cold deteriorates because I helped the senior till late time yesterday
I helped to edit the video what celebrates the senior's friends getting marry
So my condition is broken at noon when I went to work
I were sleeping till I want back home this afternoon
Now that I eat some light diner ,and I will go to bed to be quiet
Trying too hard is too bad
Now JAPAN fall into serious crisis 
I am no problem because I live in Nara
But my grandfather live in Fukushima
Fukushima is very near the center of the earthquake
I only keep researching the information of this area
failures into seeds of success and bring happiness to your life
hardships of life leave you depressed, you can feel much better by 
Then, your discouraging experience can be an essential step toward the 
So, I am always trying to keep staying positive 
Now I am an optimistic person, but I used to be easily depressed by failures
However, I changed the way of thinking after listening to a speech, which is given by Steve Jobs, who is a founder and a CEO of Apple Computer
It is really impressive and gives me courage to keep 
making efforts even if I face plights
and hardships but he taught me how to handle difficulties
He established Apple Computer when he was young, and enjoyed 
But suddenly, 
Jobs became extremely distressed and lost the will to do anything
He determined to start again and 
struggled to survive, because he liked his job very much
Then, he 
launched a new company named Next and another company named 
Pixar after such a discouraging event
The company he sold has become the foundation and been playing an important role in Apple
He addressed that if he had not been fired, Apple would not have become one of the most successful companies in the world
His story demonstrates that difficulties at the time can be an 
essential link to greater happiness
Positive thinking paves the way 
for making success
Looking back in the past he realized that his 
failures were not so bad and that they are necessary step toward his 
future success
There is no need not to be depressed, because the 
sun always rises again, after all
So, don't you think that it is ridiculous to get discouraged every time a difficulty may occur
Second, do not speak depressing words
If you keep showing optimistic, your optimism grows

The website defines \"paternalism\" as the following sentences
Moreover, according to “Guide to Cross Cultural Communication” which is written by Sana Reynolds and Deborah Valentine, there are two characteristics in “paternalism”
First, people who have more powerful control less powerful people
Second, people who have the right to control less powerful people must take of them
I have defined “paternalism” up to now
Henceforth, I would like to write about a social issue in Japanese society in which I think “paternalism” is observed
I think “paternalism” is still observed in medicine
This is because the doctor has confidence in my ability
Certainly, the doctor’s decision is sometimes right, but there are a few chances to misunderstand the condition of the patient

I'll take a break for this summer and came back in September
So I said to him \"Good

Here I meant \"その調子で頑張って\" by saying \"Keep it going!\" but is it actually wrong expression
I love scandinavian funitures
In these days I am into scandinavian funitures
I love its sofisticated, cute, not get old quickly and simple design, and I feel the warmth of wood from them
Many antique scandinavian funtures are made by rosewood or mahogany or teak wood, so they have different aura toward contemporary wooden funitures
The color of the woods are intermediate between oak and walnat which are popular woods in contemporary funitures
And recently rosewood and teak are hard to find, so there are many funs for antique funitures
In some days, I would like to own Wegner’s bear chair, Finn Juhl’s poet sofa, etc
Since there are very expesive, I have to save money to get them

cuttting tomato, egg apple, mozzarella　cheese, salami
I only watched it
We put a lot of topping on the pizza and burned it
After 30 minutes, we were surprised because the pizza was burned black, especially salami
The taste was not good enough
But we enjoyed making a pizza
We will succeed it next time

Wooden musical instruments often crack because of quick change of temperature
This bamboo flute would be my grandfather's father's -and I succeeded to it as a remembracnce
Today I go to a repaire shop to ask if this bamboo flute can be repaired
Yesterday found me discussing bamboo flute's history and custom with a craftsman,teacher of bamboo flute, until the twilight

Bamboo flute is not so dificcult as you have thought
It's fascinating about 600 people in California ,according to mypupil teaching in California
I'm involved in the Revival of Orthodox Bamboo Flute in China
and so on till we noticed the twilight was coming．It was pretty constructing！
A english wordbook in japan
this book introduce slang words and lines that used in a movie \"full metal jacket
Any other
I think these books for Otaku are not suited for leaning languages
just funny
by the way
Are there such books like that in other country
and Do you want to read such wordbooks for leaning other languages
Today is a beautiful sunny day and Saturday
I usually spend  weekends to go shopping or do excacise or just relax
I always think that to keep a diary in English is a good way to plactice my English skills
But, unfortunatly, I quit in a way to do it
Therefore, I chose to join in this Lang-8
But my English was not improve, one thing that I felt is I am not afraid of  English any more even thought I could not what people said
In other words, I do not care about the surrouding people
I don't know it is good or bad
I have still been eager that I wish I could use English like as native
Second, I am going to go shopping
I hope I have a good weekend, and also all of you have that too 
在我住在的地方梅雨期完了！
本格的夏期要开始了。
为地震的影响，在日本有运动，大家节约使用的电气。
所以，在事务室里比以前轻服也可以。
但是，窗Ｔ恤不可以的，我想窗T恤做工作啊。
来中国里的话，一般大家已经做coolbiz了呀！
我看，也工作时很多人穿了很凉快的衣服啊。
As foreign people also may be so, there are a lot of situationd to use the Microsoft Power Point on presentations
The revolutionary software has been very useful to hand on information effectively and provocatively to audience
I also often use the application conveniently, although, I have a big problem with using the software when translating Japanese material into English one
I often translate Power Point documents in Japanese into English
Mistakes in a translation aren't of problems because  it's checked by a senior of mine at the end of the translation
Kanji shows many meaning by a word
Speaking to a example which I encountered today, I dealt with \"法令対応範囲.\" (6 words) It means \"scope for the enforcement by Japanese law.\" But if I try to enter the phrase in small box on a sheet of a Power Point document, the phrase can be entered with only small fonts which wouldn't be seen by remote audience when having a presentation
So how to fit a small space bothers me every time to translate Japanese into English
But my boss won't do so
I've been very busy and tired for this one week because I have several tasks that are supposed to be submitted to my boss in several days in order to promote our project
I'm very sad to be expecting to see only my daughter's good sleeping face today too
As you may know, the Japanese calender has the \"Golden week\" which is combination of national holidays in early May
But I don't like this system on which the government place many national holidays and make up consecutive holidays
Since everybody have to get off at the same time, almost all of places where people will go, such as any amusement parks, zoos, theaters, the roads people will get there and so on, would be hardly crowded
Although Japanese labor system has the same system of the \"holiday of pay\"　applied to many foreign countries which everybody can take it at will, willingly Japanese workers won't get it supposedly because Japanese has  assiduity　basically and doesn't go for acting alone such as getting a holiday with pay while co-workers works
I think this is so inefficient that We should decrease national holidays and make getting a certain number of holidays with pay obligatory
It's the center of the Golden week right now, but unlike such situation, I'm working at office as usual
This is the first diary in this site
I can't understand lang-8 system well
I've been to London UK last year for 2 month to learn English
I have only few opportunity to communicate with foreign people in English, so I think I must find or make opportunity to communicate with anyone who can use English
Oh, it's so late, I've just felt strong sleepy
Are lots of patients having allergy to pollen in your country
I've often heard allergy to pollen, especially of Japanese ceder, has become a national disease of Japanese people nowadays
On this season, by the beginning of spring, pollens of Japanese ceder is starting to fly to almost everywhere in Japan
Major symptoms are a runny nose, sneezing and itchy eyes
They are very rough symptoms
I've also haven allergy to pollen since 10 years ago
Firstly I thought I had caught cold at that day, but after weeks from the finding I realized I had been a allergy to pollen because there aren't such protracted colds
Recently I use antiallergic drugs such as a histamine-antagonizing agent and drops and a nasal drip of steroids
the symptoms can be almost controlled by them
According to a weather forecast of today, it is fine day tomorrow
Usually I can think the fine day is very good and comfortable, but only in this season I might be able to think so
Because pollens are fling anywhere and sometimes the symptoms are appearing by enormous pollens in air
I have very hard work within the last month and this situation would continue in a month
As you might know, generality of companies originated in Japan close their financial period at the end of May, which is applied in my company too
So just these day are the center of busy term for finance-related personnel -I'm also the one of the people- in a lot of Japanese companies
But for this season we can see beautiful full-blown cherry blossoms throughout along my way to my company
A mind for cherry blossoms in Japanese
I think there must be nobody of Japanese who dislike cherry blossoms
As you can find in pictures above, in this season we have a field party under cherry trees seeing the blossoms opening up on the trees or flying off
We call the party as \"花見 hanami.\" 
One week ago, I also went to a park with my wife and daughter to where it took 30 minutes by car from my home
I was very happy to see just starting the blossoms' to fall off from the branches, as if cherry blossoms are April showers
Especially Japanese people are fascinated by falling cherry blossoms
Medieval Japanese fighter 'Bushi' would have hoped to die with dignity and beauty like falling cherry blossoms during battles
As a matter of course, we haven't thought so, but I think the consideration for the 'cherry blossom' is one of precious inheriting and to inherit cultures in Japanese
Do you know the captioned phrase
As it may be known in only Japan, it's a national campaign against increasing of CO2 emission
If you want to know more information, please read the following site
thorough recycle of wastes generated on our business operation
Although I think I'm proud of our company's actions and also individually try to do them for voluntary, recently our office is so hot that I can't get out my paper fan, which is called \"団扇\" in Japanese and harness only my own power, due to a energy cut for artificial coolings
Sometimes the hotness make me thinking that we reduce of our working efficiency by 6% while we reduce of CO2 emission by 6
I'm writing a notification which informs managers of our subsidiary companies of a schedule for submission of some documents to our office
Firstly I wrote Japanese version and now I'm trying to translate it to English
But I think it's difficult due to an ambiguity of Japanese
As you may know, English word order is very strict and subjects in English play very important rolls, which are not usually omitted, I think
I was often said by my co-worker who is good at writting English that foreign people wouldn't be able to understand my text when I asked him of scanning through it  after translating Japanese to English
Sometimes children get amazingly different meaning from phrases which are spoken by adult people or TV programs
My daughter watch a TV program which is a animation program about vegetable dolls on the morning of every week days
One day pretending the narrator I said \"Have a good night!\" on watching the program
After that, my daughter abruptly said \"おかたづけ!\" As you may know, the word as Japanese means clearing off goods or toys
I didn't know why she spoke so suddenly
But a few days later I had understood the reason
She understood the meaning of \"Have a good night\" as \"Have a nainai (ないない
ないない\" is one of baby words, means cleaning off goods or toys
She could hear wrongly \"good night\" to \"nainai.\" Nowadays every just before cleaning off she said the phrase
Wife's friends, who are all women,  came to my home from Nagoya to see my wife and daughter today
My wife and them are nurses and worked in a same hospital up until 3 years ago, when we moved to Osaka from Nagoya due to my company transfer
They were surprised at my daughter's growing because I think they would have met my daughter for the first time in 2 years
My wife and I cooked some Japanese dishes, flied oyster, flied shrimp, boiled chicken with soy source, pork soup with various root vegetable and salad
They talked about some themes, such as a medical policy of the Japanese government, environments of hospitals where they were working currently and their own loves
As you may think so, the voices just came to me because I wasn't beside them, briefly, I stayed in another room in order to do my work
One of my hobbies is taking photos - especially, of my daughter
I like to take photos because a photo can have the time and the landscape nailed into a picture as if a flash freezing of the field of view through a camera's finder
Sometimes I could catch a special scene onto a photo, such as really pretty behaviors or flash mild aspect of my daughter
I've tried taking photos to keep the special scenes into still pictures because I'll show them to my daughter future
But nowadays I have only a problem with taking photos
I taking photos in RAW format
As the term \"RAW\" says, it's raw data of a camera's photosensitive element without compressing of its size
Thus each file size of photos is very large, about 15MB a photo
I didn't go to the Universal Studio Japan where I wrote that I had been going there with my pretty daughter 2 days ago
Finally I went to shopping with her and my wife
Tomorrow is the national holiday which is called National Foundation Day of Japan
I'm also day-off tomorrow
I have the Free Pass for one-year and she is free to enter it because she is young
Today I watched a film titled 'Nodame cantabile' with my family
I can highly recommend this,as we bursted into laughing
She acts really differntly in each films
Because that I thought the characters happpily make their lives with jobs which they are into
To be honnest,I want to go for a master degree in psycology,about which I dreamt at high school
But I decided to do a course in English with some reason at uni,and I've been making a progress
In my opinion,it's natural for us to make mistakes in making choices,and it's never late to let us go to the right way
But it's seemed they don't really like this idea because they believe I should make use of my English skill to make a live as long as I've studied abroad
But I also believe my experience in England is valuable not only for my job,but also my life
I know that I should go my way,but I just don't want to make them disappointed od sad by my choice
Ｉwent to a meeting of an alumni the day before yesterday
I'd been excited and actually a bit anxious,because I hadn't seen them for quite long time
But I needn't've felt so
We had a lot of fun,talking ,eating,drinking
To my supprised,four folks already have babys
There was one of the baby
ahhh someday,I also wanna bring up such an angelic baby..♥

We rarely go out at night so we are excited very well today
I will go back my parent's home
It is the costom that we go back our parent's home new year in Japan
My wife went to part time job
But I had a mistake
That's a secret for her
But I have not said that I have loved her after our wedding day
He was lucky he had a good luck
I live in Incheon far from the university

After that, I want to visit South America's countries where I've never been yet
Even though I havn't watch this match, I am pround of the whole United team
I think it is a excellent web site for who want to learn a foreign language
I used to have a blog but I am not typing it frequently
However, I will keep typing this blog since I'm loving it
Hopefully my english can be improve in the future
At the same time, babies are gifted innate humor which enables them to laugh a lot in the future
It is natural that there are crest and tough in our live
Therefore, as human beings, we may weigh down by the stress if we couldn't find a suitable way to relieve them
Some of them shout loudly or scream, some of them take a vacation, and most of the women go shopping and maximize their credit cards
There are various activities that could relive stress, but we should only consider the ways that are harmless to ourselves and the others
On the other hand, if we make good use of our sense of humor, we are not only can reduce pressure but also bring plenty of happiness to ourselves and people around us
I got a serious homesick this week and I hate this feelings
I am a patient listener but now I want to find one to share my feelings
I miss my sisters and brother
We used to fight, arguing and stole each other's chocolate and candies
I enjoy that kind of life with them
They makes me laugh all time
It is very sad to stay alone in the room without my sisters and brother
Hopefully I will survive in the next few months and I can play with them again when I go back to home
I can't get rid of them
I have been Canada for five months
I miss my family, my friends, my six dogs and the delicious food in my home town
Studying in Canada is a valuale chance for me to become mature and learn to overcome tons of difficulties and barries
This is my first time to see snow and I'm overjoyed
Canadian are friendly and nice
They always put on smiles on their faces
Last time when my friend and me was leaving the Superstore and decided to walk back to the drom, a Canadian couple drive us back
We are extremely appreciate what they did since we were cold and not used to the weather
today bad weather
i wentn to around city for shoping on boxing day
i've bought bag some cosmetics some clothes etc
All the birthday gifts I have received were few and normal
Maybe, to other people, there were no any special features in those presents
However, I thought whether a present is special or not depends on your own mind rather than other people’s opinion
Contrast to other gifts, it was the most simple and cheapest one, but it was also my favorite one
Different from those pencil boxes we can see in the bookstore, it was not made of textile but plastic
Compared with those colorful and delicate designed stationary is its simple white-black color matching and square shape
My friends usually praise my box for its cute pattern different from those monotonous logos on other pencil boxes
What a delight for me is that everybody likes the pencil box so mush and wants to buy a same one for themselves
Nevertheless, the reason why I like the present so much is not the pattern, the color or the shape, but the benediction contained in the gift
What touched me deeply was that my classmate carved some notes with best wishes in the pencil box for me
Come on,come on
Athough,english is very difficult for me
But, I must success if i try my best
Keep~!!!keep
Where there is will,there is a way
From now on,I decide to remeber some English vocabulary everyday

The Russo-Japanese War started because Japan wanted to halt the spread of the Russian expansion into East Asia
This was what Japan feared the most, because they regarded Korea and Manchuria as a buffer
If an agreement was not made soon, there was going to be a war, and this worried all of Europe because Russia was allied with France and Germany, and Japan had signed a treaty with Great Britain
Europe was worried that the war would spread around the world
It’s not that anyone sought war in both countries, but no matter what happened it’s as if the war was supposed to happen
Though these circumstances only came to be due to the old governments’ policies dating back almost half a century
The following will explain in detail the events of the Russo-Japanese war and how Japan was conceived as an “easy” enemy, but came to be acknowledged as one of the greatest military powers in the world after the apparent victory during the Battle of the Sea of Japan
My boyfriend had been a hot temper person, but he improvemented himself for staying by my side

I found his change, so I realized that my talking attitude had was too impatient
Whether I'm wrong?\" I asked
No, I think you are anger when we talked about the wretched farmers, due to you are kindhearted
I feel he is gentle unlike before, and I am be deeply touched by him
Love him so much

My interest grew stronger as your company has started launching Russian servers and hiring Russian-speaking employees
They started hiring together with preparations to launch, not if they've launched them first and then started hiring) 
During my career I have had several diverse jobs, all of them required to work in a team and to deal directly with public.(Doesn't it sound stupid or too, I don't know,  cumbersome?)I found my short-time but intensive work at Autotrade AG particularly valuable in teaching me the importance of ascertaining a variety of customers' needs and providing clear and accurate information in response to those needs
Being a part of Staff Empire recruitment agency has taught me the ability to work in a constant tensioned mode (is this \"mode\" ok
it was crazy time, always under pressure) and still being always available and helpful to (to
for?) both customers and candidates
Although I don’t have any MMORPG working experience, some of my jobs required me to deal with Internet communities using appropriate tools including forums, blogs and some others
Also, as a hobby I managed (as a moderator, how to say this
Moderated
Not sure) some game community forums
isn't this too rude
Please hire me\") I would be available for abroad travels from the beginning of June (here I mean that my international passport will be ready by that time only, but maybe it's not necessary?), and I am available for interview at any time
Yours faithfully
my very first post here
Have no idea what language should I use for Journal, my French is very poor yet, so everything I can say is something like \"je m'apelle\" or \"j'habite\" etc
I really need a good motivation to use French only
So, dear friends, please consider it \"English entry
Of course, if you can call \"nice\" this year's abnormal spring
My favorite weather site promises real summer this week, we'll see, we'll see
Tomorrow I hope to succeed with one business I really need to finish
Finally I have all papers and documents for my \"abroad-passport
I really don't know how to call it in English since there's no such term in rest of the world
And here in Russia we're still like in USSR: one passport for this country, another one for travelling abroad
Really stupid
Although I don't know if I can use it soon, I don't have spare money for any kind of far-distance trips and the situation with vacation is still unclear
Whatever, at least I will have a possibility to travel
To know I can go anywhere if I really need
That somehow makes me feel better
Couple of years ago I was very \"international\" girl, I had  penpals from many countries, it was funny and interesting
After that I created account in LiveJournal and became part of Russian community there
And I've lost everybody I was in touch with from my \"international\" part
Really miss
Even more, I started using Internet in 1999 and I started it from international part
And the truth is Internet was the main thing that made me SPEAK English, me, who was learning in from early school years but couldn't say a wold
The main mistake of our school here in teaching languages is that any foreign language is taught as a subject
As a subject that has nothing in common with you
it's pretty simple - any language is an instrument of communication
So I believe that this Lang-8 space will bring back \"International\" part back to me
Of course, i can post more or less personal blahblah things here, but I'd love to be more useful for the rest of community
For example, for those ones who's studying Russian or just interested in Russian reality
I can do small tasks, for example, to write small articles about any subject you'd love to know from Russian part, or maybe I can take pictures of special places\/things etc
Any ideas\/whishes

tTo tell the truth, I don’t what I dream to
When I was in senior high school, the only thing I want to achieve is to study in the National Taiwan University
Is it very shortsighted right
tBut I really enjoy the time that I play the piano and learn English
If this topic conclude my plan in these years, going aboard for study is what I want to do
And promote my skill at playing the piano so that passing the examination
Maybe I will understand something on the way
tI join a lot of activities, search many information from everywhere, read different books including periodical, magazine to find my life’s direction
S Since this is not the competition in the exam, I don’t want to write the fake dream like I did before

How to improve my English composition writing 
Now, I'm preparing for my one year study in America as a international student
I try my best to sharpen all my ability to make progress on my English learning
However, I ecountered a difficulty on my English writing
My teachers said my compostions have weak organization
They said my ideas and thoughts of my compositions are very confused and messy
To be honest, it really was a big impact to me
I have never known there was so many problems about my writing skill
What's more, my writing grade of TOEFL also showed my writing ability is weak
I can't use concrete and clear words to support my ideas and words usage isn't idiomatic
Due to above these reasons, I decieded to try to improve my English writing by writing diaries every day
Also, I would try to write two or three compostions and ask my teachers revise them every week
I'm starting to practice this plan
I hope it could be useful and helpful for me to improve my English writing skill

Maybe its late to talk about this year's Valentine's Day, because the day was already passed
But there were something interesting that I want to record
That day I give a call to my parents to say happy Valentine's Day
My mom said she did not receive any gifts from my dad
My Daddy is one of the traditional Chinese men
He love my mom very much, but he never, or say rarely say \"I love you\" to my mom, at least never say it when I was there with them
He prefer to cook a good dinner rather then say useless words or give useless flowers
Same as most of Chinese Traditional men
Most of whom are middle-aged
I called dad, said that he could buy a pouch of shrimps and cooked them as a gift to mom
Because in my hometown accents, \"Shrimp\" and \"flower\" have the same pronunciation, called \"Hou
So this Valentine's Day, my mom received \"Hou\" as a gift and she was very happy
My dad also very happy because the \"shrimps\" not only show his true love to my mom at the special day, but also did not wasted even a cent
Heavy Cold
I've got a heave cold last week
At first, my nose is running and I can not help sneezing
Then one night, i felt my nose was totally stopping up, I could not breath at all
I had very bad sleep these days because of the nose problem
I can not get in sleep
Even at last I get in sleep, my sleep was not deeply and I was easy to wake up
Now my head is dizzy and my hearing is poor
When people talk to me the voice is like 30 miles away from me
It sense like a piece of paper covering my ear when I am hearing
I am a poor patient now
I hate to have cold
My nose is still stopping up when i typing these words down
I wish i can get better soon

I am so happy to hear that one of my best friend will get married this October
She said all the wedding preparation will do by her and her fiance
Because in China, most parents will undertaking almost all wedding preparation instead of their children do
Now my friend has 8 month to prepare stuffs until October
So they will have very beautiful wedding photo associate with good landscape
My friend also said that she will go to buy her wedding dress after May Day Holiday
Because in China, MDH is a big holiday and almost every emploies will have 3-7 paid-holiday, that means people have free time to be invited to weddings or other big issues
So many couples will choose MDH to celebravt their weddings
That scause the price increasing of  merchandise
And after the MDH, the prices will reduce to the normal standard
Hope she can found her own style

She knew I was very impatient and not going well
Then she went to the shrine to bought an amulet and secretly sent to me
When I received the amulet and letter, I was very surprised
In the letter,she said this amulet was she specifically went to the shrine to prayed that I could going well
After reading the letter, I was very touched
So I really treasure this amulet
Until now, Whether this amulet is working or not, I still take it with me everyday

Japanese end of a sentence (笑) is used

「Did I say that　!?」
Soften feel　sentences…？
You are not a foreignly　country
This is my new band , Final Liberty, and I uploaded my new song 'Evil Braze
This song is sang by Japanese, and growl is by me
I love guitar players influenced by Van Halen, this guy is very good at making melody line 
If you watch samurai X that is called rurouni kenshin in Japan, you may listened to their song called pure feeling that is one third
They made me to make songs like Van halen firstly
I like hard rock songs more than heavy metal maybe, but sometimes I want to listened to Manowar and Judaspriest
This is my first movie that I made, music　was made by me, and movie was made by Makoto Shinkai who made great animation movies in Japan
I thought if I make some MAD movies and send to some game company,  they would think I can make some music videos
Movies with music is necessary for video games, and this skill is needed in all of game companies, so I represent them I'm good at making games
This is my first step to goal
Please talk to me by skype , my skype ID is moemoekenchang 
I live in Tokyo, mitataka city, please add me 
Tell me how to speak English
My dream is to make theme songs of  Japanese hentai games
When you think of hentai games, you'll have negative image  maybe
But among these games, stories are great and songs are melodius
For example, this is theme song of Air
It have great ryrics and great melody, don't you think so
If songs I made is listened by anime fans and game fans , that is great and this is my goal of my life
I respect people who made these songs
My purpose to start Lang-8 is to meet a lot of game fans and anime fans in abroad
I want to make hentai game in the future and make theme songs by myself
But my wish is more stronger than others
I have made this movie for youtube and nikoniko movies, check this out
This song is great
This song is great
In 80's there are a lot of great bands in metal music
When I was in high school, I listened to radio and this song was on air
I was knocked out by Vivian's greart guitar solo
This song remainds me of high school days
I don't have friends, so I played the guitar in my room and thought someday I wanted to join a band and play heavy metal
Heavy metal is my life and this song gives me power 
In a village, they can't present what they think ,because they are afraid of being hated by other
Hated people will be ignored by other
Majority decide what is wrong and what is right, minority's thinking is ignored
Since I was born, this village is uncomfortable for me
Long time to no see
I have made original song and I see you it
This song is for my new band ' Final LIberty' 
Final Liberty is made by two people, 'Koyaken who plays the guitar,and programs score by computer, and Yoryu who sings songs 
To present abstract thinkings in English
In Japan we are forced to do like others from we are born
In erementary school, we are taught to protect conformity with people in our class
For example, when athletic meet is held, we are forced to march on like soldiers  in north korean
And if you make a mistake in such situation, you are scold by teachers
Not just in school, but also amang your friends , when we go to 'KARAOKE' you must sing songs your friends know
If you sing metal songs , you are　looked coldly at by your friends
So if you were in Japan , you should take care of conformity with others
I must get up early in order to play basketball at my university's gym

Now, airlines to ensure that as much as possible for us to make and it only depends on us whether we will use this service deliberately
Quite by chance I came across on the Internet on humans, the airline employee who knows how to simply pay less

If it goes smoothly, you can enter college earlier and have 2~3 more months summer vacation
The second one is to take the DRT(Department Required Test) in each beginning of summer vacation
Moreover, the DRT always puts focus on the most difficult parts of the courses, so most of the students rather give up courses of 3rd grade than take the DRT
They only have to fill the departments they want to enter in the form on the website of UAC, and wait for the result according to their grades
In other words, the grades make the decision
I think that the first way is better because it make schools and parents help students to find their target of life earlier
High school students in Taiwan must arrive school at 7:30 every day, and stay in school for 9 hours until 17:00
The admission will improve students' motivation of learning, and it may convince parents to give their children more free time
I exactly feel some pressure
Recently I am always think of the years when i was young，which was happy ，relaxing and there was no pressure
I'm looking forward the future 
It suggest via a picture that China has the dirtiest air condition full of tiny particles all around the country
The atmosphere here is even denser than that in Sahara Desert
It is said the particles, the diameter of which is small to a certain extent, can be easily inhaled to the finest part of our lungs, called \"Alveolus\", then may trigger some serious disease like cancer
This pic was taken just now（5:30pm） at my balcony 10-storey high，Guangzhou City
The len is towards west, supposing to capture some sunset scenery but totally vague here and the sun was just missing
One may think it is froggy but truely it is not the case as the weather is extremly muggy at the moment that you feel not that easy without an air-conditioner, with a temperature up to 30c and humidity up to 80
Actually, this weather condition is called haze, a common weather situation for Guangzhou these years

There are two-side in our life
One is happy, the other is unhappy
Whenever I receive client’s complaining e-mail, I feel it is a bad day
There are many ways to make me feel better
First of all, I will analyze reasons which make me getting involve in the trouble
Then, I will discuss with our team members to solve the existing problem
I know that worrying and sadly will ruin my thinking, thought I try to avoid these one
Secondly, If I can not solve the problem by myself, I will ask my supervisor to support me
My supervisor's advice is the best solutions for me, they are true in all times
Thirdly, I will think in positive way , because i know that everything always have root causes
I can handle the problem by exploring and solving all these roots causes
In my opinion, I think we should share our problems to everyone who you trust and do not give up is the best solution for all bad cases
We have not met for nearly two years
I just remind that we had great time in California
I and my wife are working as ticket seller, our schedule is not flexible
Moreover, my children just start school in few days, thus we could not able to join your party
I am so apologize that we miss your party
PS: My children also miss your children so much
Should be nervous or happy
I just received announcement that I will attend to new project on next Monday
It means that I should have more responsible to communicate with Clients who are native speaker
I do not dare about my technical skill, because I believe I can handle this project well
Any way, I should deals with this real thing
I will try to practice English regularly, especially in writing skill the most weak I am
Totally I get home so late from my company, that why I have no time to study at English center
I am very sad today, I would like to share my feeling to you
I just  scold my younger sister
She is studying 11th grade now
She ask me allow her come to her friend hometown
If I allow her go one time, may be another time she will also do it again and again
Because we live far from our family, I have responsible to take care her
My father always expect me to take care her, I cannot reject this mission
Unluckily we meet everyday
I know how much she sad, but I have to do in this situation
I prefer become hard person at the moment rather than comfortable person
Most of people like comfortable teacher rather than strict teacher
In the future they may remind and said themselves
I wish, If I have chance, or regret for everything has gone
I have to do even I don't want, because of a promising with my father
I am strict person, am I
I just want to sleep now, may be tomorrow may be better than
My favourite plact to relax

There are no supervisor, boss or colleagues observing our steps
How about your favourite place
is it cafe, beach, whatever it will be great for us
I'm looking forward to your correction
10th entry: \"In your opinion, why people raise money for charity? Have you ever done anything to raise money for charity
There are plenty of reasons raising money for charity
The most important reason is sharing luck to the Poor
As you know, Our social is developing rapidly, thus the living cost also increase quickly
As the result, the poor people are very hard to survive
People ready to give a hand to the poor who really needs our helps
Some people have a strong believe that, if we help someone right now, we will get more in the future
This belief has proved for many years
It is the truth, when we give charity to help the poor, we feels happy ourself
I also do charity whenever I have chance
Actually we have a charity fund in our company, each staff will become a member for contributing this fund
we always help the poor, especially children who have no chance to study
We help them by providing a the necessaries things like cloths, food and books as well
In my opinion, do charity is not always by giving money to the poor
As student we can do a thing such as spend time to the poor, working at charity organization
This is the fair life
I am looking forward to receive your valuable corrections or spend time for it

Can we live without dream
The first is become an IT (information technology) teacher
In personal, I wish I will bring the knowledge to my hometown which is still poor now
I believe there is no place thirsty knowledge than my hometown
There are a lot of people who have no chance to study at good environment, because of spending most of their time for earning money for life
Parents who are really want their children can go to school as others, but they must deal with the most difficult thing is money
To become a teacher is not only help me to share knowledge with them, but also I love this job much
I wish  I can establish a small education center
One side i will teach them how to use the computer,  the other side is created job for them by getting works from other companies
To reach my dream come true, I will try to get familiar job beside the software tester I do now
Because I work far from my parent, so I can only visit them on holiday
Luckily, I was encouraged from them about opening the center in my hometown
So I can take care both of them for all my life
That’s all about my dream

After I use this site, I have more chances to read other people's essaies
I studied English by myself before I know the site, so I didn't have chances to read them
Now, I can read a lot of essaies written by English learner
And I am surprised by their writing
They don't make a mistake in the sentences and use very nice words
Expressions are also good
I think about it more and more, I lose my confidence

Then, I tried to stop using this site
When I entered the site last, I found that someone corrected my First diary

After then, I tried to make more friends
Now, I've made many friends
And I interchange a lot of emails with them
It really helps me to study Enligsh, and I also study more harder

Presentation on this thursday
This semester I should do T
works
So I have to make a presentation in front of almost 400 freshmen this thursday
Most of them are good at english because they lived in english speaking nations
Following is my script to talk
Recently
Smartphones like iPhone and social network service like Facebook and Twitter are very popular
But Don’t you thing that it is a just beginning of something 
So our objective is design the next generation social network service or social network supporting tool that can be run on smartphone or handheld device, also that uses mobile sensors actively
Most important thing is to be a creative
during the project, you may have to deal with issues like privacy, security and usability
These are examples of current services but we are expecting your more brilliant idea
Than you may beat the Mark Zuckerberg who created Facebook in his dorm room in his 23 years old and now is the youngest billionaire in the world
I thought that I'd like to start writing in English so that I can good at English like native speakers
So I searched on the Internet a paid English writing correction service and fortunately I found this site, lang-8
At first, I doubted wheather it is a weired site or not but now I am satisfied this service after using it a couple of times
The mutually beneficial concept that \"I scratch your back, you scratch mine\" is not only attractive but it works well in reality
It is not because of money or a certain rewards, It is the good mind that motivates people to do something and it makes a community
And the community gives help to all the individual members in the community again
What an attractive structure it is
Altought this site is somewhat slow and it has inconvenient interface in a way, I hope this site will be thriving
I hope this site becomes a splendid space that I can make many friends to talk and know each other, also learn english
Thanks for all friends who read this

At first,the sunshine was not very bright because of some clouds and mist around it
But when it was about 8:14,the moon was started to cover the sun
It also means the beginning of partial eclipse
And then the sun appeared gradually and it was wholly showing his face about 10:45
At this moment of his emergence,I saw clearly that from the darkness there suddenly appeared a bright ray of light which was as shining as a diamond---so great and so beautiful
Likewise,my elder sister took some exciting photoes about the wonders today,although they are not very clearly due to the annoying clouds
So,I'm also very glad to show them for all of you

They are Japanese rock band, and are composed of four players
There are many cool songs
for example, \"Fire Cracker\",\"I hate it\",\"Space Sonic
However, they broke up their band in 2008
After that dispersion, the vocal of their band, Takeshi Hosomi started new band \"the Hiatus
This band is really cool, and the atmosphere of their songs are little different from the ELLEGARDEN's that
ELLEGRDEN is known as a rock(punk) band, and most of theri songs are up-tempo
But in the Hiatus, the type of each songs are different
Even though their songs are great, I hope ELLEGARDEN would restarted the activity
Good opinion or bad opinion any opinion is okay
I want to hear many thought
I think I need to study about the Philippines so I searched information about the Philippines through the internet
I found  Makati, where I'm going to, is known as the biggest business town in the Philippines
I want to look around the traditional view and eat Philippines food
I want to get friends with them and improve my English through the conversation
Does it mean something “evil”, likely one of the biggest challenges of modern human history, one of the toughest problems humankind ever faced since it’s on a global scale, its sheer enormity and complexity
And the Earth’s getting hotter and hotter means that the more and more solar energy is accumulating inside the Earth’s atmosphere
I see, the most difficult is that they’re not concentrated enough, the energy is distributed throughout a certain area so it’s not as easy as collect a piece of coal or nuclear material and burn it up
Why do they have to resolve the question about distributed energy by the size of the “power plants” e
g
huge wind turbines… I wonder why it’s so hard to get those kinds of energy
A typical question I often find out there is money
Yes, indeed, the only guy appear to be enough of money and capability is the US
And more its government can spend hundreds of billions of dollars to wage a war on some unlucky guys in the desert of the Middle East ( another glorious victory that hardly any other nation thinks they dare to do – overthrow a government with it military power ranks 4th in just a few weeks ), but it feels reluctant to spend more money on serious scientific and technical project that possibility change the world

International friendship football game　サッカーの国際親善試合
International friendship football game of Japan vs Korea was held at Seoul yesterday
At first half, Japanese attacked aggressively with short pass but Korean defended with their tough physical
In contrast with first half, Korean possessed the ball most of all time at latter half and there were the conclusive situations to goal but Japanese defender kept no goal at the end
Though it was a friendship match, both of teams did very excited game
Since next world cup will held at Brasil in 2014, I hope both of teams improve their technique and tactics till then and can get a game beyond the final 16 which was result of this year's world cup game

As my today's challenge, I used relative pronoun, but it's uncertain how to use
I was surprised to know that she is Momoe Yamaguchi
I know her name but I had thought she was just late 70's old idol and sang popular songs on that time
Her songs are not old even now, and the sounds are really rock'n roll
During a search about her, the fact she finished her career when she was only 22 astounded me again
I like her songs as one of the good rock music
Yesterday, the AFC (Asian Football Confederation) championship semi final match between Japan and South Korea held in Qatar
But they did
During the game, Japan ran well and South Korea showed tough physical and good ability
I didn't know members of South Korea well, but after kick off the match, I was surprised they are very tall and young
They played very gentle, I want to clap and cheer them
However there was the only one disappointing thing
I thought referee got fouls easily than usual
If there was nothing, we could watch more exciting dynamic match
Anyway I'm crossing my fingers that both teams can win next games
The day before yesterday, we the lab member held the Imoni party
Imoni party is a kind of the BBQ making the pot filled with aroid, Chinese cabbage, green onion, carrot, meat, and so on and mainly organized in Tohoku region which is located in northern part of Japan
In autumn, a lot of smoke of the Imoni party can be seen every near river in Tohoku
In my living town Sendai, the pot is dressed with miso and use pork
The taste is like tonjiru which is one of the gorgeous miso soup with full of vegetables
In the neighbor prefecture Yamagata, they use the soy souse as the main dressing material and use beef
Sweetly and salty taste evoke the Sukiyaki
Since next year I am going to go to the Kanto region, this time Imoni party might be the last time for me
Imoni party was very enjoyable but that idea made me a little bit concern
The picture was shot few years ago

I am going to write about Japanese university life mainly
In Japan, there are tons of news mentioned recent difficulties for university students to hunt  job
Unfortunately, the rate of student who could get work till October in this fiscal year goes down to 58% from 63% of last year
And there are a lot of controversies about what is the main problem
There are a lot of work especially middle and small companies
They only apply big famous companies
If students learned their limitations well, they could get work
Other insist, \"There are too many students than ever
The amount of university students has been increasing, it's double compare to 1990
Now, degree of undergraduate is less special than used to be
Most of their opinions are hard for students
So, the students who are exhausted or getting angry for the job hunting took demonstration
University isn't preparation facility for hunting job
Japan is in the depression right now
In these days, my eyes have been getting tired because I've spent much time sitting in front of display
I usually experiment in lab and analysis the data by computer
When I feel being exhausted, seeing news of the world was my favorite way to rest
It was good for my feeling but not for my eyes(xx
So I bought Rubik's cube
At first, I couldn't do well though I saw the operating manual
But after exceeding 5 times making, I learned how to make Rubik's cube correctly
My next target is to make cube fast like below
Distance to him seems to be long
Sendai is getting cold a little and autumn is coming there
I like autumn because I like the color of brown and fallen leaves
Fallen leaves make me feel fragility of life
I like the sound when I step on the leaves
Anyway, I've been belonging track and field club for 11 years from the junior high school
Since I'm a relatively thin, high jump is my event ever
Today, Sendai has clear autumn sky, temperature which is not too hot or cold just right make me relax
It is very comfortable to lie on the mat of the high jump and stare absently into sky in the fair weather like today
In fact maybe over 5 or 6 hours meeting will start soon(xx
Science cafe
I am going to start the work from next year
But I'm already a little bit scared though I haven't started working and known about work　well
So I frequently imagine the past retirement years
And I like cafe, too
So I want to integrate science and cafe, and will name it science cafe
I hope there are a lot of scientific stuffs, astrometric telescope, test tube with flowers, gas burner on the table, flask as a drink shaker, and vacuum tube amplifier for good music
In holiday seasons, children come to play and study 
After the every imagination for a while, I disappoint remembering the debt for scholarship I've ever lent
If there were good application of the scientific devices for the cafe, I want to know
It has past several weeks that I had post last diary
During a recent few weeks, I had been practicing for the Ekiden meet organized by electrical faculty of the graduate university
First, I will try to explain about Ekiden simply
But the big difference between full marathon and Ekiden is running alone or not
In Ekiden, runner equips a Tasuki which is like a towel bonding its edges as a baton
To express the appearance of the Tasuki is very difficult :p
Each runner runs own course and gives the Tasuki to the next runner
So we had the Ekiden meet at last Saturday
2 years ago, we could get 5th prise and last year was 4th prise
Since we had good freshman and practice, we could get 3th prise
So, we could have the most enjoyable time in the Oden party after the Ekiden for recent 3years
I hope junior colleagues would get the more good result in next year
I'm now watching Egypt demonstration on Web TV

One day, She served the meal to him
He ate and said “Oh,this bread is nice and tastes good.”
But suddenly she got anger and said “you want to say only bread is nice and my cook isn’t good don’t you?”
He was surprised at her saying
Of course he didn’t mean it
The other day, after the meal, he said to her “I had your meal deliciously.”
and then she got angered and said “ you want to say my cook is bad and you managed to eat the meal deliciously for your effort.”
Following the day, he told me about it and told he doesn’t know what he should say
to her
Are those example just difference of thinking between men and women
or should he choose what he say carefully

When I was elementary school student, at that time rollerskating is so had populared
So I used to play with my friends every day
One day, I played with 2friends rollerskating
Suddenly I slipped and fell, my left ankle sprained
It was really really painful
Two friends approached me and said \"are you Ok?\" 
actually I wasnt ok cause I felt nearly die but I replied I'm ok
As It was so painful I couldnt dare to go home alone by walk 
but my character is a little ______(not outgoing) 
so I couldnt ask to help me
One friend said me \"shall I take you home
I said by courtesy \"no, I can go home alone\" (OK
at that time the other friend said to one friend 
dont care, she said she can go home alone
Though I was really really painful so I couldnt think anything 
but then I could think this
Bitch!!' :-(  I could certify our friendship
Anyway finally I said I will go home alone and went to home alone nealy creeping
Arrived at home I (kept my bed
confined to my bed?) and next day I wore a cast
After, though I went through that happening I got along with the other friend well but I hate her and really thanked to one friend
First, I still blamed in my mind after parted from her
but since when I dont remember her name just remember the kind friend
I watched one movie to familiar with British English accent
It's teenage movie
so, though its story is obvious, but handsome lead man made me happy:D
As I watched that movie about 4~5times, the OST is quite accustomed to hear
The band 'The stiff dylans
The man is a part of the band in movie, then they sang 2songs
One is 'Ever fallen in love', the other is 'ultraviolet
Good looking TVstar is better, but for singer, having attractive voice is best important thing to me
After watched that movie, I connected England site, because I couldnt find, download the band's songs
I found their songs more and one site where I can download variety songs
Oops, actually, 'Ever fallen in love'isnt their song and there's many version sang many singers
I love the stiff dylans' ver
Before this movie, my favorite is 'mamma mia'OST
Already as you know, all those things are ABBA's famous songs
Of course I had known their a few songs, but had done like very much
My hero is patriots
It was about second grade in elementary school when I thought about my hero at first
One day, the teacher gave me a paper which ask a few things about me
In this questions, there was this 'who do you respect
but I haven't my hero
So I started to think someone who is worthy to answer that question
I thought up soneone
He is King Seo-Jong
He made Han-gul with scholars to help his nation
At that time, we used chinese character
We borrowed and create won law to mark
But it wasn't real our's and there was lots of unlettered person yet
After I determined him of my hero, He is my hero but unreal hero
Time goes by, at high school, I liked the subject 'Korean morden history' from the era Joseon to now
Actually though I'm not good at Korean history, I used to get good grade on korean morden history
I don't know you know that (How can I revise this sentence more naturally?) korea was a colony of Japan
There were many people who flattered Japan and when Japanese chased the patriots, some traitors helped Japanese
The other side,  there were so many patriots
They resisted not just the forces also writting like poems, novels..(especially I like resistive poem
They were not afraid of death, ro rather, some patriots sacrificed themselves for contry
Can I do that if happen again
I really thanks to them and every ancestors who make efforts to protect our culture and Han-gul and so on
One thing more, It's too unpleasant to me that the descendants who is traiots' are very wealthy, as they inherited many things which got by flattering Japanese
But patriots' descendants are really poor, as their father or grandfather gave-up their family to devote himself(Usually men
Then their family couldn't afford to get education well, cause they also hard to just keep their daily meals
I want to that they get more respects
I, however, have grown up at Tokyo
Everytime I come back to Tokyo and find th Tokyo Tower, I feel relaxed
I work for a trading company which gets fossil fuel from Asian countries such as China and Indonesia, and sells them iron manufacturers, power plants, papermaking company, and so on

I'd like to briefly describe some of the chinese spring festival
I had prepared a lot of food, such as dumplings, meat balls, fish, etc in the new year's eve like previous spring festival, so that I don’t need to buy anything during the vacation
I had stick couplet on two side of the door of parents house, after then I work some firecracker, eating dumplings, spring festival gala play on TV, while my family spent whole day with my parents at their house
And my family had spend the whole day with my parents at the first day of Chinese New year
My family spend whole day with my parents in law in the at the second day of the lunar new year
I had had dinner with close friends, relation and colleagues for drinking with wine at third day, fourth day and sixth day
I had gone to  Catacombs to worship the ancester at fifth day by Tradition
I had gone to workplace start to work at seventh day
The mandarin is the language that many kinds of north nomads or minority nationality enter or invaded the Central Plains had been belonging to Han nationally in ancient Chinese, then imitate and try to speak to the ancient han nationality, then learning not too good, so became the so called mandarin
So I think that those place with dialect of south of the Yangtze River is more like or close the sound of ancient Han nationality especially cantonese and inland Min dialects almost as the ancient han nationality
Those explains Why Cantonese literature is so rich and diverse while Mandarin literature in China so poor and shallow
Maybe you want to know which animal year you belong to by Chinese 12 Animals year or Chinese 12 zodiac
The Chinese animal year resembling constellation in the west
The chinese people like to own the animal's character is his character
Chinese today are tend to contrast animal character with animal year belong to themselves

Because They didn't allow me to work part-time near my house
The volunteer is planed by my university
Because I like talk with other people
For example, I had to go home until sunset when I was a high school student
I have to go home until 10 p.m. now
And They don't like me to work part-time
I quarrelled with them about an hour
I cried a little then because They wouldn't understand me
I wanted to understand me
Then,my young brother help me
Finally,they understood me and allow me to work part-time
I want to work part-time on Wednesday,Saturday and Sunday
But they didn't allow me to do it on Sunday
But,My elder brother called them today
He is living in Nagoya to go to his university
He is 3rd grade student at a university
He said them that he would work part-time near his house
they said him \"it was good
I was angry in my heart
Today,my brother and I helped my mother make mandarin juice
But,We had to use many mandarins to make it
so we had to carry them from field to our house

After that,my brother and I had lunch
After that,my brother and I helped my father feed cows

Goog night
Kitashima who was an important person of us
The concert was held at the musical instrument musium and it was great
Three friends of mine in Hamamatsu were going to travel by a camping car the evening
They didn't plan where to stay as usual
It was extraordinalily warm and comfortable that I hadn't known at all
Next morning when the car passed over Kobe, I made my mind not to get off the car but to go to Hiroshima together with them
The water was low when we visited(I forgot how to describe this), so we were able to walk to the gate
There is a mountain called Misen where a famous Buddhism monk, Kuukai opened a saint place
It is only 500 meter something high(I don't know how to say 500何メートル
Our stomach was not big enough to taste all of them
They were going to find a good onsen or hot spring the night
I remembered that an old friend boutht a condo opposite Miyajima recently
She recommend a good onsen nearby that she just went the previous day
She never told me what to do but she was helping me make the goals clear and how to accomplish them myself
We decided which day of the week and what time we talk over the phone on what would be going regularly
The next day, Hamamatsu friends went to another island named Shodo-shima, and I took a local train back to Kobe
It cost about 4,000 yen cheaper than shinkansen, but it took over 5 hours
I couldn't buy any food or drink till the second station because of no time
5 piesces of gum eased me
I enjoyed myself looking out of the window
There were lots of green, pink and purple colours in the mountains
I went back to normal yesterday
My friends were in Shikoku now and they are going to drop by my place tomorrow
Next week after this long holiday, they are going to Tohoku, the affected area by the earthquake and tsunami, by that camping car to help them clean the damaged things
A very good news from the affected area
This is a very good news
Just now, a 80-year-old lady and a 16-year-old boy were rescued from the place under lots of debris in Ishinomaki in Miyagi pref

おひさしぶりです
It's been a while since I last wrote an entry journal here
I'm sorry I haven't replied to each message yet that I received during the period I was absent, but I really appreciated them
I'm going to have a small operation at a hospital this week
I can't seem to be able to go to Tokyo this time
Luckily, she came to Kyoto for a four-day trip this Monday, so I went to see her yesterday
There is a famous temple named of 東寺(Toji) near Kyoto station, and a big antique market is held on 21st of every month
Yesterday was the day
We met at the station about 10:30 and walked there
There were lots of people gathering and lots of stores selling old kimonos, foods, hand crafts as well as antiques
I found an interesting carved ornament which was 38,000 yen
We walked around for a while, however, there were too many people and too many things to have a careful look
Nice smell attracted us
We joined them at once
They called it いか焼き(ika-yaki), and it was quite small and 200 yen that
I thought that was why it was popular
There were chairs to sit
A foreign couple were sharing a piece sitting next us
It was interesting to see the girl taking lots of かつおぶし(katsuo-bushi) or slices of dried bonito aside
She seemed to have hated it
We also enjoyed seeing lots of statues inside the builidngs of the temple that showed 曼荼羅(Mandala) or Buddhism's heaven and earth
One of the statues named 帝釈天(Taishaku-ten) riding an elephant was really handsome
Also, we entered a five-story pagoda or 五重塔(gojuu-no-tou
I didn't know that it was built as a grave of some saints and it was burnt out four times after it was first built in 883 but it never collapsed by earthquakes
Before leaving there early 4:00, I dropped by the store again to just see the carved ornament once again, and then, surprisingly, the shope person started to give me a discount
He said, \"It is very good, but you can buy it for 8,000 yen.\" I couldn't belive it because he was going to make it 30,000 yen cheaper
I started to check it carefully, and then he even said, \"OK, it's just 7,000 yen
Please take it.\" How can you discount 31,000 yen
I talked to myself, \"Perhaps, it was not as good as the price from the beginning.\" Customer's mind, it's funny, isn't it
We took a train this time on the way back to the station, we rode only one-station distance, though
After buying 駅弁(ekiben) or colourful delicioius meal in a box, we talked again about the future planning at a cafe for a while
We had a really good time and said good-bye about 5:30 p.m
I would really appreciate if you correct wrong usages and unnatural expressions of mine
I thought it was just 'tissues' even though it is pocket-sized, but I was not sure then
How about the case of tissues, which is made of bamboo, plastic or wood
It's a lovely weekend today

For example, When I said \"go out in society\" in some sentence, He said I should use \"start working\" in stead
In addition, he also said \"international situation\" can be paraphrase \"what's going on in the world\", and \"feature\" can  said \"what makes us different
I become stressed when I learn the way of thinking that are shown in the expression of Japanese and English languages

According to an  korean article, 40 percentage of overweight people are  in the world and the number is  increase rapidly
some peole say that, obesity  cause not only   diseases but also lose  self -confident
so,  what sould peole do to reduce a weight 
To begin with, the  most important   thing  is to make a plane for diet
As you know, obesty people prefer high calories foods such as hot-dog, pizza, chocolate
They have to limit for  eating those  food  to avoid fat 
when they buy foods 
After then, make a list a  diet card and put it  on a fridge
They can check daily intake of  foods
It is  essential to pretect  gluttony
Second, they need to  exercise regulary
the expert say that only  law calorie food is   not  enough to  lose  weight
Exercise and  diet food sould go hand   in hand 
However, some of fatness people avoid physical exercise because, they get diseases alredy  such as   hypertension and  rheumatism 
Also  most of them just  keep away  exercise steadily
Taking a exercise should   encourage to take off  fat and for  stimulattion blood circulation 
Third,  attending a group meeting  is a  good way to mindcontrol 
they can share variety of  imformation  with  different experience
Morever,  if  they  know  who  succed  in   diet    it  will be a  good role model for  them
In conclusion,  and i mentioned, im strongly suggest  to overweight poeple who want to   live for  health life
They will spend  tough time to make a goal  
however ,  if   you  control  your minds  and  body condition, you will be successful  
no gains no pains

Do you think Japanese government should accept more immigrants
I agree with the statement that Japanese should accept more immigrants from abroad to solve problems of declining birthrate and aging population
A number of immigrants want jobs in Japan and they work hard because they want to make change
However in other ways, for example, raising taxes would end up to force people live less happily
I don't want to work after I get 65 yeas old because of lack of the savings and decreased pension
On the contrary, what is the problem of accepting more immigrants
These problems are not big deal
We will be able to solve them by discussing and understanding of cultural differences of each other
All in all, immigrants are powerful solution for aging society
Japanese government should change the policy
Talking with foreigners is much fun
Why don't we live together and make wonderful life with cultural exchange

He brought to me two good news
One news was that he had a baby boy on Friday night, just two days before
It was a good glad news
Another was that one of our friends got married last week
He said to me directly nothing about his marriage, so it was surprising for me
Yes, I was very glad to hear these good news
It is a bad manner to chew gums loudly with a mouth open
They come to the office, sit at their desk, open a bottle of chewing gums, and begin loudly chewing almost every morning
The loud noise bothers me and hinders to concentrate on my work
I don't want to argue them on such a silly slight trivial thing, so I push earplugs into my ear canals everyday
I can concentrate on my job and improve in efficiency more than expected with wearing the earplugs
Why don't you try it, if you want to concentrate on anything
We discussed with our colaboratory members in Netherlands
We could discuss with foreign researchers at Japan office
We need not to go to Netherlands, and they need not go to Japan
In the truth, I want to go there once
Anyway, we had a very fruitful exciting discussion yesterday
I was sorry I was not used to the web meeting, I could not speak well
I thought I have to speak more and I want to be able to speak more in English
Wow, it started raining again right now
The sun and the rain in the summer should be necessary for producing crops in the autumn and so on
We have to take care not to get heat attack and enjoy this hot summer
We have a busy week, and at last it is Friday, that is the day before weekend
We deserve to refresh or enjoy on the weekend if we have done hard work during the week
Today is the last day before summer holidays
I can't wait tomorrow
We will have some cleaning and checkup facilities in our lab today
I will have some meeting and interview, too
However, it's Friday before summer holidays
Anyway, after the work, I will step into summer holidays
We played on a well treated beautiful lawn playground
Clay one are common
Lawn grounds are softer and more comfortable than clay one, but treatments are more necessary for keeping the ground conditions
I read some books in these days during the summer vacation
Essays and novels, including classic novels and recent hit novels, were read
Some were interesting, the others were difficult so as to want to read again, and rest were just time-killing
I read the books in the train and in home at night
When I was reading, sometimes I dropped off to sleep
I went  slipping into the novel's story world
Or I got bored of the book and had a nap
Too difficult ones and too boring ones were good for dozing off
Please read good books and have a good sleep as well
For practicing for next month's half marathon
I ran on the actual course of the next month's half marathon with more than ten friends for practicing
At not so fast pace, we sometimes chatted while running
We will run a half marathon or a 10km race on the race day
We made a good preparation for them
We saw plum blossoms and early cherry blossoms blooming on the way
We had a running event, but it was heavily raining unfortunately
However, we are crazy for running, so over 20 runners, including me, joined the event and ran in the pouring rain
The road seemed like a river with flood
Some cars threw water to us from pods
I was sure we looked stupid
But we really enjoyed running the full marathon in the bad and funny condition
After the goal of the marathon, we went to a hot spa and enjoyed it
I went to watch the \"Super-8\" movie yesterday
I think I should not say the story here in detail
It is made from some previous movies by Spielberg
It is said adequate workout help you keeping your health
I think walking is the easiest workout for almost everyone from young to old people
The pedometer count your steps when you put on it automatically
It is fun, even funner than expected
I recommend that
More than ten thousands steps a day is appreciate daily target to achieve
I entered for the next Tokyo Marathon
It will be held in the next February
The entrants will be chosen by lottery
I could run the last one luckily
They say that there is the way to make your dream come true, which consists of very simple three steps
First, note your dream down on a paper
Second, put the paper on the wall and see it everyday
Well, I got it, I think it would be sure to succeed
I will write my dream on a pad to realize it
The dream, or the goal, would be preferable to being SMART
That is written in some books of self-development
We have the Hydrangea Festival in the town next to my city on last weekend and this weekend
Hydrangea is very popular in Japan
It blooms in June and is the symbol of the rainy season
Red, blue, purple, pink, white, many various colored flowers are very cute and beautiful with its vigorous green leaves especially in the rain
Its flowers is said to vary its colors by the pH of the soil
At the festival, we have some ceremonies, concert, and the other events as well as free appreciation of  hydrangeas planted along the street and footpaths between rice fields
At first, cutting its branches, arranging about 10cm length, cutting the edge sharply, and sticking them into soil in small pot, and then watering enough not to dry up for some weeks
Some of the branches took root successfully and grows in the pots
Winter returned here
Take good care not to get cold, everyone
By the way, do you know of \"Nagori-yuki
Yuki\" means snow, \"Nagori\" means like lingering farewell, I think
Nagori-yuki\" is a kind of snowfall in spring
It sometimes snows in March around Tokyo, or also in southern part of Japan
In March, spring has already come, and no snow are there usually
In spring, we start a new life, like entering schools, getting new jobs, therefore we may have to move to new places
We may have to leave someone then
There might be a sentimental scenes here and there
We are reluctant to leave them at a station platform or somewhere
Just at the moment, it starts snowing sentimentally even dramatically
We call the snow \"Nagori-yuki
So it doesn't mean just snow in spring
Some sentimental meaning is included in \"Nagori-yuki
Nagori- yuki\" is the name of a popular song originally, I'm sorry I'm not sure
My own \"Nagori-yuki\" was
at a long long time ago
I had left my girlfriend at a station platform of my hometown and came to Tokyo about quarter century ago
Anyway, it is one of my precious memories, hahaha
Is it unconscious or conscious
Yes, I did it rather consciously
I have to make it a habit to wake up early absolutely
My older friends came back to my office
An older friends of mine, who had retired from work two years ago, came back to work at our section as a senior stuff from yesterday
He had been also the former manager of our soccer club
I like him and respect him
So I feel surprised and a little difficulty to work with him right now, but I am sure we will be able to get along at our work
Saturday is a holiday from work for our office usually
It is a substitution for the day that we can't work due to the rotational power cut
We have an occasional working calendar corresponding the rotational power cut
Yesterday was a rest day
I enjoyed gardening yesterday
Picking up weeds, cutting grass, trimming some branches of trees, watering and fertilizing them, blur, blur, blur
By the way, we have holidays called \"Golden Week\" from yesterday April 29th, that is \"Midori no hi\", to May 5th, \"Kodomo no hi\", in Japan
I took a day off today, so I have seven-day consecutive holidays
Haha, not any
Each of my family has stuffs of themselves respectively
So we can't go on a trip to somewhere altogether
But I will go cycling to Kamakura with my wife
The short trip by bike is annual event of us two
I signed up for Tokyo Yumemai Marathon on Oct
I am going to run 4 times
Not a time race, but an interesting 42.195km sight seeing race
Expensive purses will make you rich
Your attitude and behavior, which the purse bring you, may make you an rich person
Expensive purses suit only rich people, which I agree with, but I can't believe the purses you make rich
The first working day in 2011
Today is the first working day in 2011 of my office
I have to work hard, as hard as last year, or rather harder
Anyway, I am afraid it will be very cold in the building after several holidays without heating, you know
Since I got the new tasks, new goals, new schedule, and new coworkers, I have a lot of things to learn about my new work
Moreover, I have a lot of various things which are new for me every day, even every hour
With my previous work at the former section, I rarely went to the headquarters
It was only once per two or three years, I'm not sure
On the other hand, with the new work, I go there once per two or three weeks
I'm afraid I don't like taking a train very much, especially crowded trains in metropolitan area
Overslept
The electric power was planed to cut off yesterday evening, but it was cancelled at my place luckily
We have hand lights in our house for the power cut
There is one this evening today
Fuji, that is the highest mountain in Japan as you know
I write it because I can remember a dream unusually
In my dream, I watched a football game of Japan versus England national team on TV
Japan team got goals on and on
A sportscaster was very excited and shouted at every goal
When scored 5-1, I awoke from the dream and got up
I wonder what mine was, getting the dream like this
Natalie Portman as the heroine acts the main ballerina of the Swan Lake ballet
She got the Academy Award through this roll
The movie was very interesting and it was for matured people because it contained some scenes which are not good for child
I went to my office after the 4 day business trip today
Some time flied at the office in my absence
My busyness is still, or even increased unfortunately
It seems never-ended
Some grass turn yellow in this hot summer
It has been beautiful green in the winter and the spring
However, I got an useful information
It is called a burn by fertilizer
We must not apply fertilizer too much to grass especially in the mid summer
A lot of plants become vigorous in these days in our garden
There are Lawn grasses, rosemaries, lavenders, daisies, hedge trees, and so on, including many plants which name I don't know
New buds and leaves are budding there
We feel happy in the Spring while seeing them growing up with vigor
Have nice Spring days, all friends
I took a TOEIC test after work yesterday
I am afraid if I could have done it well but I got it done anyway
We have to concentrate on the the speaker's voice of the listening test especially, but it was hard for me to do so yesterday
I suppose you that you had better not take like this tough test on Friday evening after work
It is because you would probably be tired from the all week work and surely find it difficult to concentrate on your test for a long time
I could rather enjoy taking the test this time
I like English more than before
That seems why I could enjoy the test
That is thanks to you here in Lang-8, even partly at least
I appreciate you from my heart
The result will be received in two weeks
I wonder if I could get a higher score than before or not
The exhibitions consisted of three of them, which were new generation lights, functional films, and these manufacturing technologies
The lights section showed us many kinds of lights of the new generation
Those were mainly LEDs and organic LEDs
LEDs consumes much lower electricity power than fluorescent light tubes
They also demonstrated a large size of the 3D displays which we don't need to wear 3D glasses to watch
The largest one was 70 inch size
I got a kindle
I was sure that it is very good device
The electric paper display is very easy to read, even easier than LCD displays of PCs
I love it at the first sight
I will read books written in English and improve my English skill
Fruitful visit to representative offices
We went three ones, which are from Belgium, Finland and Germany
And the representative person who talked with us were Japaneses or foreigners from their country
Thanks to study here in lang-8, I could managed to have discussion in English
The discussions mainly consisted of introduction and presentation about the institutes and the activities of them, and we made many questions
We could have very fruitful discussion and got a lot of new informations and knowledges
We had good visits there
I would like to visit the foreign research institute in their own countries and know more about them
There are a small path named \"Omoide-Yokocho\" in the western side of Shinjuku Station
The path and bars have Showa Retro Style, it looks like it is not changed for long time from Showa era
It was my first visit to the path
We enjoyed drinking some beer and other drinks and yakitoris  with very reasonable price
I want to go for Karaoke to refresh myself
I like Karaoke, but it's a long time since the last time I went singing to Karaoke
I guess that singing songs loudly is very fun and very good for refreshing
I think it is one of the greatest inventions of Japan
How do you like Karaoke
He will quit a job at our office at the end of March
He is one of the targets of corporate restructuring
He leaves for another job
We, he and I, have been at the same group for about five years, since 2005
He was a group leader of our group
Therefore, I got shocked and felt something betrayed when I heard the news of his change of job
To say the truth, I was sorry I didn't think he was enough to be a leader of our group, so I often argued with him about the management
But this is also true that I respect him a lot as a good engineer and I like him as a good elder friend
Anyway, we miss him
We wish his every success in his new job as well as his health
Best wishes for him 
I ran a marathon, 42.195km, yesterday
It was too hot to run a long distance, even to do any other exercise outdoors
I poured water over my head some times too
I ran in the shade as possible to minimize the exposure to direct sunlight
It was very tough again, but I did it
I want a good boots
I am planning to buy a boots
I am wondering which boots I will buy, and browsing on the web
For example, as for work boots, there are many types of work boots
I can't decide which one to get yet
March 21th is the Spring Equinox Day
The day time and the night time are equal on the Spring Equinox day
We have three straight holidays
Today is the last day of the holidays
I have a lot of stuffs to do
We took 3D glasses to watch it
The computer graphics are very beautiful and look nearly real
The story is fun and easy to understand
It is impressive with its theme between the human as invaders and the former inhabitants on the planet
I guess it is one of the \"must see\" movies
The battery was dead in the train back home yesterday
What do you think of that

Longing for good news
He has been very nervous these couple of days
But it seemed to me that he was enjoying getting nervous
According to him, he can NOT be nervous before the exams, because that may affects his performances, but before the announcements, he doesn't need to be anxious for his performances, so he CAN get nervous without restraint
He believes he can pass the examination
He says he is confident to have got it done well
He  is well optimistic
The announcement will be conduct at the university at about 1 o'clock today
I really hope he can pass it
I'm sure he will
I can't help waiting the news
I AM also nervous
I use up ballpoint pens and replace the refills
That is a trivial thing, I know
I will replace to a new refill into the 100yen ballpoint pen
It is a kind of the ecology
We have a lot of work for an important decision making next week
We spent a lot of time for discussing, researching, and making reports and agendas for it
Unfortunately, the progress of our work is not working as well as expected
I think this seems usual
Besides, I had job interviews as an interviewer with applicants from universities
I left home to my office at six in the morning
I left my office to a business trip at seven
I left the visit to my office at noon
I left my office to home at a few minute to the  midnight
Somewhat tough for me as a convalescent
It was too hot to have a good sleep last night
I woke up sometimes
I got out of bed to turn on the fan at last
We will have some sleepless night in the summer
To mow the loan
It is two week after last mowing
To cut branches of a berry tree
It grows very fast in this season
To wash my car
I think it is about a month after last time
To clean my desk and my room
To watch dramas and movies recorded in the HDD recorder
I want to do, but I can't do this probably
To go for a jog for refreshing myself
To buy my daughter a new pair of running shoes
To have a good relax time and have some rest
How to manage to change sports outfits into office clothes
I run to work and back home almost everyday
It is a great way to start a new day and finish work of the day
I can change my mind by running from the working mode to the private mode and vice versa
I introduce you how I manage to change my sports outfits into my office clothes
I can't work at office in my dirty wet sport outfits, it's weird, you know
Luckily, there is a locker for me at a locker room in my office building
I change my sport outfits to my office uniforms there
I bring some extra sport outfits like shirts and shorts and underwear with me in my backpack every morning, and keep them in my locker
So I can run back home in clean dry outfits
I also have to change my sweaty underwear to clean one some times in a day in warm season
And after finishing my work in the office uniforms, I run back home while bringing the dirty wet outfits and underwear back home everyday in my backpack
There must not be limits for anything
You only set the limits on yourself to do anything
You have infinite abilities and possibilities for everything
You can do anything you want to do and you can get it done better than you thought
Therefore you have to try and push on while getting your limits off
What do you think about it
I usually end up setting limits on myself for doing something
Those \"you\" are suitable for  these sentences
Or \"we\" are better than \"you
Busy week
Another busy week started
It was just midnight when I arrived at home after the long long riding train from the business trip
We hope spring come soon. 
Plum flowers has been blooming for several days
We hope spring come soon
But I feel hay flies in the air
I have to put on masks in spring
I want to enjoy taking photo with M42 lenses again
I have sold some of my M42 lenses out of my collection
I used them before, but I hadn't used them for more than five years
Well, while selling the lenses, I feel like taking photographs with those lenses by myself again
Therefore I bought an used digital camera and a mount adapter for old M42 mount lenses
Digital camera is cheaper and more affordable than 5 years ago
And it does not need the development cost
I got an used one with a very reasonable price
I write my journals almost everyday
And my posts are corrected and commented by someone
I am sorry I have neither time nor idea for posting today
The Somei-Yoshino kind of cherry trees are now on time
We enjoy seeing and drinking some alcohol
24h relay marathon
We signed up for the 24 hours relay marathon held at Hiratsuka Sougou Kouen Park on September
Eight runners in our team will run the relay
What do you think about a 24 hours relay
Sounds like that exciting, doesn't it
It will be very tough, even extremely tough, but at the same time, it may probably be a funny and enjoyable event like some big festivals
We will enjoy running and also rest time with buddies
It is my first 24 hours relay
Do you know the internet banking service
I have a bank account on one of the internet banks
But I found it useful, for example, to pay through a bank transfer for internet shopping
I bought something by bank transfer via the internet banking
It was cloudy and chilly but little windy, so it was a good condition for running
I ran three marathons in a week, which are on Saturday, Sunday, and Thursday
It is incredible to run 100 marathons every single 100day in a row
He is an incredible 60's
Acupuncture ease her
My daughter received acupuncture to ease her recent mental condition, like nervous and  irritating, and unstable
The acupuncture worked to her surprisingly very well
She got better and much more positive as before
I'm not sure but I think she had some tense or fatigue in her body, which brought her nervous, anxious, and another negative feelings
The acupuncture arranged and cured her tense of nerve, I don't know well
It seems like the summer is back
The temperature in the daytime is more than 30 degrees
However, it is cooler in the morning and evening with pleasant autumn breeze
We also feel pleasant breeze in the shade even in the daytime
One of our colleague will leave our laboratory on the end of this week
She has been working in our laboratory as a temp staff, and she found her permanent job
We are very sorry to lose her but very pleased that she get her new job she has wanted
Well, I drank too much yesterday, I have some hangover now
We should have face-to-face communication
Got flu
My son got flu
He has some fever, throat pain and fatigue, but they all are not severe
He took the effective medicine, Tamiflu, and has been resting in bed
I hope he would get well soon
And we are afraid if his flu would infect my daughter
Because she has an interview of the entrance exam to the high school next Monday
In recently, I wrote bad to whom chews loudly here, so does God punish me with this
Gave the lawn a fertilizer
I gave the lawn a fertilizer this morning
First, about 10 gram powder of urea fertilizer, which is two or three scoops by a tablespoon, was solved and diluted to 5 litters of water in a watering pot
And the dilute solution of the fertilizer was given to the lawn, 2 to 3 litters per a square meters
This urea fertilizer is very efficient for the growth of the grass, especially good for greening the leaves
The lawn in my garden turned yellow by the severe heat in this summer
So I'd like to make them recover and want to green them again
I wish the fertilizer help them recover
Finding a apartment for my son
I went to Tokyo for finding an apartment for my son who will start a new single life in Tokyo
It is his first time to live alone
We were very lucky to have found a very nice one and sighed up for it
I feel kind of lonely for missing him
We hope he is growing up to be an nice adult
Warlords and us at Odawara 2-Day March
This photo was taken at the finish point of the route after 20km walk
They were stuffs of the event who costumed as warlords of the Sengoku era which was several hundred years ago
The white wall with the piled stones was a part of the Odawara castle
Maybe we also had to put on protectors and helmets like them, hadn't we
Just to tell you, usual Japanese like us don't have such uniforms and protectors, of course
That's why I turned to a shorter route to the office and ran in the rain sometimes with an umbrella and sometimes not
I was not very soaked when arrived at the office
No, not only these days, but almost all days, I am busy
I worked long overtime this week, especially
I was at office until around the midnight some days in a week
I am now suffering from some lack of sleep
I will have some rest on this weekend
Have a good Friday and good weekend, all my friends
Get and Sell on the internet auction
I get some goods on internet auctions, for example, used watches, shoes, clothes, cameras, and so on
It is good enough to get something at reasonable price
And sometimes I sell something I don't use any more on internet auctions
It is very good way to reuse things and to clean my house
I sold ten old cameras of my collection recently
I didn't think no one would want them, but almost all of them were bid and sold
To reduce wastes, to reuse things, and to recycle is good way to reduce carbon dioxide and is eco-friendly
Do you know how to cheer yourself up when you are in a tough, difficult, hard situation, or something like that 
I have the magic words for cheering me up
I tell you what
The words are 
It's a showtime 
I suggest you to say the words to yourself when you find yourself in tough situations
If you say so, you could make you stronger to conquer something such as a problem and you could succeed in ending it or dealing with it successfully, I believe
It is very easy for you to say only a few words, isn't it
Graduation ceremony of my daughter
There will be the graduation ceremony of my daughter's junior high school
There was one of my son's high just some days ago
My wife and I will attend it this time
My daughter will play the piano accompaniment at the ceremony
She is good at playing the piano
I am looking forward to her play there
A lang-8 friend crayonmaster taught me that graduates throw their hats into the air at the graduation ceremony in States
I have seen this in the movie \"An Officer and a Gentleman
It was very impressive scene
I like the movie
By the way, come to think of it, as an interesting custom at the graduation, a girl graduate ask a boy of her love or especially her one-side love to give her the button on the uniform as a memory on the graduation day
We will have a brief meeting in this morning about the personnel transfer, maybe
Someone seems to transfer to another department
Or someone will come from another department
Certainly, it is not me at this time
My driving licence card has built-in IC chip
I can't remind them
They must be numbers of my kid's birthdays
I was very exciting when I open the envelope that the result sheet was in
Well, I could renew my personal record of the TOEIC score
My score was decreasing on the last two tests
So I studied harder to get better score
I was very proud of my effort for the test
And I think it was thanks to you all my friends here in Lang-8
Overslept again and again
I wonder if I am tired or for lack of sleep
I feel hard to get up early especially in winter
The warm bed grubs and doesn't release me
I have sore muscles here and there in my lower body, which are lower front of thighs, upper front of thighs, back of thighs, carves, soles of feet, buttocks, and lower back
Those are almost throughout my lower body
Especially I feel sore in lower front of thighs
I ask you a question
Please let me know how to express the severeness of pain in English
How do you say about pain
I will be grateful if you teach me about this
We had heavy rain in Japan, especially in Kanto Area these days
They were seriously heavy
The roads sank and the houses had water on the floors
The heavy rain suddenly starts and falls seriously heavily, we call it guerrilla rain
I went to see the movie; Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
It was long, over two and half hours, but didn't feel so long, because it was very  speedy and exciting
The images were also excellently shown as the world of the original book
I can't wait the 2nd half of the movie which will be roadshowed next summer
I went for dinner with my colleagues who will transfer to another section on April 1st
They have been my staff for just one year
I feel sorry for their transfer
I hope they will make good job at their next sections
For example, 15hour a day
So I have to go to our laboratory early in the morning to start the experimental equipments and to stay till late at night to stop them
I have to repeat them every day, including Saturday and Sunday
We will run on the 1.73km lap route around the baseball stadium and soccer studium in Hiratsuka Sougou Kouen Park
We compete how many laps we can run in 24 hours
Over 150 teams seems to participate in the relay
I was tripped and about to fall down on the way from the station to my office yesterday morning
I was walking without thinking anything then
My foot was tripped a small kink
It is hot summer and we are easy to get lack of sleep, please take care while walking, riding, driving or doing anything
Yesterday was a non overwork day of our office
Wednesday is the non overwork day
But in spite of that, I overworked a lot until 11 p.m. I worked in the empty office
I was fatigued
To tell the truth, I didn't have the non overwork days of my own since April
I overworked on every Wednesday, furthermore, even until late at night
It is because I have weekly meetings in the Thursday morning
I have to make weekly reports for the meetings in Wednesday evening
We have cold days as in winter recently, but some spring buds and flowers at the same time
We find spring has come here certainly
Lawn in my yard is turning green from yellow these days
Ceder pollen fly into the air by wind and cause our hay fever
I am also bothered with hay fever
Seriously hot marathon
I ran a marathon race yesterday
We hydrated much more than usual and paced down
We enjoyed ourselves to run very much
There is only a day away before the test
I want to get better score than the last time, at least
We place a stack of round rice cakes at every house or family to offer to the deities which come on New Years' days
The stack of rice cakes is called 'Kagami-mochi', which consists of three parts, that is a bigger round cake, a smaller one which is stacked on the bigger one, a orange which is stacked on the smaller one
The New Years's days come to end with some ceremonies including this 'Kagami-biraki' and 'Dondo-yaki', as introduced before, in Japan
She wants to go shopping to buy some books and some interior goods and to play karaoke
It will start to sign up for Tokyo marathon, which will be held next March, at 10 am today
I have run once three years ago
I have had some headache, coughs, sluggishness and heavy sleepiness these couple of days
Did I catch cold
Or did it caused by some lack of sleep or so
I went to see a doctor and got some medicines, which were cough medicine, throat medicine, and cold medicine
Labor thanksgiving day
Today, November 23th is Labor thanksgiving day
Thanks all labors
I am having a good rest day today, too
I will not go to office today, never
To tell the truth, my office is not available today, because it is now under moving
We can easily notice whether he (she) is a freshman or not, eh
I got up to go out and my son came back home right now
It is a Friday midnight
I will go to run a 112km ultra marathon today
Please give me more power and strength, both physically and mentally
I ran in a marathon race yesterday as described in yesterday's journal
That is my last race in 2009
I participated in just 30 races in 2009 
Am I a race freak, a race dependence or something like that 
I myself think I am a run freak, may be a run dependence,  to some extent
To tell the truth, I don't like race against another person very much
I like running slowly as well as jogging better with thinking various things alone and with not thinking anything
When I am running, I can have my own time for only myself
It probably means we will feel hard in the 42.195km, that means a full marathon, of course, but it is very short time compared with whole life, so it is short enough to bear it, or it is very short to enjoy it
The marathon race is the Kintarou Marathon
It will be held on next May 16th. 
We have 2km for kids, 5km, 10km and 15km race
The total of entrants are more than 2800 last year
We shared the outline of it today and checked the marathon course with walking the actual course
Total distance is about 10km
Easy pace and felt good
Today's party is easier one with my friends
They and I were also colleagues at my former office, but we are now kindred-spirit friends
Today's party is farewell party for celebrating his mandatory retirement and honoring, appreciating his long time efforts
But it will be absolutely casual, frank, and happy party
I am looking forward to seeing friends who hasn't seen me for a while at the party
I went to a party on a week ago Wednesday, didn't I
Not same \"a week ago Wed
and last Wed.?) That was one with my colleague at my present office for making better more nomi-nication I myself planned
Do you think I have a lot of parties
No, I have less than once a month on average
On the wagon\" is interesting phrase, isn't it
it means \"stop drinking\", \"no drinking\" alcohol
Anyway, I would enjoy the party this evening
I wanted to report you a good and positive story, so I could hang in there, keep running to the finish gate instead of give-up
I am very much happy to have get it done
And I am very pleased to have posted good news as well
I am bothering from bad coughs these days, I think it is more than three weeks
The clinic was full of patients and I had to wait for about one and half hour there before seeing the doctor
He checked my throat, the sound of my chest, and took the X-ray photo of my lung, and then said it was not serious and I had to take some medicines
I hope my cough leave me soon
I had planned a casual party at a Chinese restaurant to enhance the friendship among us
My coworker and I enjoyed delicious Chinese cuisine and drinks, and we enjoyed chatting about various things around us
I will plan the next event soon again
We have the reunion party of our high school today
It is the one of the annual parties for alumni in the Tokyo area held in every spring and every autumn
Our high school is in Hiroshima, which is famous for peace something, which is located about 1000km east to Tokyo
I can be able to see my friends today after a long while
Furthermore, our reunion soccer club have soccer games in the morning
I will take part in it, of course
I am looking forward to it very much, too
The soccer games in the morning, and the reunion party at night with my old friends will take me home in my youth
Should it be sounds fun
I can't help waiting
Yesterday was the day of the harvest moon in Japan, called \"Chushu no meigetsu
We have the brightest and most beautiful sight of the moon throughout a year
I jogged back home from work under the harvest moon shining very brightly and beautifully
We celebrate the growth and health of girls while displaying many beautiful Hina dolls at each family
Odairi-sama and Ohina-sama, Which are the Emperor and the Empress, and many servants are set on the five or seven tiered platform
My family used to displayed simply two Hina dolles which are the Odairi-sama  and the Ohinasama  for my daughter
Happy birthday to dad
I hope he will live long time without diseases
I'm sure spring will come here in our place soon
Early kind of sakura is now start blooming
They are 20% blooming now
We Japanese loves sakura
I also look forward to it
I am getting bored with this cold winter
I don't like spring very much only from this point of view
After the rain, it became much cooler
Fall is finally right here in Japan
We had wished fall would come soon during that very hot summer
We welcome this fall very much
Do you have any plan to enjoy this fall
My wife and son will go for a sightseeing to Nara today
I hope they can have much fun on this trip
I am wondering if I buy a pair of boots
I love it, but my feet felt the boots a little small and tight
I want bigger one
Because of the strong yen these days, I can take advantage of direct importing
Even with the shipping cost, I can get one at a lower cost from US by importing directly than in Japan
I am planing to buy a new pair of boots at the eBay shop
Siverling and almost no sweat
Maybe yes
I send an email and received the reply
I send the email to the Singapore Economic Development Board Tokyo Office
And I received the reply for it yesterday
It said we can visit the Tokyo Office and talk about the visit some institutes in Singapore
It is getting clear to visit Singapore
I feel happy for it
Losing weight
My weight was 65.4 kilograms after dinner yesterday
I think I am losing weight at a good rate
My goal is 63 kilos
By running more and dieting, I will lose weight
I think it is important to take it easy and not to rush for it
My son will take the entrance examination for the university of his first choice tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
He is not very nervous now
He looks excited positively
He has been enjoying studying kinds of subjects at his own pace
I am glad that
Am I more nervous than he
It was a half-marathon held at very hilly course nearby Mt
At the 1st half, approximately 10km straight uphills, and at the 2nd half, the 10km straight downhills knocked me out
My both legs and whole body screamed
I forced myself not to stop or walk on the way, and to keep my mind strong
I hang in there
I could get the tough race done
Anyway, I felt good for the nice weather and the nice tough course and my nice spirit
After long-awaited rain
After long-awaited rain, which was not heavy, I feel it getting more humid and colder
Spring has come on calendar in Japan, but it is still cold everyday
On the other hand, from the middle of Feb
to the middle of Mar
some snow fall here in Kanagawa and Tokyo area every year
We don't have any snow throughout winter, but we do have at the beginning of spring
I picked up some disused articles around my desk and got rid of the unwanted things
I decide to throw out some magazines, books, CDs, clothes and something like that
Some of the are going to be brought to a recycle shop
I wonder if I list some of them on the online auction
I wonder if someone want my garbage things
I left significant documents and notebooks for reference of today's job in my office
I was in a hurry at office last night because the lock-out time was very closed to me
I had to bring them back home to take them another office today
I felt like I was not standing straight on foot
I was not a dizzy, but just a strange feeling as if I got drunk or after a sleepless night
I am sure I got some summer fatigue or something like that
I think I must take care of myself and must take some good rests
To drink enough water and take salt not to get a heat stroke
Anyway, this summer will go soon
It will not be longer until it will be cooler
This is a few weeks of patience
I will relax myself during this weekend
After the long over time last nidnight
I ran back home from work around midnight yesterday, no it was already today
After long over time, I enjoyed the refresh run in the silent and dark midnight
I worked until so late to make a resume for a meeting this early morning with the president, co-president of my lab, the president and the co-president of another lab
I completed to make the resume at about twenty to midnight
But I had some snack in the afternoon, so I didn't feel hungry very much
Well, It is time to go to the meeting
I have not to make any yawns there
I will probably have no time to make a yawn
Mountains look burning
Mountains turn yellow with a lot of cedar pollen as if they were burning like a mountain fire
They are flying into the air and will attack us
The medicine for allergies makes me oversleep
They are so close
They get along very well
Which phrase is adequate
At the dinner on the night before his entrance examination, she gave him a piece of her pork cutlets
She like cutlets, so we asked her \"Are you full enough?\" She smiled and said \"This is the \"CUTLET\", eh
She wish his success in his exam, so she gave it to him
The sound of \"cutlet\" and \"Katsu\" which means \"win\" are similar, so the Japanese poor joke, \"Ton-katsu tabete uma-katta\", is very popular
That really means \"I ate pork cutlets
It was delicious.\", but also jokingly means \"A horse ate pork cutlets and won.\" \"Uma\" means horse
What nice brother and sister they are
I am happy because of my very nice and close family full of family love
I received a divers' watch won at eBay auction last evening
It is middle sized automatic one made about 20 years ago
I loved it at the first sight
It is heavier than usual quarts watches, because it is an automatic mechanical  type for heavy duty use
It doesn't need any batteries for running
It is like a Eco type, isn't it
My kids was back from their short trip
This was a story some days ago, my two children, a son and a daughter,  went on a short trip to Fukuoka in their spring holidays
They went to Haneda Airport by train and to Hakata International Airport in Fukuoka by air alone by themselves
My brother lives in Fukuoka with his family
There are two of my two nephews
The nephews also loved to meet and play with them
My children loved the castle very much and sent me its photo via email of the cell phone
But, of course, the lie must not be like something hurting other people, it must be for making them and yourself happy or fun
I think it is for us getting more smile by enjoying funny lies like jokes and enjoying our life ourselves
It is not good to tell lies everyday, so only on one day a year, April 1st, we can tell a happy lie
It seems not easy for me to tell a happy lie
I wonder I don't have a sense of humor
What funny or happy lies have you told ever before on the April Fool
In the summer, we have a lot of fireworks festivals in Japan
We Japanese love to go out for watching them in Yukatas, which are the traditional summer clothes of Japan
Yukatas are one kind of Kimonos
Women and girls go out with wearing Yukata in summer, nowadays, for example, to go summer festivals or something like that
Men and boys rarely go out in Yukata
Where we men wear the Yuaktas mostly are probably at Japanese style inns, after taking hot spring
So we can luckily enjoy watching just outside our house, we don't need to take trains or something
The only thing we are sorry about is we can't enjoy Yukatas, because neighbors and we don't wear Yukatas around our houses to watch fireworks
If you communicate with someone, you share and exchange informations with them
The mutual communication is much better than the one-way communication, I think
Mutual communications would bring us many worth things such as mutual understanding, happy feelings, smile, love, new ideas, and something better like that than one-way communication do
If you want to make a mutual communication with someone, you can start by saying hello with warm smile to them at first
At this site lang8, to write a entry, make a correction or leave a comment on it, and reply to the comment or leave back another correction on their entries is a kind of great mutual communication
I did not reply to all of your corrections and comments at lang8
I always appreciate that
Thee cold days and four warm ones
These days, a cold day follows a warm one and another warm one follows the cold one
We have a four-kanji-character-compound \"三寒四温（さんかんしおん）\", which means three cold days and four warm days
When Spring coming, It gets warmer with the cycle of three cold days followed by four warm days
Especially in this Spring, the cycle seems me to consist of a single cold day and a single warm one
I wonder what clothes to wear everyday
Even if I fall asleep, I wake up one or two hours after
My sleep seems like very shallow
Of course, I feel sleepy in daytime, especially after lunch
Do you have any good idea
2010's first working day
Today January the 5th is the first working day in 2010 of my company
I hope I would be able to do many good jobs this year
Regardless of the recent depression, no, for the reason of the depression, we should work harder and harder to make the economic recovery
OK, It's just a time to make ready for going for my job
Good luck for everyone
Are there some troubles in lang-8
I could not log in lang-8 this morning
Are there some troubles in lang-8
I got able to log in about 5 pm
Many friends of mine make kind corrections and comments on my journals every day
I can come back here luckily and hope this service will be available for a long time
I fixed by only rebooting the ADSL modem, the rooter and PCs
I am the only one in my family who can fix the trouble like that
I wonder I have to teach my family how to reboot them
We have a marathon race today
Many participants take part in it
I am one of the voluntary organizer of it
We had prepared for it for several months
We made setting the race site and course all day long yesterday
I am in charged with the race site as one of the chief staffs today
I hope we will able to organize it well and also help the participants enjoying the race very much
I signed up the Facebook, which is a SNS
However I didn't use it very much because I didn't have friends using the service
It is getting popular now in Japan due to the movie about a SNS
Several old friends of mine signed up the Facebook recently and found me, and sent me messages
A very long time passed since the last time we met actually
I think the progress of the information communication technology is amazing
My wife and I are enjoying the pot gardening
The tomatoes are species of small fruits and the bell peppers are of red and yellow fruits
In this summer, we have harvested many tomato fruits from the tomato plants
Tomato plants had grown surprisingly fast and fruited a lot of tomatoes
They are very fresh, concentrated and delicious
We enjoyed them at breakfasts almost everyday
They are also very fresh, thick and surely delicious
There was a news yesterday
We have been  studying about some Research and Development strategies since last spring
I was surprised to have found that one of the members was alumni of my high school
He was my 4 years senior alumni
I found it yesterday
It is very rare to meet my alumni here in Kanagawa, or Tokyo, which are in Kanto area, because my high school is in Hiroshima
I worked till late around midnight last night
And unfortunately, it started raining since late evening
So I had to run back home on the short route straight in the rain with umbrella around midnight
But it is not easy to run with umbrella
She wanted to do some exercises because she finished her regular exam of her high school
We went into the night neighbor for jogging
We enjoyed very much
Cool and pleasant breeze felt very good
It was one by my son
He missed the station the nearest our home of the last train because he fell to sleep in the train
He sometimes does so
His midnight call from the end of the line wakes me up and I drive a car to pick him up there
Well, it takes only 15 minutes to go to the terminal station
That was a little too much, even for me
Do you know of LSD
I ran the day before yesterday for about 4 and half hours
I don't think I ran at enough slow pace for LSD
It should be called LD without \"S
Anyway I ran
That was including the practice run of the ekiden relay race on next Sunday, my part will be a 4.8km downhill,  and visiting the temple at somewhat deep in the mountain to thank for the good results of the entrance exams of our son and daughter, on the way of the so called LSD
I have planned not to get tired too much for the 10k race next day and I planned to ran at easy pace
But I underestimated the inclines of going up and down the hills
I felt exhausted
We have soccer games today
We come together to play soccer only once a year for this activity
But we enjoy playing soccer with each other because we had graduated from same high school and had played at same play ground long time ago
I am looking forward to this event for a long time very much
I am worried about the weather, but it seems like we don't have rain today, at least before noon
It was a rather new holiday, which established in 1996
It is celebrating on the third Monday in July
This is a party of the alumni graduated from the high school in Hiroshima, held in Tokyo
It is not very near from Hiroshima to Tokyo, but many alumni are living in Tokyo metropolitan area
We have twice of the alumni party a year, which held in spring and fall annually
I am looking forward to going attend the party
But I have a work
I have to leave office early to go there
I wonder if I can, but I want to leave office early before the finish time today
There was an entrance ceremony of our son's university yesterday
It was raining and too much cold for April unfortunately
He looked like being proud
I have two troubles regarding to the internet shopping now
These are the delivery errors or something like that, I suppose
First, the replacement of a fault watch which is bought in the eBay haven't come to me yet
The replacement seems to have got lost somewhere on the globe
I contacted the seller but
And second, coffee, which is ordered to an internet coffee shop I used constantly, seems to have got lost too
What happened around me on earth
I hope them delivered soon
My shoes shrink or my feet grow
My shoes became tighter or my feet may have swelled up
My toe nails turned black and I had some blisters on the toe and the soles
I suddenly came up with an idea yesterday
That was a simple way as follows
I removed the insoles from my Mizunos to make it loosen
Don't you think it is a good idea
This was the first run without insoles
Without insoles, the shoes felt harder but not so much
My toe had some room in the shoes and felt more comfortable and less pain
Mmm, I want a new pair of shoes of bigger size
We were very glad to see his play and to hear his name on TV
His team lost after the extra time of the game unluckily, but they played very exciting game
I got a new PR on yesterday's marathon
About 4 minutes less than my old one
We could run on a very nice course and in a very good weather condition
It is written using \"kanji\", \"hiragana
I will take an endoscope examination today
So I called it a day early yesterday because I have to have dinner before 9 pm for taking the exam
I don't like an endoscope checkup
The endoscope comes into my stomach through the nose
It is even better than through the mouse
But it is still very uncomfortable for us
I picked up the phrase as \"To know is one thing, and to teach is quite another thing.\" I definitely agree that
I should know Japanese very well because I am a native Japanese
I sometimes find it very difficult to correct Japanese on lang-8er's entrries
They are learning Japanese at each levels
My friends always correct my English very well
Fulfilled week
I was fulfilled this week
First, I was busy on my job, where I have a lot of tasks to do
For example, I had some meetings with someone at first time, made a presentation to new employees concerning our section, made some important decisions regarding our research
It was because I have the TOEIC test this evening
Furthermore, I am a member of organizer for the marathon event on this weekend
We have something to prepare for it
It seems for me that time had been running faster than usual
This fulfilled week really flew by
Niigata is located on the Sea of Japan side of islands
I saw a piled snow there
It seems hard to spend here in winter with such a lot of snow
It had been not snowing in Niigata, but it snowed a lot in Tokyo yesterday evening, the super express to home was delayed by the snow
We rarely have much snow in the Tokyo area, so we are not used to much snow
Therefore such snow make somewhat effects on our life, such as the train delays, for example
The entry phone of our house rang, but no one was at the entry
We had two time of this in this week
Were they ding dong ditch
Otherwise some occult things
In the Summer time, we say we may have some spiritual things
They must not be occult or spiritual things
I believe the entry phone rang accidentally by some kinds of electromagnetic noises
Hoping world peace
On the day in 1945, one of the most historically disasters happened
Even today, some people have been still suffering from the serious aftereffects
The house which I lived in and my parents have been living in were also exposed and still leanes a little due to the blast
I hope the world peace
Let's pray for the world peace
We must do what we could do for it
And happy new year 
a little bit faster 
Have you ever heard the word \"Syu-Ha-Ri
At the beginning of studying something, we need to keep the teaching of seniors
At the next step, we break the principle and make some applications on them
It is good to learn
Next, we separate from the teaching and make your own way on the things
I keep it in my mind, and I intend to do it
The wireless LAN in my house seemed to have some troubles
I checked the preferences and the connection setups, but I couldn't fix it
I bought a new wireless receiver and set it to my PC, but the wireless LAN was still unstable, so I bought even a new wireless LAN router to set it
It became very comfortable again
I ran a race today
In the showering rain, but it was not very cold, so I enjoyed running on the wet road
Sometimes I stepped into pods, my shoes got soaked and heavier
Anyway, the rain race run was very fun
We walked through an old abandoned tunnel, where we didn't know exactly
In the tunnel, we felt something was standing behind us, but we could not turn around with fears
I think it was some spiritual thing
Cleaning up our house
Yesterday, my wife and I cleaned up our house
It is a yearly year-end cleaning, as to say \"年末大掃除
Cleaned up rooms,  removed dusts, wiped windows, vacuum cleaned,  threw some unneeded goods and books, washed  screen doors, and so on, thoroughly
No, not so thoroughly, but a little harder than usual
It was not so cold that we had fun cleaning and exhausted a little
Thanks for get-well messages
I don't have any word to say thank you
I think I can run right now, but it's raining outdoors, unfortunatelly
I don't want to run in the rain while only just recovered from the sickness
I sometimes poured water over my head to cool my body
I was fatigued but enjoyed very much
I ate too much during this winter
I gained some weight before I realized it
I ran that much, but I ate more than my body needed for running
I should have to check my weight every day
I have to lose about 3 kilograms by diet
It's crazy hot these days, even fall began on the calendar
We had better to take care not to get dehydrated and heat shocked
The air conditioner of my bedroom was out of order unfortunately, it blows only hot wind
It is 15 years old, so I ordered new one
New one will come next week
We have the X'mas party of our office tomorrow
It is held on every year-end
We have a R&D conference before the party
We will make discussions about our R&D themes with others using posters afternoon
I ran two races in a raw, a 10km race on Saturday and a 1\/2 marathon on Sunday 
This is one of the series of monthly marathons held on every second Saturday
It is because I have a half marathon next day
It is named after Sontoku Ninomiya who is one of the greatest historic people about 300 years ago contributing to agricultural revolutions in Japan
It was beautiful sunny day, So I felt great while running
But my competitive personality didn't let me keep running slowly after another runners
Less smile but serious look on my face
maybe
This was my equal private record at this marathon
I was totally exhausted by these two races for two consecutive days
I had a meeting with the director of laboratory, who is my big boss,  alone yesterday
The meeting was held before the starting of the business day
It was because he had no time during all day except that time
That was the first time we discuss alone without my immediate boss, so I was somehow nervous before the meeting
We could have very fruitful discussion about my project
I will introduce you my room where I am now studying
It is 3.5m width and 2.6m depth and has 6 tatamis as a floor
There is a low table at a corner, originally for using as the center table at a Japanese style living room, which I use for my studying desk
There are a pile of books stacking on it
There is my space
But there is not my own, not only for me
There is shared among my family, of course
Sometimes my son used my laptop there to study for his entrance exam
He will surely use his own and not use my one hereafter
His younger sister will sometimes use mine from now on for her studying
Well, anyway, I and my family use the corner of the Japanese style room for studying
I think to call it quits this time
Last episode of the TV drama
I watched the last episode of the TV drama, following the second last
I would like to say it was very fun, but unfortunately, as always, it was not as fun as expected
I think it is very difficult to make a story very interesting throughout the beginning to the end
If it is very interesting, we expect it will be interesting till the end
The more we expect, the bigger the gap between the expectation and the reality will be
Anyway, I enjoyed the drama very much
If I scratch more, I feel itchier
It seemed that I was bite by mosquitoes here and there on the body
Arms, legs, back, and so on
They feel very itchy
Even if it feels itchy, we should not scratch the spots where mosquitoes bit
They get itchier and itchier if we scratch there
Mosquitoes are increasing from now towards the late summer
It was not badly hot these days for about a week
Has the hot summer already gone away from here
It looks like good for us to reduce the electricity consumption
There may be no good influences on some leisure industries as well
to where
It was freezing cold this morning under a cold wave
The paved road surface felt harder under my shoes than usual
My hands were so chilled that I could not write nor type well
Morning glow was very beautiful because of clear air
We are now developing the new products and new enterprises from our company
We get some good experimental data and not very good data everyday
We also get some market informations from the marketing section
We do have good days with a lot of progresses and also not very good days without progresses, with some troubles instead
Anyway, we are progressing step by step, day by day, and will achieve the goal to produce new products to the market
The weather forecast said the rainy season was ended in Japan yesterday.  It is just a mid summer now
It is very shiny sunny and dizzily hot today
Please take care not to get dehydrated or not to suffer heat stroke
You had better not to exposed the sun shine and heat for very long time
Enough water and electrolytes help you from heat attack
Take good care and enjoy summer as well as possible
A big earthquake. Are you OK? 
A big earthquake stroke Japan
It was a biggest in this 150 years in Japan
And the 5th biggest in the world
10 meter height tsunami attacked the shore near the ground zero
My family and I are OK fortunately
I came back home around midnight after a long overtime last night
We ran a mara-nic, which means a MARAthon distance picNIC, yesterday
We started from Odawara , climbed Hakone, and headed to Mishima
It was very hot at the sea level, but somewhat cooler and comfortable at the high elevation level
We enjoyed this crazy tough running
There seemed something trouble with lang-8 site
Perhaps, a lot of users visit all at once, so the system might hang up
Or some maintenances are now being made
Do you know any ideas for this
In Japan, there is a word \"nomi-nication
That is a coined word made by adding \"nomi\" to \"communication
we should make more communication with others with help of some alcohol
In these days they say that we Japanese make less communications with others, especially with colleagues or business partners, than used to before
I used to go for a drink with my colleagues, often with my boss, every weekend about ten years ago
But recently, we don't
We go with close friends, but merely with colleagues or bosses
The less communications make the worse human relationship
Even the boss's frowny face may seem cute,  charming, handsome, or something like that,  as you know him more
So, I am planning a small dinner party with my working group by the end of January
It was the coldest in this winter, yesterday
And the weather forecast says it will be colder today than yesterday
The road is somewhere frozen and icy, and so slippery especially in the morning
We should take care not to slip to fall down
I wish spring is coming soon
I have just got though out from three year days of my \"Yakudoshi
The measurement way is called \"Kazoe-toshi
This time my Yakudoshi is the age of 41 to 43, form Mae-yaku to Ato-yaku
It finished the day before yesterday, my 43rd birthday
I did't experience any misfortunes or illness during my Yaku-doshi years
This is a Japanese belief that people at the ages of yakudoshi are likely to experience misfortunes or illness
Second, as a husband, I was not very good husband
I love you
Next, as a runner, I enjoyed running
I ran for more than 2000 miles of total distance this year
I should have done more exercises with balls
As a engineer, I was as usually I am
It was an ordinary year as usual
We have something good and something not good this year
Anyway, we laughed and smiled happily very many times
I have a summer vacation for a week from tomorrow
Unfortunately my wife will not have days off next week, so we can't go on a trip to somewhere very far away
We are planning to go for a day trip near here by taking the Hakone mountain railroad
We will enjoy taking the train of the switch-back style and seeing the beautiful sceneries
In the rest days, I will enjoy taking a rest while doing something for myself, for example, reading books, cleaning rooms, gardening, jogging, etc
Maybe my summer vacation will fly
Well, I wonder what I will do during it
We had a welcome party for me yesterday night
I had moved to another department in my office on April 16th
My new coworkers held the party for welcoming me
Younger coworkers are in the new department, so more cheerful the party was than my old department
Many delicious meals we had
There was a unique meal there
That is deep fried gingers
Have you ever eaten them
I ate them for the first time
It was delicious more than expected
We had a couple of very happy times at the bar while chatting casually since we had known each other with most of my new coworkers for some time
I was very happy to be welcomed and felt grateful for them
Rainy race
I have a half marathon race today
I will go near Mt
Fuji to run the race
It is raining right now here
I don't know if it will rain at race place
Well, however, I will be used to the new one soon
The highest temperature of the day is around 35 degree Celsius everyday
It is dizzylingly hot
In the city, there are the heat island phenomena
The heat wind is breezing instead of the cozy cool wind
Have you ever felt your losing of motivation after a big goal
It is weird that I don't think I can keep my motivation high after my big goal which is the completion of my first ultra marathon achieved on two weeks ago
I don't want to run after that as well as before
Perhaps I might have got a burn-out syndrome or something like that
Have you ever felt yourself like this
I have read a like story on a book by Haruki Murakami
Probably it maybe partly because of the physical fatigue, including the visceral fatigue
The instinct might force me taking a rest for recovering my whole body
Anyway, It is a very interesting experience
I enjoy it
I will take a good rest for recovering my body for some time in order to enjoy myself running again
There is just a month left till the end of this year
Time does fly actually
But they are not troubles but planned for saving electricity
We Japanese and Japan will recover soon
We spend almost normal life except for the disastrous area and blackouts and suspension of trains in the northern half of Japan
We are proud of our behaviors even in such a serious condition
We still stay strong so far and keep it up
We appreciate very much that you send Japan your support, charity, and pray
We don't have enough word to thank you
So we enjoyed the reunion party by remembering and talking about good memories in those happy days
We all got older, but our friendship will have been always green and never fade away
We had a work last Saturday, so we have a rest day today for its substitution
To tell the truth, some of the power cuts were cancelled by saving electricity consumption
I think we will have them at least in spring and summer
We have the irregular and stressful life cycle for a while to make Japan recover quickly
What we can do right now by each of ourselves is what we have to do right now for immediate recovering
Our company's president recently showed new globalization plan for employees
It was said that we should make us more global
We must study foreign languages, especially English, and get a business mind of the world competition level
It was showed that we must take the TOEIC test and score more than 600 for promotion
April's Fool
Yesterday was April's Fool Day
Anyway, I still live honest
Mentioned above is not a lie, I am sure
It is a running event of 42.195km long and easy run to see some scenery
I have one today, but it is now raining now, unfortunately
Take extra care for the road safety
On the way home I was nearly run over by a car yesterday evening
I run to work and run back home from work almost everyday
In yesterday evening, at a T-junction with a good view, not blind, I was running down straight along the road at an easy pace, A car approaching to the junction from left path ran though a stop sign at the junction intersection and nearly ran over me
I glared angrily at the female driver and went away to keep jogging as if nothing had happened
She could not see me running because she was in a hurry to go back home for preparation of dinner or something, I don't know
At dusk, we can not see very well in getting darker outside
So we must take extra care when driving, walking and running outside to keep ourselves from being in traffic accidents
I go to work by train on rainy days
It take more time than run to work on sunny days
I take two trains to my office, so I have to lose some time to change train
While running to work, I listen to music with my iPod, on the other hand, while taking trains, I read some books
I will go for it
I came back home late at night again yesterday
I have a lot of problems to solve at work which happend in line, one after another
It is sure to be a good chance to grow me up, it must be, I believe
Well I will charge myself up to get them done well
The team is belonging to a Kanagawa prefecture amateur senior soccer league
At the senior league, only the senior players of over 40 years old can play
At the annual meeting, we discussed the activities, including the game results and the budget in the last year and made the plan for the coming year, while talking about old and new staffs, way of managements, game tactics and so on
The meeting was held at a party room in an Izakaya for about an hour without drinking, it was surprising for us
It was very worthy meeting
And thereafter, we slipped into a party with alcohol
It was very fun
We drank very much and enjoyed talking about our soccer and also about something else
I wonder why athletes drink much
At least many athletes who I know of
I love electric fans in summer season very much
I don't like cool and cold air from air conditioners very much
Electric fans blow us nice breeze with more natural air
Electric fans are more comfortable than air conditioners for me
Of course I turn on one by my side right now
It is cloudy and is about to start raining
It's a rainy season in Japan
Electric fans do great job and play great roles in this season and coming summer
However, the rainy season here in Kanagawa, Japan will be end in a few days
I think it will be the next week
I love summer of course, but in this summer I am worrying about the electricity saving
Less light is rather good, but less air conditioner is not good especially for weak people, for example, the old, the baby and the sick
It's said that good fortune will be gone if you speak
I spent watching some dramas and movies recorded on the HDD recorder
I watched \"500 days of summer\" and \"Solanine\" which is one of Japanese movies, and so on
Besides, I had my hair cut after about two months from the last cut
I did not do any housework and did refresh myself by thoroughly lazy resting
I could probably completely refreshed myself now
In these days, I have been repairing the lawn in the garden
It was a kind of cooler climate lawn for autumn and winter season
I have been repairing with another kind of hotter climate lawn for summer season
It grows very faster in this hot summer
I tell you how I repair the lawn
Well, now I get it started
First, cut the straws from the summer kind lawn grass for about 5cm, and second, put them in holes picked in the garden
And then, water the straws every afternoon
Several days later, almost all the picked straw will root and grow
No need to pay more money
Why don't you try
It is a kind of fire festivals to worship traveler's guardian deities which called as 'Doso-jin
It is held here and there in rural area in Japan on the little New Year (January 15th or during14th and 16th by the lunar calendar
We burn the ”Kadomatsu”, that is decorative pine branches, \"Shimekazari\", that is sacred Shinto rope with festoons, \"Kakizome\", that is calligraphies for the New Year, and so on, at the central fire
It is said that we can avoid getting diseases if we eat rice cakes which baked in the fire, and we can improve calligraphy skill if the fire rise high
Three days off in a row
Tomorrow is the national holiday that is Coming of Age Day in Japan
So we have three days off in a row
I am enjoying the rest days just after the beginning of the new year
I can't wait it
Difficulty of timely corrections on journals
I think it is difficult to make corrections on others' journals timely
I want to make corrections and comments on journals to help studying languages to each other and to make friends with each other
Whenever I want to do so, someone have already made corrections on them
I don't think it is good to write same corrections as former's, so I am sorry but I can not make corrections adding to them
It's likely a kind of competition
It is surely difficult to make an original correction on someone's journal very timely
Have you ever feel these difficulties like me
That is based on the novel originally written by Kanae Minato
It's a revenge story of one junior high school teacher whose daughter was killed his pupils
The story mainly consists of the confessions of some characters
She, who is a teacher, a mother and became a revenger, revenges on the killers for her daughter in the very psychologically terrible way
It was a horrible story, not a happy story
No one could become happy, even the revenger mother and the revenged killers
One killer, who is a junior high school student, has his own story why he killed a little girl
And the other killer, who is a classmate of him, has another story
I don't recommend the movie to all people, especially to parents who have school kids
But It would make you think if the school life of your kids may be okay
It was only a non fiction story, but was psychologically horrible enough
I hope like this story will not happen in real world
Anyway, nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie
How do you like movies of this kind
It was an excellent weather for running marathon
Fuji which is now capped with snow, and the other mountains colored various colors of fall leaves
The 1st half of this race, I ran fun but too fast
This caused the speed down of the 2nd half
I got a stomach muscle spasm around 25km
It was a little serious for running
The toughest one in a year, I think it was
What are you planning to do in this weekend
I will run a half marathon in the Fuji International Speedway on Sunday
I will run 4 and half laps at the entire course on the speedway
But much slower than a racing car needless to say
Congrats Spain
Spain beated Netherlands 1-0 in extra time
It was very exciting game filled with many amazing plays of global level
I am looking for the next one even the current one has only just finished
I make it a rule to do some routines in the new year's holidays
On the first day, I run to the top of a mountain nearby to see the first sunrise with friends
Then, I walk up to the temple to wish a nice year with family
On the second day, we visit my wife's parents for New Year's greeting
And we go to cheer the Hakone Ekiden Relay Race
And we go to watch the High School Soccer Championship games at the stadium
And then, we go shopping at Yokohama midtown
On the third day, I run to cheer the Hakone Race again alone
I spend somewhat busy holidays
Note everything down on notebooks
We always think of many things of various kinds
Coming up with good ideas, having a brainstorm alone, thinking of a right words or phrases, and so on
And, it's a pity that we can not keep all of them in our mind or we can not remember what good ideas we think up a just while ago
We would forget most things because our brains don't have infinite capacities
Yes, probably it is for us, at least for me certainly
Don't you think it is good if we could remember every good ideas we had thought of
What should we do for that
What we should do for that is to note everything down on notebooks
Bringing notebook with us anytime anywhere, we note down anything you see, hear, feel, and good ideas, even not good ideas, everything
Fortunately, notebooks are not so expensive, easy to get at stationary shops, convenience stores, and so on
And they have infinite capacities if we want
When we fill up a notebook, we can just use the next new one
We can write everything on them and then we can forget everything we had note down
That is a good idea, don't you think so
It is not easy to keep high concentration during the long time
Half marathon race
I am going to run in a marathon race today
This is \"Fuji Marathon Festa
There are some races in the \"Festa
I participate with a half marathon race
I will enjoy it 
I'm not ready for going out yet
I have to prepare now
I will report you about the race later
It was nominated for the Oscar
Aliens had come to the earth and their spaceship had been staying in the air above Johannesberg
The aliens was caught and isolated into District 9 by men
Someday, it was planned that they were forcibly moved from District 9 to another district
The chief person in charge of the alien transfer is a man who is not a soldier, but only a minor officer
He began his work to transfer the aliens from District 9 to another district
And then something trouble happened to him
The rest is omitted for not to reveal whole story
I enjoyed seeing it
It was interesting for me
But I don't recommend all of you to go see it
It is not just a happy movie or not for young children because some cruel expressions are in it
It is full of a variety of features; aliens, actions, splatter, robots, friendships, and so on
But unless you like these genres of movies, I don't recommend you to see it
Now open the sweetfish season
They come all the way from a distance early in the morning
The river is famous for sweetfish fishing
They fish by decoy in the center of the river at waist level of water with very long fishing rods
They are lead to invade the turf of some other sweetfish of target and the invaded one attack the decoy to be hooked
That is the way of fishing sweetfish by decoy as well as I know
I have never fished sweetfish by decoy
Many fishers and very long rods in the river is a beautiful scenery in summer
Along the usual riverside course, I did an early morning run before leaving for a business trip
After the rain, the road was getting dry and felt a little humid but comfortable
Today, I will attend the lecture for getting the licence of the fire prevention supervisor
I will be the supervisor
At first, I began running for losing my weight
I think it's for something like a self-development
And I could manage to complete it
I got a sense of completion
I could get a huge sense of completion
But at the same time, it was weird but I felt some sense of lack
From 70s seniors to 19 years old new graduate came there
We all seemed like we had been in high school days
It was Saturday yesterday
Sunday is usually a holiday for my company
But I had  to go to my office to do some urgent job
I decided to run to holiday work
I made some detour along the river and somewhere for about one and a half hour
I ran back home in the midday
One of my daily workout is a strength training
I do this mainly to strengthen my body muscles but also to wake me up in the morning
I don' do this too hard
and use no extra weights as dumbbells
Pushups on th toes for 30 repeats
How do you think about my training menu 
Mine is rather half empty
I think time flies fast
I want more time to do more things I have to do
Have a good time on your 2nd half
The other semi final game of the World Cup soccer is now being played by German and Spain
Now I am writing this post during the half time
Spain team overwhelmed German team in the 1st half
Speedy short passes were made and fantastically organized team play made by Spain team
Well, now the 2nd half was whistled
Do you think the blue sweater of the coach will work for German team again
I found one shooting star this morning
To believe yourself
To believe your capability
To believe you can get though the difficulty
To believe you love people around you
I get up early to study everyday
I always get up at four on the weekdays and at five on the weekend
For being like that early bird, I have to go to bed early at night to have good sleeps
But unfortunately, I have been very busy at my work these days
I come back home from work around eleven in the night
I can sleep only no more than five hours a day these days
This is why I am still very sleepy right now
Well, anyway, I have to prepare for a presentation in the meeting next Tuesday
Whenever at a time like this, some troubles happen to us
We must pull together to go through this difficult situation
OK, all right, I woke up right now
I' ll do my best today
Excursion with my son
My son and I took the same train to commute yesterday morning
I went to the head office of my company in central Tokyo for business meeting
I took the train which my son took to his university
There was no seat for two of us, but only room for one
The train was getting crowded more and more  as it went to central Tokyo
After that, he got off and changed at Shimokitazawa Station to his train to school
I also changed at the next station to my head office
It was only one of daily scenes
They were set in splints not to fall down by the wind or anything
I am looking forward it growing up, getting blooming and fruiting
The zero point was close to the 311's one
Here also quaked about intensity 3
I don't know of the damages caused of it
Now we are in the rainy season in Japan on calendar
However, we had no rain after that
Someone are glad to have less rain, but others are not glad
I am afraid if water shortage may be serious in this summer
Especially we will have to save electricity in this summer
Less electricity, less water, and heat in summer will attack us
The day of the beginning of autumn
Yesterday was the day of the beginning of autumn on calendar
The breeze in the early morning and the evening feels cooler little by little, day by day, even it is still very hot in the midday
We can sleep better in the night than a week ago
I feel a little  sad summer is going
We have a game of the local league
We are sure to be incredible enthusiast of running
It is rather cool in this morning
Do you have any plan
I will go for a two-day trip to Kyoto with my family in the first week on August
I wonder how long it has been since the last our family trip
After two days interval, that was unexpected but good rest, I enjoyed this commute run
We can't expect better weather
But the pollen are now attacking me on my nose
The next, I ran at lunchtime
I was sorry I ran with my itchy and runny nose, but excellent warm spring daytime
I didn't want to go back to office
And the third, I ran a long detour from work
Yesterday was the no overtime day of my office
So I left my office out as soon as possible to run to see cherry blossoms in the dusk
We spend a long time very happily together
I can hardly say directly to her I love her, but I do love her
Some years ago, she completely forgot the day was a day of our anniversary
I love her something like that, too
I found two big male Japanese pheasants at the riverbank path on the way to work yesterday
It seemed about two feet from head to tail
They have beautiful read heads and long tails
There are many kinds of wild birds around the river which bank I run as a home course
Some kinds of herons, geese, and so on, I don't know their names
I am glad to watch them while running
A short of sleep plus some alcohol makes an oversleep, as you know
This was my first time in this year
They are sign of the early summer in Japan
They can live in clean water, so we have not to pollute rivers to preserve them
Anyway, another topics, I got some spam friend invitations these days
Did you
On the next weekend, I will run a 24 hour relay race
The first run to my recently moved office
I commuted by running to and from the new located office yesterday
It was the first run to there
It is a little shorter than ever
It should have been
The former one included a nice riverside cycling road, but the new one consists mainly of streets and sidewalks by them
The streets have a lot of cars during the morning commute time, and the sidewalks are too narrow to enjoy running
I also enjoyed seasonal sceneries on the former riverside cycling road, but I can't enjoy them on the new route
It is not so enjoyable
Especially in the fresh morning
Or I will be used to it
So I should search for better routes asap
I think it will be fun to explore better routes as well
Congrats on advance to the final
Japan players played quickly and toughly throughout the whole game
Their body  shapes are smaller than Sweden players, but they are never inferior in physical properties
And the shots were highly accurate
It seemed there were no place to step in his room before yesterday
He finally made his mind to clean his room
There is almost nothing remained on the floor
Where did they go
There are not so many dust bags
It seem like the messy goods went into the closet, drawers or shelves, probably
I ask myself how was this holiday
And I reply it was very good, of course
I could complete my first 112km ultra marathon, went cycling with my wife, spent much time with my family, read some novels, did some houseworks, and refreshed myself well
The busy days will be back to me
I will fly to Singapore tomorrow for the business trip
Therefore I hear a good news, I am lucky the typhoon will have gone tomorrow
It speeds up faster than forecasted
So The flight for my Singapore trip will be able to fly as usual tomorrow
I hope so
I have a secret that I still have some hangover right now
At last, The replacement watch arrived to me on Feb.1st
I sent a fault watch to replace on last December
It was 3months ago! 
I sent emails of inquiry to him every week, he replied me he had already shipped the replacement on each of his email, but it had not come to me
But, actually, the date of exportation written down on the delivery record sheet is
I forgive him, because the watch is here on my list now
Fuji is now capped with snow as like shown in my profile photo
I feel the winter is here by seeing it
I begin the morning banana diet from yesterday to lose weight
I want to lose about 3kg of weight until the Arakawa Marathon on March 21th
Just be sure to get enough calories in to stay healthy - if you skimp too much, you blast your immune system and leave yourself open to illness
Good foods make you good healthy
Another working late
I came back home from work around past midnight for the last three straight days
I will have to go to work on this weekend
July comes
The first half of this year has gone
The second half started right now
Which do you think, half full or half empty
To Whom it May Concern in Singapore Economic Development Board

We are now learning about open inovation in Europe, US and Asia compared Japan

ZZZZZ Interbusiness Research Institute website is below
Respectfully yours
I got a mail from my friend yesterday
She said her daughter is getting married next March in the mail
It was a very good news and pleased me
I thought it was coincident that the two marriage will take place around us
By the way, my brother doesn't marry my friend's daughter
Suspicious no-goal
That happened yesterday at the game between Germany and England
The ball shot by a attacking player hit the crossbar and bounced into the goal once and bounced back outside to the goal keeper
However, the referee didn't recognize the goal by mistake
Referees of the world level seldom make a mistake, but not never unfortunately
That's why many things are interesting and exciting
At the same card in 1966, that was interesting, German verses England, on the contrary, the referee misjudged the goal for actual no goal
This has been called \"Suspicious goal
The play with no goal at yesterday's game will be called \"Suspicious no-goal\", from now on,  I think
One of my friends is now trying to run 100 marathons on every single day during 100 days
We, his friends, are supporting for his great challenge
We organize marathon races everyday for 100 days
He ran the 85th marathon yesterday
Very exciting plays were seen during the 1st half of the match
These were very speedy and powerful
The splendid goals were shot scored by Netherlands
and Uruguay respectively
Soon the 2nd half is to be kicked off
Remarks of masters of marathon
Please refer to my journal for information of the mara-nic;  
it was tough, but very enjoyable
The members of the Club are running marathons more than 100times
Don't you think it is awesome
They said they are running marathons every weekend
They are masters of marathon, aren't they
Some of the masters said to me yesterday, \"You feel it tough to run marathon if you run once in a while, but you could get used to it if you run do it every week.\" Other master agreed and said, \"Yes, sure
You could get used to it, as well as we all got used to it
Mistook
I got a mail
The mail said the item I sold on internet auctions was not correct
I said it was made by a  maker, but it was made by another maker
I made a mistake
I proposed him to return and refund
I feel some stress these days
I have to refresh myself by doing something
Do you have any good ideas for refreshing
At first, I will enjoy this weekend
Playing badminton in the gym in the hot summer seemed very tough and probably gave the players, including my daughter, some physical and perhaps mental damages, as called a summer fatigue
We are worrying her
We started at the Japan National Stadium, ran about the city of Shinjuku and ran back to the stadium to finish
It was very fun and exciting
Some masquerade runners ran
Pikachu, Gatcaman, which are anime characters, a zebra, a swan, a businessman, a schoolgirl, and so on
They were so fanny
The marathon race was exciting
I had a marathon race yesterday
I had mistook to set an alarm or quit the alarm by mistake unconsciously last night
So I had to rush to the starting site
Without any magic supplements, any nutritions nor warming up and stretching before the start, I started running the race
In the beginning, I ran at even slower pace, and gradually sped up to even easy chattable pace
Comfortable and beautiful Fall day, I felt very good
After around 35km, both sides of outer hips felt sore and body felt heavier
I managed to keep the pace to the last
And in the last about 1km, I escorted a visually impaired runner
It was my first time as a escort runner
We have a trouble with the wireless LAN at our home
We can't print documents with one PC via the wireless LAN on the printer which is connected wirelessly
With another PC or Mac, we can print documents correctly
So only the certain PC has a problem
I am an administrator of the home network, I have to fix the problem
The problem may be at the network setting of the printer or the PC
I am sure to be able to fix it
It was one of the newest smart phones
It has many features like PCs
And the applications can be get through the internet
It is not only a cell phone but a small mobile PC
I am using an old type cell phone
I got back home from the reception for the Challenge Fuji 5 Lakes Ultra Marathon tomorrow
I got my number tags #1570
I will have short sleep and drive there by 3 am
I am too exited to get to sleep
It is held at Shonan area in Kanagawa, Japan
About 20 thousands runners participate it
Done it, too
And third, to run a 100 times distance of 42.195 km during this year
Thank you very much for your encouragements
I am very sorry to complain this time
I am not a kind of complainers
Just this time
By the way, It is about my working environment
I don't like it very much, even say I can't almost put up with it
There are much unpleasant noise and smell from my coworkers
My left neighbor makes loud noise of chewing gums every time
One on my right are constantly murmuring, saying to himself
One on my behind makes loud noise of his broken computer fan that is rotating at the maximum speed all the time
And the one next to the behind wears a lot of perfume
it's not so bad smell but too much enough for me to dislike it
They prevent me from concentrating on my deskwork at my desk
I work on my computer set on my desk, so I can't escape from my desk to another place, for example, to a library or a meeting room
I put earplugs into my ears all the day to concentrate on my work
I wonder what I can do for that working environment
I am making a plan to change it there or escape from there
How are you going in this summer
This is another hot and humid morning here
But it's Sunday
What is your plan for today
There are some representative office of foreign institutes, such as scientific technology research centers
I have chances to visit some of them in this summer
The day before yesterday, we visited to the representation office of that from Finland
And today, we will visit to the office from Germany
We are studying about R&D and business strategies, so we visit to hear about their strategies of the institutes abroad
We could hear very interesting talk the day before yesterday from Finland
We look forward to visiting Germany in Japan today
We can rarely get chances to go such places
They seem something like travel abroad in Japan
10 days already passed since December had started
I was sure to make a lot of things done
For example, The 100 straight day running, the 100km ultramarathon, the 24 hour relay, the transfer at work, the work as a R&D theme leader, and so on
Entrances into the university of my son and into the high school of my daughter
Many many things I had in this year
Well, we Japanese enjoy year-end party
I have several parties
I had one of our department yesterday, and have one with my friends today, and one with other members tomorrow
Well, It is the second half of November
We have only about forty days by the end of this year
What are your top ten news
Yesterday was the Father's Day
Did you call your father if you are living apart from him
Did you say thanks to him
My daughter bought me a chou a la creme with her gratitude
My son showed me his appreciation by saying thanks to me
I also made a phone call to say thank you to my dad
My parents are living in Hiroshima alone
He seems very fine
He said he was glad to be called
I wish his health
I sell some unwanted things on the internet auctions
It seems that they are worthy for the other
Most of them are sold and priced more than expected luckily
I am busy to ship them
I will buy something on the internet auctions with the profits
I will tell you about a small happening around me
We are representative of several companies and  gather to discuss business issues approximately once a month since this spring in this fiscal year
After the meeting, we had a dinner and a had  frank talk for making friends with each other
When one of the member and I talked about our home town, something surprising was made clear
His wife and her sister was the alumnus of my high school and the sister might have been my same year in school
It was surprising happening
We are now 1000km far from our home town
And he and I had met only five times or so
I felt the world might be rather small
In Japan, the lunar eclipse can be observed in the west sky right now
it is eclipsed partially in the lower left part
There is no cloud around the moon luckily, we can see the eclipse very clearly
Happy new year, all
I gonna go out for jogging up to summit of Mt
After the long overnight work
I could have two times of one hour catnaps on the chair
I feel kind of headache or dizzy
What does it mean
We don't have like such words in Japanese
It sounds like a nice word
Can I have the information whether you have any topics about the issue or not in advance of the next meeting
Do you know of the \"White Day
Have you heard it
On Valentine's Day, females give chocolates to males as a symbol of there  love or appreciation
And I think it is weird that turned to be obligation these days
Honmei-choco\" means chocolate of love
Giri-choco\" means obligation chocolates
On the \"White Day\", males who luckily received chocolates return their favor by giving gifts, sweets like cookies, candies, etc
even if he received \"Honmei-choco\" or \"Giri-choco
I'm not sure, but there wasn't the White Day in my childhood
We Japanese love interesting events or ceremonies like this, so the White Day got popular immediately
Me
I have received many chocolates from many females, of course, rrom my wife, daughter, many female friends, coworkers
I have to give them very much delicious sweets with my love
Since Vatentine's Day was on Sunday and due to recent slow economy, females doesn't buy less obligation chocolates
By the way, today March 14th is my 43th birthday
My office moved to the other place recently
It is a little farer from my house than former one
There is a longer distance, it is about 4km, than the former one, it was about 2.6km
I am wondering how to commute everyday
When it is fine, I run to office as before, that's still good
Otherwise when it is not fine, the heavy rain or snow for example, which is better to take a train or to walk to the office
Both of them take almost same time
I must apply for the commute pass, so I must decide how to commute soon
One day business trip
I went for a business trip to Shiga
I took the super express Hikari at Odawara, changed to Nozomi at Nagoya, changed to a normal train at Kyoto, and at last, arrived at Katata in Shiga nearby Biwa Lake, which is the largest lake in Japan
It was rather shorter than expected
I had a business meeting there, at Katata
It's a nice meeting and we had a nice discussion, but for only two hours
After the meeting, I came back by regression on the above mentioned route
It was a long distanced one day business trip
This year October 11th is it
We have many sports festivals and What are you planning on the three day weekend
It will be nice to go outdoors in the comfortable weather in fall
I am going to go running about Tokyo, while stopping at some sightseeing famous spots there on Sunday
But unfortunately, I am sorry the weather forecast says it may rain
The extremely long distance race is very exciting,don't you think so
I have been conducting training for it
At this week I have been tapering down my training for recovering and conditioning of my whole body
I have to remove fatigues from myself
The slower pace and shorter distance run I should do
Of course, if necessary, I have to take a good rest
Well, so, for example, during lunchtime yesterday, I intended to run slowly at easy recovery pace
I ran even more slowly than my usual easy pace for my lunchtime run
I'm really sure I had better to run more slowly for recovery and tapering, but I was so hungry that I automatically pace up to rush into cafeteria
I began to prepare outfits and the other stuffs for it
I am wondering which outfits I should wear
It will be much colder there early in the morning than here in my place, but it will be as warm in the daytime as here, and it will be getting colder in the evening again
It is very exciting anyway
I mowed the lawn and grass, cut some branches of trees
Besides, I went to sell some clothes and books to a recycle shop 
I live around less than 100km apart from it, so I can see it almost everyday
It makes me cheer up everyday every time
But, there was a bad news
Ukyo Katayama, who was former a F1 driver and now an alpinist, and  his party met with an accident during their attack to climb to Mt
Fuji yesterday
Ukyo was rescued and could return alive luckily, but two men of his party hadn't come back yet
They climbed to snowed Mt
Fuji to training for climbing to mountains in the Antarctica
I hope they could come back alive
I am sorry that the camp is not a kind of the interesting outdoor activities
We are studying about the strategies of Japanese companies and public research institutes compared with foreign ones, with some members from some companies
We visited Singapore to study Singapore's two weeks ago
Today and tomorrow we will stay one-stay-two-day at a suburban convention center to discuss our proposal
I am a leader of one work group among three of all
It is like a significant task as well as my own work at my company
I received the sash from my former runner in maybe about 35th position
and I took over about 10 runners, I'm not sure
So we could get the 25th place among over 240 teams
However, unfortunately, It was cloudy yesterday so we couldn't enjoy the beautiful perspectives while running
I was not in very good physical condition from recent busy work day, at least not in peak condition for challenging for my private record
Ttherefore I had decided to run at my fun-run pace
Actually at the race, I ran a bit faster than the fun-run pace, because my physical and also mental condition got better and better while running
This is just the FUN-RUN for refreshing ourselves
Appropriate physical exercise at nice duration and nice load could refresh ourselves, I believe
Anyway, I could enjoy the fun-run race yesterday
I received the results of the annual health check that was taken in June
Spring comes here
Daytime is getting longer and longer, then morning is lighter
I walked on high, narrow bridge without railing in the dream
I don't like high place very much
I feel scared at high place
I had to go through the bridge, but it disappeared suddenly just before I stepped on it
Do you know any ideas
There are some good ideas to think of your posts
What could not you continue instead
I have an overnight work again
I had one on Tuesday, and have another today
It is because we are now conducting a long experiment in my lab, so we take care of it by rotation
Especially, in this heat summer season, it feels much tougher
But, anyway, today is Friday, tomorrow is Saturday
I will have a good rest tomorrow
When I can leave office early, I should do so
Taking a good rest will refresh myself
I came back home late at night again and again yesterday
I have a lot of problems to solve at work which happened in line, one after another everyday
They are newly found technical problems, accidents around personals, disorders of facilities, and any kinds of problems which annoy us to conduct our researches
I am sure this is a good chance to grow me up, it must be, I believe
Well I will charge myself up to get them done well
I hope all of you have good luck on your whole life
We have a welcome and farewell party last night
I enjoyed myself till late
She wants to do practice for the running test in her physical education class next week
Well, yes, women want to be fit at all age, I know
I went on a trip to Kyoto during this summer holidays with my family
I stayed for two days in Kyoto
So I could see many temples and shrines, but it was a little busy
I will go Kyoto in the autumn again more slowly
We are planning to visit Singapore from Sunday on business
But, unfortunately, a typhoon is there on the East China Ocean, where is on the way from Japan to Singapore
On Sunday, it will approach to Japan
Besides, a volcano erupted in Indonesia and is still erupting volcano clay
It is another difficulty for us to go to Singapore
I wonder if our flight can go well
Mine is following
My boy entered the university
My girl entered the high school
I ran on every single 100 days
I could complete my first 100km ultra marathon
I ran more than 4219.5km of the total distance in a year
I joined in the running club
I visited to Singapore
Our office moved to the former place
Other many good stuffs happened around me, not mentioned above
I am making the report to the president of our company about the visit to Singapore
My boss has checked my draft, already for several times
His comment is correct, but I think it will take a very long time to get the report finished
Good news
I have a good news to share
There was the announcement of the result yesterday
He got it
We are very glad to hear the good news
Thank you all lang-8 friends for encouragements to him
And sorry for making you worry for him
I hope he will have nice days at the university
He says he wants to study physics there
He will also learn another various things there
Anyway, It seems to me that children grow up very fast, especially our own children do
I dislike spam mails like that
Fell down to sleep well
It was a tough camp with concentrated discussions all day long till midnight and since early in the morning
I came home around five
I felt tired and free at least at that time
I watched one of recorded TV drama before dinner, read some pages of a novel after dinner, and fell sleep unconsciously
I woke up once and went to bed to have deeper sleep
I got up right now, it is early morning
I live near a station of Odakyu Line Railways
We have the sounds of railroad crossing more than every five minutes
We are completely get used to them
Today December 23th is a Japan's national holiday
Yesterday was the winter solstice, tomorrow is the Christmas eve, and the day after tomorrow is the Christmas
We feel busy in December
We Japanese take a bath with \"Yuzu\", which is a kind of Japanese oranges, on  the winter solstice day
Because we believe the habit keeps us from getting a cold
The day will be longer little by little from yesterday
I hope spring come soon
I took a seminar about leading groups
The thought leads us to do anything well
Positive thought leads us  to succeed, while negative thought leads us to fail
I use the morning time to study
I make a habit to study early in the morning
I continue this habit for more than two years
I'm sure it is because the rhythm of life sometimes shifts by overstays, stresses or something like that
From another point of view, the oversleep may be good for some rest
I will take it a little easier, not strict
Have you ever heard \"Mara-nic
It is made of these two words, \"marathon\" and \"picnic
It means, as you suppose, a picnic of 42.195km marathon distance run
Even slower than normal jog, 7-8min a kilometer or more, I'm not sure
We each take a backpack or a waist bag to carry a bottled water, a camera, a towel, some chocolates, candies, energy gels, and so on, as same as regular picnics
Have you ever heard Enoshima
It is very popular because it is a symbol of Shonan area
There are beautiful sea, beautiful beach, and rows of pine trees
The famous pop group Southern All Stars sings Enoshima and Shonan area, some famous movies were taken there also
Found spring in garden
We have cold days here in these days
The winter seems like to come back
But I can see some signs of the spring coming to our place
The lawn grass woke up and began to grow again
The weeds also began to grow as fast as the lawn grass
The push mower must be ready to work
I was glad to have found the spring signs
Spring is coming here
I am a liaison at our senior soccer club
I send mails to the members about game schedules and game participants and any other informations
I ask their presence or absence some days before every game and let them know the summary
It is more bothering job than expected
So I planned to make the correspondences easy by utilize a mailing list online
Do you know of  a mailing list online
We can email all members at once via the mailing list easily
It seems very useful for me as a liaison
One problem is that it is very difficult for me to persuade senior friends to sign up for the mailing lists
By now, about two thirds of members joined our mailing list yet
I want to and have to let all members join our mailing list as soon as I can
I will introduce some phrases to ease you and me who are suffering from many everyday's stresses
I read them in some books in these days
Don't be egoistic
Don't think you have to be always at the first place
Consider something at your partner's point of view and his values
Answer or response after one breathing
Don't self-defense excessively
Forgive yourself as well as other people
Set you up easily
How do you think they are
Outbid at eBay
I sometimes enjoy the eBay auction
Sometimes I bid on some items, but I rarely win them
It is because my bids are not high , so they are always outbid
So far, I won some old cameras and some old wrist watches at eBay with very reasonable prices respectively
I was lucky then
Browsing at eBay is very interesting, don't you think so
Today, we will have a power cut in the afternoon
We have long holidays called Golden Week in Japan
If added some paid holiday, we have long holidays from today to next next Monday
This is as long as summer holidays or new year's one
What shall I do in this holidays
Some runs, riding bikes, spending with family, and taking rests for relaxing
Have good holidays everyone especially in the northern Japan
I hope it from the bottom of my heart
The import tax of leather shoes is very expensive in Japan
It said that $35 for the item, $40 for the shipping, and $50 for the import tax and something, approximately
Don't you think the import tax is too expensive
The import tax of leather shoes is the higher one between $50 or 30% of the price of item including the shipping
This make me think it is better to buy shoes at $100 in Japan than to buy at the reasonable price like this on eBay
A new week starts
This is Monday
I wonder what should I do until the end of the year
We have something to do in this year, don't we
Cleaning house, writing new year cards, and some houseworks like that
How were you going in this year
My watch seemed broken when it was dropped on the floor
I will repair it by myself if I can do
We are very lucky without any rain yesterday
About 36 thousands runner ran around the central Tokyo
The excellent course, organizing, volunteering and warm cheering
We will run 40 laps on the track in the National Stadium and donate 100 yen every lap for giving safe water
I signed up as a team consisting of four runners of my family :  my wife, my son, my daughter and me
I love running, but I wonder how they do
We had an annual relay race yesterday
It was one of the attractions in our company
The race is held just after the quitting time of our office
But unfortunately, some serious troubles happened over my work in these days
They were all serious and urgent problems
I had to deal with them immediately
It was needed to have done so
I thought I should not waste time by running the race, but should dig in my work
I was disappointed that I couldn't run the race and I let my team withdraw from it
It was a very nice race which has a history
Yesterday's was the 45th
It has a very good course with nice scenery, nice warm audiences and excellent staffs
We fell autumn breeze these days
The hot summer is going
It is still very hot in the daytime, but cooler in the morning and the evening than before
Autumn is coming here soon
Go shopping with my son and wife
My wife and son and I went shopping last Sunday
A shop clerk said us that he envied us for our closeness
Yes, we are very close, I think
We love to go shopping together and enjoyed ourselves sometime
The 18 year old boy goes shopping with his dad and mom
What do you think about it
When I was 18, I lived by myself in Tokyo apart from my parents
That is not why but I rarely go shopping with my parents
I didn't spent much time with them those days
I wish I had done so more
If then, my parents would have probably felt more happy, eh
Anyhow, my family, including my 15 year old daughter, are very close and happy
We have to be nice to parents and family
This \"mara-nic\" is made with marathon and picnic
It was 42.195km distance of picnic
It is mid-summer now, it was very very hot yesterday
We could not run but walk due to the heat
I woke up on the sofa right now
I spent all night on the sofa in the living room instead of on the bed
It is not good habitation
I have to go to bed in the night
I have many things to do before the holidays
I hang on there and will climb Mt
I also have a business trip during the holidays, as same as previous one
He is a 18 year old freshman and she is a 15 year old high school student
I have not seen them arguing or fighting for many years
It is usually my role to help her study at home, but yesterday it was he who did so, substituted me
He taught her math, and on the contrary of that, she helped him practice to teach as a part-time cram school teacher
The Frostbite Road Race was held yesterday in the Yokota Air Base in Kanagawa, Japan
It is the 29th annual race
It is hosted by the Yokota Striders Running Club
We run the races in the base of the US Air Force, on the road around the runways and nearby the residence in it
I run the half marathon race
It was sunny and of mild wind so it was not too cold as last year's
Many American family members in the base cheered us very friendly, while shouting, yelling most in Japanese, \"Ganbare!\", \"Ganbatte!\" I feel happy to hear them cheering us
I could renew my record
It is a little faster than that got there in last year
BTW, what do you say \"Ganbare!\" in English
Good job!\", \"Nice running\", \"Go on!\", ..., they said more but I am sorry I can't remind it any more
It takes not more than 2 hours total to go office
It will be tough, but easier than taking apart from my family
Last week of July
After this week, we will have summer holidays
I am planning what to do on the holidays
I want to climb Mt
Fuji after long while
The last time I climbed was 20 years ago
I will also go to Kyoto with my family
This holidays will be nice
A lot of overtime hours and holiday works is necessary to get my tasks done
I have been working from early morning to around midnight at office and sometimes go business trips
I feel like exhausted and somewhat irritated
I know it is not good for myself and my surroundings
I need some rest for refreshing myself
Ugh, It is time to leave for office to do holiday works on Saturday
Can I ask you to pray for me to keep my mental and physical condition
I do think it's getting difficult for me because of lack of news or essays
They say like this..., 
The slow and steady wins the race
Do it for just only 30 minutes, but do it everyday
If you do it for ten thousands hours in total, you could be an expert of anything
I am facing now a trouble or something concerning about an internet shopping from overseas
I bought a vintage diver watch from an eBay seller in overseas last October
The watch is made around 1980
it is so massive and cool that I love it very much at a first sight
I emailed the seller to replace it or repair it in my English with difficulty
But now, on the beginning of January, I didn't receive the replacement yet
I sent some emails to let me know informations
By the way, I am enjoying this transaction because this is a good chance to study English communication at a special situation
My parents live in Hiroshima where is about 1000 km apart from here, so we can't meet so often
My son will live alone since next summer
I will know my father's feelings when I live apart from my son
My son failed to take the last train after drinking last night and could not come back home
So he is staying in some town right now
Maybe he is staying at a overnight cafe there
It is sure he feels cold
He will be back home by taking the first train soon
I overslept this morning again
It is probably because I am rack of sleep these days
Besides, I love the comfortably warm bed more in cold winter
I came back home around midnight after a long overtime last night
There are many things to do before summer holidays, as you know
Therefore I had better go to bed last night, I knew it, of course, but I didn't want to do so and I woke up late last night
I still feel sleepy now
We measured our height, weight, and body fat rate
We were taken  kinds of test, such as blood test, urine test, chest X-ray, eyesight, hearing ability, ECG, ultrasonic echo, and so on
We must not have eaten and drunk anything, even water, till 9 pm of the day before the check
We got very hungry by its end
I unintentionally welled up tears in my eyes while drinking that sweet coke after the check
New week started
Another new week started
It's been still raining for straight three days
I don't like this rainy season before summer in Japan
It is humid and cold some day and hot the other days
We have to take of ourselves not to catch a cold
By the way, I have to make three reports today
Each one of them is very heavy for me
I am going to make my best efforts for them
Well, anyway, this time, I will introduce you a nice event last night
I ran to work and back home for about 5 kilometers through the residential area and the paddy field and by the river
Ajisai, which is the Japanese name of hydrangea, flowers begin to bloom with colors on the sidewalk
Water is filled in the paddy fields and people were planting rice plants there
It is also a nice scenery
I love it
Furthermore, last night, I found a firefly flying by the river path where I was running
I felt as if it followed me for a while
It was very romantic, wasn't it
It was a rendez-vous or something like that
Ajisai and firefly are symbol of this season
They are only seen in the rainy season in Japan,  and seen only in rural areas
Hurray, how nice living in a rural area
I have a big good news
The results of the drawing for the tickets for Tokyo Marathon 2011 was announced yesterday
It is very lucky that I won the ticket by lot
More than a million people applied for 30000 lucky runners
It is very real platinum ticket
I couldn't win it last year
I am looking forward to running Tokyo Marathon
Why do we easily hurt someone whom we love the most on the earth
We don't want to on purpose, of course, but do hurt by mistake again and again
We feel sorry, unhappy, unpleasant, regretful whenever we hurt them, and we always decide not to do it again
But it is not easy for us not to do it again
 no, why do I myself 
We love Sakura, cherry blossoms
It blooms in Spring for only about one week or so
When blooming, the cherry trees doesn't have their leaves, but only many little flowers with cute white pink five petals
We enjoy seeing sakura, Hanami
The Washington's cherry trees are popular, aren't they
After full blooming, cherry blossom petals will fall in the wind
In a moderate wind, they fly into the air one after one lightly (fleetingly?), I think it is a scene of Japanese Wabi-Sabi
In a strong wind, the many petals falls simultaneously
Thousands or millions of petals fly into the air all together
It is so gorgeous that you would forget to breath
I could not have enough time to post a journal to Lang-8
It was very much hot yesterday
It was record hot in June
Many people were attacked by the heat
We should take care not to get dehydrated in this season
The quake felt like keep shaking for more than minutes
The floor swayed side by side
We felt feared
Its ground zero was northern Shizuoka, where is under Mt
It's very near from here
Fortunately, I had already come home and was with family, and we all were safe
We have to take care of aftershocks
We have a relay race in our factory cite after work tomorrow
It is the 61th annual one
Four runners run at every team for about two to three kilometers respectively
Many people seem to have been looking forward to the race as every year
Anyway, I think that I love running and others also do
I would ask you a favor, I have a question
Would you please tell me how to say to complement someone
My friend said me, \"You are a beast
I am wild as a beast
I think I am sure to be smart and handsome enough not to be said \"beast
I thought I could get higher score than the last one
I believed so
However, unfortunately, the score I got was not as good as had expected
I was disappointed at it a little
It was worse than the last one and before the last
The score got worse at straight two times
I couldn't get score at the listening test
Well, anyway, I was motivated to study hard
I will study hard to get higher score at the next test
It is a relay race where each runner run on the road and kilometers long distances usually
Ekiden relay race is very popular in Japan
University students run relaying from Tokyo to Hakone and run relaying back to Tokyo
Well, going on to my race on Sunday, Six runners in a team will run relaying on each leg
That is a very steep downward slope
I was wondering if my legs could withstand it
My thighs had felt somewhat sore for last race last Sunday and got being better right now
I wish I will be ready by Sunday
Please cheer me and my relay team up
I could not sign up the half marathon
It was already full and closed when I signed up
I will enjoyed the 10km at Shinjuku, which is the center of Tokyo, you know
I join a technology and business committee this fiscal year
It consists of members from various companies like me
We will discuss the environmental technology and its business and so on throughout a year
We will have the first meeting today afternoon
Its magnitude is about M7
Many people were dead and injured in it
Many buildings were collapsed, too
I hope their rehabilitation can be done as well and as soon as possible
There had been a very big earthquake in Kobe, Japan on Jan.17th, 1995
It was today in 15 years ago
It is called \"The Great Hanshin earthquake\" or \"Hanshin-Awaji Dai Shinsai\" in Japan
The magnitude was M7.3
People and buildings in the area had been damaged badly
We should prepare for coming earthquakes especially in Japan which is a country with frequent earthquakes
Rainy season is likely to come here soon in Kanagawa, Japan
There is the front line on the Pacific Ocean near Japan and we had some rain these days
I didn't bring a big umbrella but a small folding one yesterday
I should have bring a big one
I don't like folding umbrellas very much, because they are uncomfortable to bring when they are wet and folded, even if they are portable when they are dry
I don't like to bring a big one, too
I sometimes leave them in the train or anywhere, so I feel nervous whenever I bring one
Summer has already come, has it?  
But the highest temperature of the day here recently is above 20 degrees Celsius
By the way, I am surprised to see that chocolate bars which I keep in my desk for snack are a bit soften and sticky these days
They are not good while being sticky, aren't they
They lose crunchy and crispy taste
They stick to our fingers and then transfer to documents, desk, clothings, or whatever we touch with dirty fingers in summer time
It might be a disaster to stain important documents with chocolates
Or it may make stains on our white shirts
That would probably be a serious matter
That is why I keep coated chocolate balls or something for my snack instead of chocolate bars in summer days
Pay good attention to your chocolates in summer, everyone
Early bird can catch the worms
I get up at 4 o'clock on weekdays and at 6 on weekend
I am studying English with some textbooks and internet sites for studying English like Lang-8
Early in the morning, I think it is better to study, because it is so quiet that I can concentrate to study
How do you think about it 
Sunscreen attacked my eyes
My eyes hurt as posted yesterday
I wondered if that was really a case that a sunburn caused this inflammation as I posted
That's because I was used to spent more time under sun than yesterday without eye trouble like this
Well then, what caused this inflammation of my eyes, I wonder
I put on some sunscreen on my face before getting out
And after getting out, I sweated a lot like a river and got sweat in my eyes
The sunscreen flew into my eyes with this sweat
It hurted my eyes
That's why my eyes became red and inflamed, I guess
The sunscreen attacked my eyes, I'm sure
I rarely put on sunscreen before now
I didn't know how it hurts my eyes
Well, I learned
I am not going to put sunscreen above my eyes
It is still very hot, burningly hot, in daytime, but it gets cooler in the morning and the evening these days day by day
Yesterday evening, on the way home from work, I heard the sound of drums
I'm sure it was of practicing of traditional drums for the fall harvest festivals
Boys and girls play drums and their master plays flute at the local fall harvest festivals
They are very good at playing drums because they have practiced each year since they are small child
We have done for a long long time
I guess there are same or similar customs also in all another countries
How about in your place
There were notifications that my journal got comments or corrections before
However, not in these days
How is yours
We had a milestone meeting yesterday
We reported current situation of our work to decision makers including the president of our laboratory and representative of the enterprise devision
Unfortunately, Our development doesn't go very well
We have to slip our schedule
We got approval for further investigation and our renewal plan
I have sore muscles of all my body now
Both thighs, calves, back, and abdominal muscles feel sore considerably
Especially when stepping down stairs, my both thighs give a scream by pain
Should I take some rest for a while
I agree this
But I think the active rest is more effective than the passive rest with staying still or doing nothing
The tree-planting ceremony was held near my place
It was a very big ceremony there
It was because the Emperor and Empress came to plant trees by themselves
There are many roads had been repaired, re-paved or newly made around and towards the park where the ceremony was held for the ceremony in advance
The Emperor and Empress sowed some seeds and planted by hand some seedlings of trees including pollen-less cedars
It was pity that it rained all the time during the ceremony, but many other attractions were there, that was some dances, reading some essays, etc
We wish the trees will grow up healthily and we will could keep the beautiful mountain and nature
A lot of books pile up on it now
I have thought that I have to clean for months
Most books which sometimes I may read again should be there but it is really true
Books which I haven't read for long time don't have to be there, at the prime location
I will clean up them next weekend
He will graduate from the high school after finishing 3 year study there
He could spend great time there
We are very glad that
The graduation ceremony in Japan is like this
The graduates get some congratulatory speeches, the representative of them give the address in reply, each one of them get diploma from the principal, and then all attendants sing songs
Some day rain and some day shine
Before the summer is coming, it is getting hotter and more humid day by day
For example, I sweat a lot like a water fall while jogging yesterday
We have to take enough water, salt and electrolytes not to get dehydrated even not in mid summer
Besides, we have to get used to the heat and humidity gradually for coming hot summer
We have probably to restrict electricity consumption this summer
We are worried about the short of electricity for air-conditioning in this summer
Well, yes, I will tomorrow
How long does it take for you to commute
How long does it take for you to commute
I run from home to work for about 30min almost everyday
My wife goes to her work by bicycle for approximately 10min
My daughter goes to school by train and bicycle from the nearest station to her school for about 45min in total
My son goes to his university via approximately one and a half hour train trip
One and a half hour to go
Three hours in trains per a day, everyday
I can't say it is not too bad
We are planning to let him live alone in an apartment near his university or in a dormitory in the near future
Regarding the time, if he lives alone, he must do housework by himself
It takes time, but less than 3 hours a day, I hope so
He will learn a lot from experience
For not wasting his time, or not losing kinds of opportunities, we'd better to let him live alone probably
If he remains home, he can concentrate on his study without any houseworks bothering him
It would be better at one point of view
It is a difficult problem for us which would be better, he commutes from home, or he lives alone
Some time is needed to decide which and when we do
Summer Greeting
We Japanese have a custom to send postcards for Summer Greetings
But I think handwriting postcards or letters would be much more appreciated by recipient
I think it is not easy to write letters to someone when we have no news to tell them, but is easier to write Season Greetings
Why don't you send handwriting Summer Greeting Cards to someone sometimes
We have three day holidays this weekend in Japan
I am very sorry I have to go to office for the holiday work
The end of 1st period of the fiscal year is coming soon
Anyway, it's too beautiful for me to run straight to holiday work
I could not help but run some detour before heading to office
So, I enjoyed running in the fresh and clean air before work
Well, It's time to get down to work
We ran from Hiratsuka Sougo Koen Park to Enoshima and back
It was instead of the usual many lap route in the Hiratsuka Sougo Koen Park
The route was flat enough for easy running but somewhat lack of changes, I thought
It was not very hot because of cloudy and sometimes we had a little rain
I ran at an easy not race pace
A lot of fun
We spent for three hours from 7 to 10 pm without any electric lights
It got colder without any stoves
When the electricity came back at 10 pm, we found its preciousness
I found two fireflies flying on the way home from work yesterday
They are at about 5km apart from each other
Bravo, my countryside
I used to go out to see fireflies near our previous apartment before moving here our current place
There was a nice stream for fireflies and we protect them,  so we could see many fireflies there
I'm sure you will love it
Slight change of the life rhythm
Even a small change of life rhythm affects on our physical condition
I think I will get used to this new rhythm
I signed up for the Frostbite Road Race held in the Yokota Air Base on Jan
We can't always enter the base, but at like that event, we can enter there
It is about three months by then
I took a super express Hikari after a while
It was very comfortable, but we had some trouble with using prepaid card at the transition
My prepaid card is not usable for the super express, so I bought a ticket, and used it
After transition to the local train, my prepaid card should be usable for it, but I had an error at the ticket gate
I will go on a business trip from today to tomorrow
We will write a report about our research about the business strategies during this camp
It will be a huge work
We have been studying since last April, the beginning of the fiscal year of 2010, and we will complete and publish this report by the end of FY2010
Our work reaches the final stage
My desk is somewhat messy now
I have to clean to make a room on the desk
I discarded some magazines but it was not enough
More books and magazines should be discarded, but I can't decide which one to be discarded
There were some personnel changes in our office this April which is a beginning of the new fiscal year
I myself moved off to another section on the date of April 16th
I had been in charge of my former work for about six years
It seemed a very long time
My job in the former section was rather something like supporting service
Before that, I had been working at the front line of the research and develoment
I hoped to expand the sphere of my work
I sometimes asked my boss to let me move off back there again or to somewhere else
The new section where I moved to now is in charge of the R&D for producing new products
So I am glad to move off
I have to work harder and catch up with the regarding technologies and markets and so on at first immediately
I wish we can produce new great products and release them onto the market soon
I don't know why, but I always have something like troubles when I buy a watch
This time I bought a digital wristwatch of sport type for the lap time measurement while my running
I received it yesterday, but It was different from my ordered one
That was a bigger and heavier one which is not suitable for my running
The model numbers of my ordered one and of wrong one are very similar to each other
I want to exchange it, so I'll send a mail to the seller
Please make correction on it
I also want to know how to write simpler one and\/or business style one
I am looking forward to it very much
My high school's alumnus will play soccer, whose age are from about 20 to over 70, at a single team
Once or twice a year our club play matches against another senior soccer teams
We can enjoy playing soccer very much nevertheless we could not play smoothly as used to at high school days
Thereafter we go to a party and have a nice time chatting with each other about our recent state
We also help each other in both our public and private life
The special friendship seems because not only we graduated from the same school but we shared the same memories, atmosphere, something like that of our youth days , and so on
I am looking forward to meeting my alumnus and playing soccer with them very much
We need to make our cars to be taken a car safety inspection every two years in Japan
Our cars have to be checked their safety and we have to pay the maintenance fee, expensive tax and insurance
However, we forget to pay tax or something easily
I intend to go to a car maintenance shop for car safety inspection today
As you know well, we have a lot of work around the end of the fiscal year and also at the beginning of the fiscal year
We must review the achievements in the previous fiscal year and plan our target in the new fiscal year
We have to discuss about them with members of our working group
That is why we have busy days in every spring
I usual run to work, but take trains to work on rainy days
We had two-days rain, so I took trains
Since I have to take two trains to work and there are some time loss, it takes more time to go to work by train than on foot
On the other hand, the advance is that I can read books in the train
I could read some classic novels these two days
I still wear a short sleeve T-shirt and shorts while running to and from the office
And a vest on
But I felt a little cold around my arm last night
I wonder if it is time for wearing a long sleeve shirt
Is winter coming here
It was really amazing game
We are really encouraged
The 2nd half of the FSY 2011 started
I transferred to new office from October 1st
I have to move my things to new office and to prepare for commuting to new office
It will be busy this week
Overslept again
I am sure that I don't have enough sleep
Oversleep is just what I need
I wonder whether is better, to take some rest or to keep going to study in the early morning
I made it a habit to get up early and study for some  years
But I know I am in a lack of sleep recently
The best way is, I know, to go to bed early in the night
But it may be better to sleep more for some days rather than to keep going to be an early bird
Another typhoon is coming to Japan
It will arrive today and go over Japan today and tomorrow
I hope there would be no damage
I got up at six thin morning
I have to leave at six thirty
I don't have time for posting a journal
There are iPod shuffle and iPod nano and iPod touch
I got the shuffle several years ago first, I enjoyed listening musics while running and walking
Next, the nano was originally my son's and lent me last year
And I bought the touch this month for myself
Under WiFi circumstance, it acts as same as iPhone
With Skype app, I can make a call to someone
She decided to quit her school club activity after all
She had worried about it for long time
She loves to play badminton, but she got an injury on her leg
She can't continue to keep her motivation as before
Badminton is very competitive sports
It is funner with the competitiveness
She couldn't play as well as she wanted due to her leg injury
She couldn't win the matches as before
She had worried about this and that
Then after all, she decided to withdraw the badminton club
I am sorry but I think it is good decision for herself
Yesterday was the midsummer which has a longest daytime and a shortest nighttime
The sun rises about 4:30 and sets about 19:00 around the summer solstice day
How long that daytime is
However, we are in the rainy season in Japan at midsummer unfortunately, so we can't enjoy the longest daytime very much
Instead of that, around this midsummer, we enjoy watching the World Cup Soccer games held in South Africa on TV 
There is the time difference between here and there, so the games played in the shortest nighttime
Many soccer fans in Japan is now suffering from the lack of sleep by the W-Cup
Of course yes
It is a business trip there
It is my first time to there and it is the first time since the last travel abroad twenty years ago
I didn't remember the procedure to go abroad, for example, how to get a passport, what to bring with me, and so on
At the last time I went to America, I rent a bigger case for the 2-week trip, 20 years ago
This time, I will go for a 3-day 4-stay trip, I bought a carry-on-sized soft carry case
I will go jogging early in the mornings in Singapore for a kind of sightseeing, because I don't have enough time for sightseeing, otherwise
I look forward to doing it
It is about time to have early breakfast and leave home
Please wish my safe trip and successful business
Summer heat is being washed off by this rain and Fall will come here
When someone give us something, we say \"Sumimasen
When someone help us doing something, we also say \"Sumimasen
Sumimasen\" may usually be translated to \"I am sorry.\" or \"Excuse me.\" In these cases \"Sumimasen\" doesn't mean simple apology but means thanks
I don't know why actually it is, but I think we Japanese think it is a virtue to be modest during our long history, we are said to be modest and the modesty might have made us say \"Sumimasen\" to express thanks
When someone correct my poor English, I will possibly say \"Sumimasen\" as well as \"Arigatou
I picked up and asked the members for attending the meetings, and run the discussions there
We discussed some problems of our researches and made consensus what to do and how to do the tasks respectively
The four meetings took about two hours each and total took eight hours
I want to have more time and wish we could do more efficient meeting
The highest temperature hit 39.9 degree Celsius on September 5th in Kyoto
It was the highest in September ever recorded in Japan
However, we feel cooler and comfortable breeze blowing these days in the morning and the evening these days
Fall is coming day by day even if very slowly
We are really hope fall will come soon
Come to think of it, I think I have posted many journals about the temperature in this summer
I will take a TOEIC test on May 18th
I want to score more than the last time
To tell the truth, my score is decreasing at the last two tests
According to the increasing of concern about the globalization, my company recently showed that all employees have to be more global
13 is the birthday of my son
Happy birthday to him
He becomes 18 years old
He is a good, great, awesome son
I think so certainly
At least it is true for us, our family
He is healthy, vigorous, tender, diligent,...,well, I can't say enough about him
Maybe, I may overestimate him because I am his father and I love him very much
Anyway, I am very happy due to him
Of course, needless to say, my wife and his younger sister are happy, too
Our family is very happy
He has been preparing for the entrance exams to universities
of his first choice will be on Feb
There is no time before the exams, but he seems to have been going smoothly with his preparation
I believe that
Took train to Machida, walked around the town, browsed some shops, and finally I bought a pair of shoes
It is what I wanted and looking for
I was lucky to get it at 20% discount price
It was a nice shopping
I wrote we have snow in February or March on yesterday's journal
That came true this year again
it didn't not piled up at all here this time
By the way, today February 11th is a national holiday in Japan which is celebrated as the National Foundation Day
I have no plan for today now
Do you know a relay marathon race
Have you ever participated in that
At the year-end party after the last run in 2009 on Dec.26th, my friends and I chatted to each other with some alcohol about plans of running  in the next year respectively
One of my friends has taken part in some 100km races before, and another has not yet
They are interested in it, but 100km is too long for unexperienced guys, they said
The experienced friend suggested that we all should participate in a relay marathon together in one team
In a relay race, each runner can run appropriate distance and time according to his ability
Some 24h relay marathons were held in Japan
Our two picks among them will be held in July or in September
How long distance can we run for 24hours, do you think
We must do more long distance and long time training without enough sleep for the straight 24h race
We need some more participants, too
How many participants do you think are needed for a 24h relay race
We think 8 is minimum, and 12 is better
Do you think we are weird, run-holic guys
Fruitful Sunday
Such as my hair cut, mow grass, wash cars, jog, and more
I took very much crowded train last evening
I went to Tokyo on business and attend the meeting of a committee discussing how to make innovations
It sounds very difficult, isn't it
Yes, it is very difficult to answer to the problem
We have been holding some of this meetings during one year to make out our own answer for that
Well, after the meeting, I took a subway and a private railway go back home
The evening trains in Tokyo area are always very crowded
My train was fully loaded with people who were going back home from work or from school
I mostly had to stand on one foot for some time
I could not put my another foot on the floor
After more than one and half hour struggling in the train, I could finally sit on the seat
As said yesterday, I will run a marathon in Tokyo
Rain is even good for running if it is not very heavy
Especially, this marathon is not for competition of speed, but for enjoying the famous sightseeing site in Tokyo while we are running slowly
We have more four hours until starting the race and I will leave home in an hour
I hope this rain stop or ease off until the start
There is an earthquake now here in Kanagawa, Japan
It is not so big
The strong wind warning was issued early in this morning
I heard the news in the train to the starting site
I was looking forward this marathon a lot and prepared for it
But, we could do nothing about it
The wind was getting weaker and it almost stopped raining, therefore my friend and I decided to go jogging at the Imperial Palace instead of the cancelled marathon
We jogged 2 laps there,  about 10km,  and then we took a train for about 2hours back home
My body feel sore now because of Saturday's soccer
Some muscles and joints are sore
I regularly run, but my muscles got sore after soccer
The exercise intensity was stronger than usual running
This sore is not very serious, even it feel good for myself
Surely be a busy week
I have a kind of presentation next Tuesday, so I have to prepare for it
It will take much time to prepare the presentation, I guess
And I have to organize some meetings this week
There are three or four, or maybe more
I will make the plan for those meetings and cheer them and then make the proceedings
Furthermore I have parties on Tuesday and Friday evening
It is the first rain in a long while
I think we didn't have rain for more than 2 months
I can't remember the last rain
We have little rain here in Kanagawa prefecture, next to Tokyo
It is good from one point of view, but not very good from another one
Taking good sleep may refresh myself
We used to celebrated the new adults aged 20 on the Coming of Age Day on Jan.15, the little New Year, prior to 2000
They come back to hometown on the day and celebrated
Girls wear Japanese traditional clothings \"Kimono
There is an article of the little New Year but in Japanese
My daughter has a fever since the day before yesterday
She seldom catch a cold and has kept a perfect attendance since the entrance to the elementary school eight years ago
So, she seems to feel sorry for herself very much
Yesterday, she was taken to a doctor and checked if she get a flu
The test result was negative and it said she caught a ordinal cold
We are relieved then
But in the evening, her temperature raised over 38 degrees Celsius again
Many of her classmates are absent from school because of flu yesterday
We are still thinking she have a flue
She is going to be checked again and given appropriate medicines today
I ran into my old friend on the way just before getting home yesterday
It was fancy to see her again there
She said her family had recently moved to our neighborhood
We had lived next to each other in an apartment more than 15 years ago
She has a son of a same age as my son
They used to play together almost everyday when they were toddlers
After my family had moved out, her son and my son played soccer at each teams and played some matches sometimes when they were elementary school boys
After a long interval, not keeping in touch, we happened to meet by accident
We made a promise to meet again with both families and said goodbye
I felt glad to have seen her and heard her family going well
The quarrel between my wife and my daughter seemed finished
A peace came back to my home
I relieved
The yesterday's dinner was Japanese \"nabe\" stew
The forecast says that much more ceder pollen fly this year than usual
It will be about several times of last year
My eyes feel itchy and my nose are runny even with mask
I take some pills for allergy
The work well usual, but their effect may not be strong enough to fight against much pollen this year
Someone will do longer
Headphone was about to die
My headphone for my iPod is something like out of order
Sounds come from only right side, not from left one
I think there is something trouble like a bad contact
It is probably because the plug became a little rusty by my sweat
I want to get a new pair of headphones before the current one is dead
I change headphones about twice a year, I'm not sure
I am now wondering which one I will buy for the replacement
For my jogging use, high graded, expensive one isn't needed
Use up a ballpoint pen
It was a slight event, but I felt happy a bit
I have already set a new refill into the ballpoint pen
It is not expensive one, but costs 100yen
What do you have anything like this slight but happy event
A big earthquake took place in New Zealand yesterday
I wish the damages were not very serious
Are you OK, everyone in New Zealand
Big earthquakes may take place at some interval after the former big one
So we have to be sensitive and careful against the maybe coming next one
But where and how did they come from
As you know, the frogs lay eggs in water and tadpoles grow up in the water
However, my house is located somewhat apart from a water place where frog's eggs and tadpoles grow
Rice fields are some blocks apart from my house where they mostly seem to grow
And for what they come and live in my garden
Anyway they are cute and loved by my family
I posted my previous entry of \"Delivery error?\" ; 
This is a sequel to it
The internet coffee shop sent new one the day before yesterday
Since I had contacted the shop and the home delivery agent and asked to send me the substitution
It is very fast delivery
On the other hand, the eBay seller replied me that he had sent the other replacement watch to me
One of my tooth filling came off when I was eating a candy the day before yesterday
It was lucky I didn't swallow it but I could keep it
I went to the dentist to let it filled in the cavity of my tooth again yesterday
I am happy it took very short time
Do you have any cavities now or already fixed
My first trip abroad on business
I will go to Singapore on business from next Sunday to Wednesday
It is my first trip abroad on business and the second trip abroad after the one to US about 20 years ago
I had to have a new passport issued and buy a carry case and some other stuffs for it
I am excited and nervous about it a little now
I wonder I should have traveled abroad on private, not on business by now
It was like a mid Spring day some day, and like a late Winter day the other day
We are easy to catch cold or to got sick in the weather like that
It is probably because I went to a business trip in the cold rain yesterday and stayed outside without my overcoat which was out to drycleaner's
It was chilly cold yesterday
We had my office X'mas party yesterday
It was very crowded, rather packed like a commute train car, in the cafeteria where the party was held
Many drinks and dishes were served, but more people were there, so I thought they were not much enough, it was short of quantity
Besides, we had some exhibitions on the stage
Some played musical instruments, dance, or the other party exhibitions
They sounded like very fun, but I couldn't watch nor hear them because of the happy and noisy crowd
We spent fun and relaxed hours at the party
That is, I was very lucky to have won the 1st prize of lottery at the party
It was travel coupons
I will go on a one-stay trip with my family to a hot spring not so far
I overslept again this morning
I stayed up late last night to set a new version of ubuntu OS
Some trouble seemed to happen, upgrading to 10.10 was failed
So I had to re-install the ver.10.10 with CD-R
It took a long time to download the disk image and install it on my computer
I wrote something like an excuse, and I think of it as today's journal
Time fly by
And have you ever made good progress of that or finished that until now
And for myself
But I feel time fly by at very fast speed
Don't rush for anything, but take it easy
I went to a barber shop to got my hair cut
It is popular even for men to go to a hair salon in Japan now
But I like to go to the barber shop and go there once every two months near my place
It is very suitable especially for the summer
So did I this time, the day before yesterday, too
I got refreshed
There are four runner per a team, each one will run from about 2.5 to 3.7km respectively
Our team won the 6th prize last year and the 4th before the last
We will try to get better place this year
He has run this relay races many times
We want let him enjoy the one more than ever
Microsoft had announced they will no longer support the Windows 2000 any more
Therefore, for the secure use of them, 2K PCs were at last to get replaced
What I got actually was an older PC than that I was using
It has the Pen4 processor,  only 500mb RAM, and 40gb HDD
It is a reuse PC which had retired from work before
It was poor specs, not enough for my daily work
I can use some newer application softwares on XP
Please let me say excuse for my oversleep
I am tired and lack of sleep
Today is St Valentine's Day
I bought him a new snowboard jacket and pants as the birthday present
My daughter made some cupcakes for the Valentine's Day's presents
Cold days got back these days, nevertheless it is March
In early spring, we have four warm days after three cold days, and then it is getting warmer
This rain will wake plants up for coming spring
I hope this rain wash off the ceder pollen which cause the hay fever
The weather news said this summer was the hottest among the last over 100 years in Japan
It's the spring drizzle, so I'll walk to wet through it...? 
I heard someone on TV said \"It's the spring drizzle, so I will walk to wet through it
Not sure because it is long ago, when a servant put up an umbrella for his master, the master replied the words to the servant
I have a marathon today
I don't like running in the rain very much certainly
That is why I said the words above
Umm, okay, okay, It is just a spring drizzle, I will run to wet through it
I can have a day off work today
Have a good weekend, all
I could not sleep enough this week, suffering from sleepless,  so I could not get up as early as usual
Do you think we can stock sleeping for the next sleepless weekdays
However, too much sleep may makes us rather more sleepy unfortunately, as you know
Anyway, I wish you all have a good weekend
It has been cold these days since last week
it is a little warmer
Cherry blossom Viewing is very popular in Japan
It will get warmer by little and little
Spring will come soon in my place
How about is in your place
I registered for the TOEIC test on May
I have taken the tests for four times before
After a long long interval, the second time was 3 years ago, and after that, I took them approximately once a year
I think it is good for checking my English skill, and also it motivate me well to study English
I should study harder, vocabulary, grammar, listening, business terms, etc
And I have to practice the quick reading and quick answering because there are so many questions and little time
Well, Yes, OK, I'll do my best and gonna get a better score than last time
It is getting hotter
It feels like summer days here in Japan these days
How is your place
My wife and I went cycling with my wife
This is an annual event of us in Golden Week
This is the almost only my long ride in a year
It was cloudy but nice weather condition
There were a lot of people in Kamakura and Enoshima on holiday
I went for a business trip to a convention center near the Tokyo Tower yesterday
Tokyo Tower has antennas for television broadcasts, was modeled after the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which is 333 meters tall and built in 1958
We love to go to aquarium, because we love fish and sea animals as well as we can feel cooler there
What shall I do this year
I will make my family happier at first of all
And then, I will make every others happier
And at the last, I feel myself happy
I will not set myself at the first, but at the last
I found many colorful flowers in the garden on the way to work
They are very pretty
Fall is coming soon even if it is still very hot
I really hope so
We had a strong wind yesterday
I ran against the strong headwind at lunchtime
I couldn't run forward and even about to be blown off
If I had wings, I could glide into the air
Actually, my wife said the laundries were blown off by the wind
The strong southern wind was caused by the winter style of the pressure systems
Full blooming Sakura
I show you some photos of full booming cherry blossoms in my neighborhood
I was sorry it was a bit cloudy, but as shown in these photos, we could enjoy seeing sakura flowers
You can see oilseed rape flowers below sakura trees in the 1st photo
The yellow flowers are cute and beautiful by contrast with the pink sakura flowers
In the small river, that probably should be called brook or creek, wild \"medaka\" fish live
Medaka is Japanese rice fish
It is very popular in Japan, we love it very much
The youtube video shows you \"Medaka no gakkou\"; \"School of Japanese rice fish\", that is very popular traditional children's song
I'm afraid that wild medakas are very rare because they are in danger of extinction unfortunately
Anyway, we have a lot of hanami parties this weekend here and there in Japan and enjoy sakura
The typhoon has gone at all
Many people were killed and many buildings were broken
Natural disasters are too much cruel
I have a footrace today on Sunday
The race is held near my home, which is about 2km far
I have to walk outside in the morning
I will walk from one work site to another
I will carry some luggage, and I have to keep it from getting wet
Wireless LAN has something trouble
The wireless LAN in my house has something trouble right now
It doesn't make a connection well
I don't know what no why is happened
I don't have enough time to fix it
The very hot summer was gone
Time flies fast
I think it is very fast
We should spend the precious time more fruitfully, don't you think so
I think so all time, but I don't think I can do so
What do you think about it
How do you take care to spend your time fruitfully
Last night, he was wondering what liberal arts classes he choose
And she was worrying how to commute, on what route she goes to school by bicycle from the nearest station to her school
They are fresh newcomer, you know
I am so happy to see them starting their new school lives
I control myself not to help them too much
They should be prepare for their new lives by themselves
I hope they will be able to do kinds of things by themselves for their ages
It is somewhat hard for me and my wife to tolerate not to give them a hand on purpose
They seem little kids for us forever
We hope they two adjust to that new their school lives
The weather news said the rainy season had started here
Unfortunately, I didn't run one
This is an email to my new running friend who became friends with me recently on a runners SNS site
He is preparing to try to run sub-3 hours marathon at the Tokyo Marathon next month
He ask me when I am planing to give a first try to run sub-3
My PR is 3 hour 12 min at the last Lake Kawaguchi
My next try may be at the Arakawa River on March 21
And my first ultra marathon is the Challenge Fuji Five Lakes which will be on April 25th
So I am wondering if I should try to run sub-3 at Arakawa or to run at easier pace for keeping my physical condition well
I hope you can run sub-3
Go for it and Good luck
Many small makes a great
Everything is made of an aggregation of single small steps
Even to climb a big mountain, we should take each step at a time
We have a Japanese proverb like this, \"Chiri mo tsumoreba yama ni naru\", that means \"Many dust makes a big mountain
On the other hand, In English proverb, \"Many small makes a great\", \"Many drops make a shower\", and \"Many sands will sink a ship
It was said to be caused by infection disease of hemolytic streptococcus
I had sudden fever and pain in joints of whole body just like flu
I left work early, took OTC cold medicine, and go to bed to take a rest
I was suffering from the high fever and pain in whole body on the bed
Unfortunately, however, that was in vain
I felt terrible even when sitting on a chair caused by the fever then
I went to see a doctor
I was checked my nose mucosa and urine
My this disease was said an infection of hemolytic streptococcus
I was prescribed an antibiotic, adding to cold medicine, anti fever medicine, and stomach medicine
Joint pains was also relieved gradually
I will clean the room today
Well, I declare that I will clean this room today afternoon
I have to do what I declare
I can't keep away from doing what I make public on the internet
There are some books, some clothes, not any wastes, but some other goods
I will put them in appropriate places
OK, yes, I will do it this afternoon after I will come back home
I awake several times during sleeping at night because of the heat and humidity
We have sleepless days in this summer
I get up early in the morning to write my journals everyday, but today, I fell asleep again at desk, so I had no time to write a journal
This was my excuse of today
Many marathon races are cancelled in Japan because of the quake
I get a call which said that one on May 8th was cancelled
We will work for it as volunteer staff as usual
The chief organizer called me last night
We are very sorry, but can't be helped
My Kindle is dead at the first time
I forget that it is an electric device
I love this device with the low energy consumption e-Paper display instead of LCD one
After the heavy rain brought by the big typhoon, the river flow with the full width
I hope no more rain fall
I received boots that I bought from a web shop
They were very cool, much cooler than expected
I was pleased a lot, of course
However, I had a trouble
The size that I ordered was half-size smaller than my usual sneakers, but it was still bigger
So I asked the web shop to change them to smaller ones
I am waiting the replacement coming
I ran a long way round back home from work under the moonlight
It was almost full moon
We Japanese like full moon
I have heard that full moon is not liked very much in other countries
Is that because wolf men would come to you
For night runners it is better safe under lighter moonlight
After tough work, I called it a day about ten o'clock
I felt exhausted from yesterday work
I went to the locker room and changed clothes
When I got out of the building, I found it was raining, unfortunately
It was brightly sunny in daytime yesterday
I forgot to bring my umbrella at home
My coworker kindly proposed me to lend me his extra one
I asked his favor to lend it to me
So I could walk back home with an umbrella
But on the way home, the rain got heavier and heavier, it rained cats and dogs
I put the rain cover on my backpack not to got wet
After about thirty minute walk home, I got almost soaked
It is time for my son and daughter to decide their future course respectively
He has to select his major at his university and she has to select her university or universities she will go
They are thinking of their future course seriously and ask their parents, us, to advise them
I feel delighted that they are growing up, but a little lonely because they are going to leave us before very long
It is raining outdoor now
It was a long time since the last rain
This rain and heat in these days will enhance the growth of plants
For example, the lawn grass in our garden is now turning green
It is a hilly race which has long steep ascents and long steep descents, held around Mt
The elevation of the starting point is approximately 1000m high and the highest one seems 1300m
Adding to that, the temperature is said to reach 35 degrees Celsius tomorrow
What do you imagine from that name
We will enjoy the heat climate as well as the tough course of the race
Spring will come soon
Maybe it has already come
Moreover, the season of cedar pollen has come
I already feel something wrong with nose
And I have a runny nose now and then
It is because of the allergic rhinitis of cedar pollen
Many people must put up with the cedar pollen allergy for a wile in the Spring
We have runny nose, sneeze, eye itch, some fever, and so on
It is a very tough season
Are you okay everyone
Free from the hay fever or other allergic diseases
It was red with ton of red hot chili peppers and extremely hot
It was my first time to go to the ramen shop
I picked up a trash, that was a bread wrapping, on the road on the way to work the day before yesterday
Then, I felt good
It is very easy for us to pick up a trash, but we don't do so
The trash may be thrown by someone, not by myself
We may always think so
But when I picked it up, I felt good certainly
We shall do at least one good thing a day
Even if it is a slightly thing
To close conversations
I learned how to say for closing conversations
Surprisingly, maybe I have not learned that until now
I don't know why it is
I wonder if I may have forgot it
Well, words for closing conversation are very important to make ourselves feel good at our good conversation
For example, as a formula
We must get together sometime
I will say as mentioned above
It seems this week was short
Maybe it was because I was out of office to business trip for two days
I have a stuck of things to do in this week
Today will be a busy day for myself
USA team made a lead, Brazil turned a game around, USA caught up, Brazil lead, USA caught up again at the injury time of the extra game
Students were playing some kinds of exercises and mass games
This mass game means that many students dances synchronizingly in same dresses with musics
The dance is original by students and dresses are sewn by themselves
Thanks a lot for your corrections always
I appreciate you make corrections and leave comments on my journal all the time
Sometimes I am afraid if I can improve my English
But, NO, I realize I could
I will keep studying English here and will post journals everyday as possible
My wife and I went to a short trip to Hakone yesterday
It was my first time to take the train
The train climbs the very steep incline of Hakone mountain by the switching back way
There are some volcanic hot water springs and steams with sulfur smell
The black egg is famous, which is boiled in the volcanic hot spring and the shell is turned black caused by sulfur and iron compounds in it
They say we can live seven years longer by eating every one egg
We ate two eggs respectively, so we will be able to live 14 years longer and we can enjoy the extended lifetime
On the way back home, we enjoyed riding the older, cute retro style railroad cars, which has no air conditioners
we opened the windows and enjoyed the cooler air in the highland
We will go again in another season
My son moved
My son moved to his apartment yesterday to start his first single life
I feel glad that he grew up, but at the same time, I feel sad by missing him
My home seems like lacking some significant pieces
Would you please pray for his good luck
It is a word for rewarding everyone who works hard for whole week
My office is also a day off today, but I have to go to my office to get some parts of my lot of work done
It contains, for example, considering the experimental results for planning what to do next, and making a plan for long and medium-term R&D strategy, as well as writing a letter to Singapore for making the appointment to visit some research institutes there
I have a lot of work to get them done immediately
We will jog to the same site where my profile picture of Mt
Fuji was taken at the last run in2008
We will jog for 26km of total length, up to about 700m of elevation, and down back
We can have a greatly fun time while jogging very slowly, chatting each other about anything happened to us in this year
We have enough time to do that, because it takes about 4 hours to jog over today's course
After that, we will enjoy taking a hot spring and drinking some or a lot of beer
But, I am very sorry about the weather
Please stop raining and give us more sunshine 
Ran this race yesterday
High temperature, high elevation, much of long and steep uphills and downhills
Strong sun burned us through the clear air in the highland
In the shades, cooler breeze in the highland was cozy and water was very delicious
I love it
Here is a good news
I can't tell you how relieved we are with my poor English
She had made many efforts and had done very well
I hope, believe rather than hope, that the good news would come after the good news
My daughter, who is 16 years old, is now suffering from her stress
Her stress seems to cause her overeating
She says she doesn't know what makes her stress exactly
I hope she can overcome her stress and get back to her mentally healthy life
I would like someone advise her to overcome her stress
Why did the accident happen
There was a traffic accident on the road next the play ground while we were playing soccer
A truck suddenly ran into a fence of the ground
It ran over the sidewalk and ran into the chain-link fence at slow speed
The truck didn't so much collapsed, and another cars and people didn't get involved luckily
It was very luckily
We called a police and an ambulance
There came policemen, an ambulance
And also an fire-engine came there without knowing why, no fire was there
According to the policemen, the driver seemed to get unconscious while driving, and go into the fence
My friend also said the driver was not seen  at the crush, he seemed to have fallen down under the seat
But we weren't let to know why the driver had got unconscious
The driver was bring to a hospital by the ambulance
We hope him not to be in so bad condition and get better soon
Internet auctions afterward
I sold my unwanted things on internet auctions these days
I luckily got some money and had fun, more than expected
However, some items didn't attract anyone and no one bid on them
I wonder whether I had better to throw them off, or to drop their starting prices
We have planned blackouts for saving electricity
The blackouts will be planned to shut the electricity for three and half hours in Kanto, Tohoku and Chubu districts which divided into five areas in order
My area is the 4th area
This electric power cut will be continued for long time
My father in law visited our home the day before yesterday
He stayed here for a night and left for playing golf early in the morning yesterday
Our home are located near his favorite golf courses, so he often comes over to our home on the way to there
Have you ever heard it
Dan\" means deny, \"Sha\" means throw away, \"Ri\" means separate
We can get a simple life by denying, throwing away and separating from any bothering things around us
I have a lot of such things rarely used or almost wastes
I am sure you know my feeling
There is a common saying that \"疾風に勁草を知る\" in Japan
It has same meaning as an English proverb: In a calm sea every man is a pilot
The saying is translated to \"We can know which plant is a really strong one only in strong wind
We can know who is really tough only in tough situations
Adding to that, sometimes we may get into a difficult and tough situation of anything, we should think it is a good chance for improving ourselves
I'm sorry if it sounds too much didactic
I just happened to remember this saying while running in the headwind
Ran to th public bath
Friends and I had a plan for refreshing ourselves
That was, to jog to a public bath, which is called Sento in Japan, to take a bath together, and then to go for drink
Isn't it sounds good
We did enjoy it
About 2 hour jog was very fun while chatting with 4 men instead of the dark evening
We can have a day off from work tomorrow
We have two day holidays on weekend usually, but we had work last Saturday for avoiding the rotating power cuts
It was irregular, so I felt that I could not refresh enough last weekend
However, while the warmer the weather gets, the less the electricity consumption
So we will not have power cuts for a wile at least in this April
Written above is not the April Fool, of course
Hoping world peace
We everyone hope world peace
We have many friends all over the world thanks to development and spread of internet communications
For example, we can use useful sites like this site lang-8
The development of science technologies must be used for realizing world peace and for reducing starvation and poverty
We should make every efforts to realize world peace
What can we ourselves do for that
Marathon race yesterday
I ran a marathon race yesterday
For the practice of next weekend's ultra marathon, I planned to run at the ultra pace, about 6'30\" \/ km
It was not so easy to run at slower than the comfortable pace
So instead of that, I ran there alone yesterday
I like Fuji Five Lakes, which have nice scenery
I felt very good, but a little alone while running
Anyway, it was a good substitution
A nice new week
Another new week started
I have a headache a little this morning
The weather forecast said it would be cooler from Monday last week
it said it would be cooler from Tuesday on Sunday, from Wednesday on Monday
Summer is still staying here and Fall hasn't come here
Some young worms of butterflies are on the branches of citrus trees in our garden
Our lemon tree and grapefruits trees are almost leafless
I hope they can turn beautiful butterflies
Hang in there, Japan National Team! 
Yesterday Japan National Soccer Team won Denmark one and can advance to the knock-out stage
We Japanese were very glad of that
In spite of the time of the game, it was 3, early in the morning, or late in the night, many people watched the game on TV
To tell the truth, we didn't really expect the advances of Japan Team, because they lost all of test games before the World Cup
So we didn't believe they would be able to advance to the final tournament, called the knock-out stage
We are very glad and proud of their awesome plays and performances
We hope they could win the games one after another in the tournament
Hang in there, Japan Team
I share you an interesting figure
Which way do you see the cat is turning, clockwise or counterclockwise
Happy Merry Christmas to you all
I had also some time to review the questions
I thought it was better than last time, which was taken last year
However, the better I think is not always the better the score is
I hope I could get good score
I think my English skill is getting better step by step
I worked late till about 11pm yesterday
I got tired very much
So did yesterday too
I ran back home from work for half an hour at about 11pm last night
Half sleeping while running
My eyes half shut
I was about to sleep while running
I slapped myself on the cheeks sometimes not to get to sleep on the way
I didn't think I could not do so, but now I think I probably can
But it will be very dangerous, of course you know
We must be careful on the way not to get in an accident
Cut the hedge
I made a heavily pruning this time
Twelve big dust bags were filled with cut blanches and leaves
I hit a bike on the way home from office last night
The accident happened on the dark sidewalk
The bike ran approaching straight toward me from my front side
I stepped to my right side
He turned to my same side unfortunately, so the bike bumped straight into me
The bike fell down and the biker fell on the ground, too
I worried about his head, but he said he was alright
The bike speed was not very fast, so he had no injury
I had no injury at all luckily
Did I got interviewed
I interviewed some applicants, who were university students or graduate school students
They presented their work at their university at first, and we asked some questions for examining whether they are appreciate to join our company or not
It was my first time to do this
So I was somewhat nervous, of course less nervous than applicants
I'm sure it was very difficult to estimate someone's abilities, at least for me now
It seemed to me that they all are great guys now or in the future, even some of them didn't make very good presentation at this time
I felt fatigued,even exhausted after finished all the interviews
We have much rain in this season
I completely get soaked by the rain
My body needs longer sleep
They are two weekly reports and one monthly report, to my laboratory president
Hot summer has gone
It was cooler last night
Has hot summer gone with the rain at last
I feel glad if it will be true, but at the same time, I feel kind of sorry
How was this summer for you
How did you enjoy this summer
I ran some detour before heading to office
While jogging along Sakawa river path, I caught up with a runner and cheered him, we didn't know each other by then, we jogged along and chatted for a while
He said he is planning to run a half marathon next month and practicing for it
I didn't know the Father's Day was not the event only in Japan
It said \"Thanks, dad.\" I was very pleased, of course
We should do good to our parents, needless to say
I made an entry into an 100km marathon race
It is \"100km\" marathon
it is twice longer than an ordinary \"42.195km\" marathon
It will be held in April 25th, 2010
This is my first time to run a 100km race, so I don't know what will happen to me in the race and whether or not I will be able to finish it
I will do training and enjoy running myself and I will definitely accomplish it
What will happen to me when I can finish it
It is taller and bigger and has many flowers than other kinds
It starts blooming from the southern part to the northern part of Japan, so the the Sakura-Zensen , the front line of cherry blossom, goes for the north day by day
I went jogging to one of the famous cherry blossom seeing sites to check the degree of its blooming
They will not start blooming
I thing two weeks later will be best timing to see and enjoy them
I will go running a maranic today
This maranic is not a marathon competition race, but a marathon distance of easy fun run
The word \"maranic\" is made of the marathon and picnic
It is very fun and good for a marathon training
I should be careful not to slip down
This photo was the view of the rural area which has a paddy field and Mt
I took this photo yesterday while running at the cycling road where I jog weekly
The paddy field doesn't have water in winter
It was a very fine day with no cloud in the sky
The sharp contrast is very beautiful among the blue of the sky, the white of the snow on the mountain, and the color of withered rice plants on the soil
The rainy season front line stays near Japan during the period because of the power balance among the high pressure systems and the low pressure systems
The rainy season brings us a lot of harvests in the coming summer and autumn as well as rain
He becomes 41 years old
He has been living in Fukuoka, where is Kyusyu area, in the eastern part of Japan
The elder one entered to his elementary school this April
The two brothers are very vigor and said to have fights constantly by their mom
I wonder if my brother and I made fights with ourselves in our childhood
Well, the 41years old is said to be the critical age for a man in Japan
My daughter and mi wife are arguing now again
My daughter is in her regular exam now
She is not in the very good condition mentally because she has injury in her shin and can't play badminton which she love
She is not in a good mood and that makes her mother angry
Women are difficult, whether young or not so young
We have \"No overtime work day\" of our company on every Sunday
We must leave office before 5:25
It doesn't matter if we finished today's work or not, we must wrap them up and leave
We Japanese are so diligent, even containing somewhat ironic meaning, that we have a tendency to work too much
Someone might happen to lose his health
To say the truth, we may feel relief while working on everyday's stuffs, and may feel somewhat anxious while we have some free hours in the evening on a weekday
We don't have any idea what to do and how to spend it
Working overtime has been like a routine
About one year passed since the No overtime day began, we are now enjoying our after-fives in each ways
TOEIC test
It takes 150 minutes consisting of the listening test and the reading test
We need to keep concentrating during its long testing time
I have been studying a bit hard for it
This is my fourth test
I will do my best in order to get a high score on the exam
The thermometer said my fever of 39 degrees C
I had no headache or no stomachache, but only high fever
It was a long time since last time I had caught a cold
It was getting harder to work, to walk, to stand up gradually
I took a cold medicine and a fever reducer, then I went to bed to lie down to rest
In the afternoon, the fever was reduced and I was getting better and better
I have an eye pain now
My eyes got bloodshot
It's probably because of a sun burnt
I spent many time under the sunshine yesterday
waterfall training
I saw this yesterday on the way of the trail running on the mountain trail with friends
They were beaten by the very cold water under the waterfall while yelling some Buddhist sutra
I am not sure but they may be training as Buddhist monks or for becoming Buddhist monks
As you see, they were almost naked except only Fundoshi's, that is Japanese traditional men's underware, I don't have my own, unfortunately
Have you ever done the waterfall training or seen like this actually
I think you don't like blisters, too
I cut the skin and remove the body fluid in the blister by myself
Now, It doesn't hurt any more
Although I think you good boys should not emulate this my action
You had better see a doctor or something, maybe
Two rabbits, a big crab, side face of a woman, ..., Please tell let me know that
I will transfer to another section
My wife and daughter live in my house
My family will split
We have cooler nights these days than before
They are good for getting goon sleep
They can be
But I can't get good sleep for a couple of months
I have only shallow and short sleep
I wake up several times in the night almost every day
I feel sleepy in the daytime
It is not efficient to work while I feel sleepy
I am in trouble with it
That was why I couldn't run to work and not go out for a lunchtime jog
I wanted to run because I'm now going on challenging to run every single day, you know, as posted a few days before
Therefore, I dared to run through the rain back home from work in my casual wear, which was not for running, like a pair of jeans, a casual shirt and a jacket, and additionally with the umbrella up
I probably looked like a person in a hurry to somewhere, for example, not to be late for a train, work, dinner, or something
Anyway I could get some run yesterday
Three cold and four warm
It is raining outdoors just now
it is a cold rain
I hope it is not so cold in Tohoku disaster area
Everyone can do it, but anyone don't either want to do it or do it in practice
I started this goal last December
I ran at the gym in the heavy rain sometimes
It was very lucky for me achieving the goal that my local region in Kanagawa pref
That said, anyway, it is not so easier said than done
It will be fine today, so I can run outside, and I will achieve my goal
I can't help waiting to go running today
The letters with fountain pens look better than those with ballpoint pens, I think
The feeling of writing is more smooth, so it's more comfortable for me, too
It is a casual, not expensive, but stylish one
I set an ink converter on it, filled my favorite ink in it, and wrote some letters
I loved it
But there was something trouble with it
It must be repaired
or replaced?, I wondered and asked to the pen shop I bought from
They said that a repair is not necessary, it will be all right with washing, drying up and resetting the ink converter
And then, the ink stopped leaking from my favorite pen
I loved it more than before, needless to say
At the ambassador  secretary office
I went to an ambassador secretary office to have a meeting yesterday
It was the first time to go to such place
I didn't have any of such opportunities ever before
It was for discussing about our visit to the country
I met an ambassador secretary and talked with him
He spoke Japanese very fluently as if he was Japanese and introduced us his country's industry and economy, which is his work, of course
He may probably become an ambassador or at something important post some day, I believe
This visit was very good experience for myself
I went to a barbershop to make my hair cut
But the shop was closed unfortunately
It is usually open on weekend
I think it should open on weekend
Were there any troubles or something over the shop
I wish you have a great year 2011
I gonna go to see the first sunrise at the top of a mountain
Both teams scored and scored, the match was 2-2 after the game
In the extra game, both teams added goals, and the match went into a penalty shootout
I was very excited to watch the game
That's why I am now lack of sleep
My brother took his fiancee to our home to introduce her
We we were a little nervous at first, but we made friends with each other soon
She is a very nice women
We are also pleased that their marriage
I watched the world cup qualifying game of Japan against Uzbekistan late last night
It was a kind of exciting game
But Japan team looked like less aggressive, so they could not get goals until the second half
I thought they had to be more aggressive for getting goals
They have to shot more
I ran a 10km race at the monthly road race yesterday
That is my 40th consecutive race of the monthly road race
It was freezing cold and sleeting furthermore yesterday
Usually, about 30 participants run
8 or more newbies joined us this time, and around 70 ran in that condition
Running, and jogging got very popular now in Japan, because of the recent health consciousness
More than 200 thousand sent applications to the Tokyo Marathon 2010, it was far more oversubscribed
Running boom is now in Japan
What about in your country
I wish spring is coming soon
It is cold everyday
I wish spring is coming soon
I will go to a business trip from today even during my summer holidays
Did this business trip make me not to go to our private trip
No, we planned to go to our private trip after my business trip
I will go to Kobe on my business trip, and after that, I will join my family to go to Kyoto

In addition, we have one TV shared among our family
I want to see some series of dramas at top priority
I like a historic story, a suspense story, an action story, and so on, and keep them in the HDD
How can I pick up from them
I went to office yesterday, on Saturday, because I had some work to do
But I couldn't concentrate on my work then, so I called it a day early and went shopping and browsing for refreshing myself
I bought an used pair of levis for my daughter
It was a nice shopping
It seems to us a kind of Fall sounds
Several kinds of insects , or bugs, are singing their love songs
While I didn't notice that, buzzing of summer cicadas decreased and singing of fall insects increased
Sounds of fall as well as smells of fall are increasing around us
Methods for training of the brain for victory for runners by Prof
Nariyuki Hayashi, who is a professor of Dept
of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Nihon Univ., are quoted below
Imagine concretely what you implement
Make your best efforts and 100% concentration even at a  training
Be sensible to keep a good posture
Keep your tension even when reducing the amount of practices before races
Have a strong will to do it by yourself
I suppose it is great and these are not only for runners but for all of us
No hesitating to
Spam Mails
I received some spam mails on lang-8 consequently these days
These spam mails came from various women
I am not sure they actually are women, but at least woman's names
They ask me to send them an email
They don't have neither journal entries nor friends
Did you have similar mails

I loved the new route
The quake hit seriously some nuclear power plants in the northern Japan
There are serious damages there
It is now under serious emergency
Their core were overheated and melt down, so the experts have been working on it

It is exciting, very much exiting
I can't help waiting for it
Besides, we have to save electricity this summer, especially
There are many people sent to hospital with heat stroke so far
We have to take care of our health in this hot summer even without much electricity consumption
I watched a TV drama named \"Inspectors of Atami\" recorded in a HDD recorder
It is a drama series including 8 episodes
I watched an episode before the final yesterday
The main casts are Joe Odagiri, who is famous for a good looking actor, and Chiaki Kurihara, who played in \"Kill Bill\" as a crazy murderer
Some other good actors play in the drama as important supporting characters
The real criminal was not identified, but the mystery will be clarified soon
We had record heavy rain here and there in Japan
Trains were stopped and a lot of roads are closed to traffic
My daughter had to sit and wait in the stopped train for a long time on the way from high school
The typhoon caused serious damages to several areas in Japan
Some houses, many cars, and so on were swept away by the overflowed water
I appreciate you everyone for your corrections and comments on my journals
I am very grateful for your kindness, from bottom of my heart
I think that is why I can post journals everyday even if they are slight and not useful for anyone
Anyway, do you think we had better to request friends to someone who corrected our journals
But I can correct only Japanese post
What do you think about it
How is your place
To trim some branches of trees, to weed the garden, to mow the lawn, and to fertilize them with the chemical fertilizer
These were nicely done, and the garden got looked better
World cup soccer
The world cup soccer games is now held in South Africa
There was a game of Japan team against Cameroon late last night
Surprisingly, Japan team won the game
To tell the truth, I could not complete to watch the game on TV, I fell asleep at about the end of the 1st period
p) I am sorry that I could not watch the whole game in real time
This current Japan team is said to be not so strong as former ones
However, nevertheless, they won the first game
We, not only soccer fans, but also many Japanese people, are glad to hear the good news and will cheer the Japan national soccer team more than ever
Full moon and many thunders
I saw a full moon and many thunders at the same time last night
The full moon was in the southern sky and the thunders flashed far away in the northern sky many times
What a beautiful and funny summer night it was
The weather report said the state of atmosphere was not stable, so recordingly heavy rain fell in Hokkaido
But Kanto area, where we live in, we have very few rain these days
The plants in the pots are dried up
The unstability of the state of atmosphere shows the changing the season, I guess
My daughter and wife is quarreling now
It caused by a trivial thing
Such as, what time to wake her up, whether to make her lunch box, and so on
My daughter is annoying her injury on her shin
It prevent her from playing badminton at her school club activity
She is very nervous for it
This gives my wife the irrits at all
They started arguing and heated up
My wife got angry and mad at all
It is in a bad mood now
I wonder how I can reconcile them
What do you do for your old and unwanted clothes
We Japanese clean our house on the year-end
So did our family

So I have to bring them again this weekend
I got tired but I had a fruitful work
I will run Tokyo Marathon today
Breakfast, dressing, and so on, I gonna go now
I could not get up early as usual
Once, I got up, but I set an alarm and fell asleep again
The marathon in the summer burning heat made me worn out
My body needed enough sleep to recover last night
This is the excuse for getting up late this morning
It was my first time to go there
It takes about one and half hour to go there
Taking a local train, a super express for an hour, and driving a car for more than half an hour
I am wondering if I can get used to this commute
Started at 1pm on Saturday, ran laps in Hiratsuka Sougou Kouen Park, relayed among 7 members in our team, battled against the heat in the daytime and the sleepiness in the night, and at last finished at 1pm on Sunday with unmeasurable sensation
It was my first time to run the 24h relay, I was very excited and loved it
The committee includes representatives from some companies and works for about one year
We broke into some work groups to study issues
Surprisingly, I was appointed as a work group leader yesterday
It seems a big task
I think I will do my best
My wife I went shopping to Machida, where is a suburban city of Tokyo
It took about one hour by train from our home

It is certainly very good as expected
I will put on it for today's business trip

About a hundred of 5 to 10 centimeter cut of runners or stalks of vital lawn grass were planted on the dead area of them
After that, I water them a lot
I hope they will root and grow up soon
I wonder if it is so hot that they will be dried up
Well, the grass is a type of summer grass, so I guess they can grow up well, I'm sure
I love gardening even in hot summer
I can have a peaceful time
She becomes 71 years old
We will take the Shinkansen super express for about 3 hours
We love my brother and his wife
We wish they will have a very happy life forever
We are having a get-together at work tonight, so I didn't run but walk to work in 30min this morning
That's because I don't want to go the restaurant with my usual running gears on
When not running, It is too cold with them on enough to get a cold
I put on trousers, a knit, and a coat today unlike usual me
Excuse for today's overslept
I came home late last night from the business trip by packed train
It was very tough to take that much crowded train
It was so packed that I couldn't breeze well in the train
Is this an enough excuse for overslept today
He put some fishes into my tank, which were unfamiliar for me
This was a story in my dream several days ago

BTW, there is another one
My daughter will take the entrance examination to the high school of her choice in the week after next, too
They take the exam, not I
What can I do for them now as their father
To cheer them up, to take care of their conditions, 
no, it may be their own tasks
What I can do is only to be as usual
I went for cycling to Kamakura with my wife yesterday
This cycling is our annual event in Golden Week holiday

It is famous for very fresh seafood
visit to the shrine, Turugaoka Hachimangu
We could have a wonderful holiday
My LAN rooter has two networks
The PC and the printer were not in the same network, so the PC could not print any documents by the printer
I set them in the same one to make the PC recognize the printer on its network
One of my challenges finished
Straight days running finished finally
It was abnormally cold yesterday for a Spring day
Furthermore, It has been raining all the day
Thus, one of my challenge to run every single day at last
My record was the straight 123 days eventually
Another three days weekend
I will run 24 hour relay race at the Hiratsuka Park
We will compete in the distance how long we can run in 24 hour
It will be very fun
Actually I don't like to run soaking in the rain especially in early Spring
If I run in the warm season like Summer, I like running in the rain
Anyway, I prepared to get soaked during the marathon
Do you wear your wristwatch on when you go out for jogging or running
But I also felt free from the time, then
I have always ran while thinking how fast, how long time, how long mileage I run
Running must not be always an competition against someone
We can enjoy it more
We can enjoy just running, that is easier, more relaxed, as walking and hiking, for example
Put it off and leave it in your home, and go out for running
And then, you can probably feel very good
The Meteorological Agency announced the rainy season in wide area including Kanto was finished yesterday
I felt hotter and less humid yesterday than before
After working long overtime, I ran back home from my office for refreshing myself last night
New years days are seem to me as if they were yesterday
By the way, we should have a worth time every day and every month
My new months resolution is that I will write entries everyday on February
I am very sorry that my today's entry doesn't contain any contents
It seems just for declaration of my resolution
Which is correct, \"February begins\" or \"February starts\" 
To your family, to your friends ,to your neighbors, to your coworkers, to anyone, and so on
There are many people taking a morning walk or cycling
Most of them greet back, too
I feel happy to exchange morning greetings with warm smiles, don't you think so
I think It would be a nice day when I could exchange good greetings with people
I will go to the Yokota Air Base to run a marathon today
It's clear in the air
It's sunny in the sky
It's brightening and shining
It is her first date in her life
She went to the Tanabata Festival in Hiratsuka, which is one of popular festivals here
Well, this post is not about the date of Hikoboshi and Orihime, who are the couple of the Tanabata regend, but the one of my daughter and her boy friend
It took a long time for choosing clothes and for makeup
She asked me many times ifshe looked odd
Of course she looked very pretty for me

Do you remember of your first date
Of course it was my great sweet memory
Climbing Mt.Fuji, but couldn't finish 
My wife and I went climbing Mt
Fuji, but on the way, I felt bad and dizzy maybe because of the low blood sugar or high-altitude sickness
I had to go back after coming the seventh station
Difficulty of posting daily news
I decided to make everyday posts on the lang-8 journal at the beginning of this year as my new years resolution
But I found it very difficult to constantly post journals on every single day
At first, For what do I post
And I want to make friends with foreign people
The second, What do I post
The ordinary stuffs around me may be ordinary for me, but may not be ordinary for you especially in foreign countries
I always understand it
If I do it, I want to write interesting and useful journals, eh
Here
I could make today's post
I finished enjoying browsing boots which to buy, and decided to buy a good pair of boots at last
They are early Christmas present for myself
I ordered them at a shop on the web
I couldn't have found the same type of boots in stores nearby, so I ordered them at the web shop
I am slightly afraid that they will fit my feet
I think they can be fit because they are lace-to-toe boots
I am looking forward to receive them
A big and strong typhoon is coming
It is now near on the south of Japan on the Pacific Ocean and going north toward Japan very slow

We had an important meeting of our business yesterday
I could not wake up at usual time
anyway, TGIF

In Japanese, \"Ittekimasu\", which means \"I will leave home.\" and \"Tadaima\" : \"I just come back home
I ask your favor to tell me that
I also what to know those in other languages
Yesterday, I could complete the long distance ultra marathon
Fuji and beautiful lakes is great, many volunteers work for runners very kindly, and many local people in the area cheer very friendly and warmly
I ran this race for the second time, At the first time, last year, I had run 100km
It was very tough more than expected
But I got it
But it is even somewhat comfortable
We will discuss not only the team tasks and also individual tasks there
It is very important for us to do good jobs
I hope it will be a meaningful and worth meeting
I will make it
Did you make your new year's resolution in 2011
To be nicer to others around than before, especially to my wife
To put priorities not to myself but to others
I have to clarify the goal at first
To complete my first 112km ultra marathon on the end of April
I want to have friends of English speaker
Do I have some stresses
We enjoy running and viewing the beautiful sunset and the color changing of the sky to the dusk
We spoke various things while running
I am sure she is at the age of weight-conscious
Most women are sure to wish to lose weight, not at special age, but at all age
We have a fun time
I went to watch the Harry Potter movie yesterday
It was the last episode of the Harry Potter series
I enjoyed the movies of this series as well as Harry Potter books
The main characters grew up through the series in several years, the actors and actresses did, too
The last episode was interesting
But if you will go to see the movie, you had better to read the original work before going to the cinema
If you do that, you can enjoy much more
But it started raining late at night unfortunately
I could not run back home in the rain, so I took a train to home for about an hour
But I did not have usual cloth but only sports outfit for running, such as no sleeves and half pants
I took train with the outfits
So there were not many people in the train and at the stations
I felt ashamed, even I knew no one looked at me
I will dance at the year-end party of my devision tomorrow
It will be like a short performance of myself
I have to learn ,to keep in my memory, and to dance by myself in front of my colleagues at the party
I have some of not expensive pens
They cost not more than 10 dollars per each one
They are for casual use
I can write with them more smoothly than with ballpoint pens with the  viscous oil-based ink
I can use various beautiful colors of ink for fountain pens made by Mont
Blanc, Perikan, Sailor, and so on
The bottles of the inks are very beautiful, too
I enjoy writing with them at work and at home everyday
The last thing that I have to do is just only to write valuable things like articles, journals, essays, paintings, 
I like early morning in summer
It has distinct atmosphere, don't think so
Early birds are singing and the air is fresh before the sunrise
It seems to get hot today, but we can feel fresh in the early morning
The another hot day will begin today also
I am busy at work in these days
The monthly total of overtime was over 100hours in straight two months
I have to do many things on my job, to achieve many big and small goals
I have to do daily, weekly and monthly reports to my big bosses respectively
I feel time flies
My body feel sore here and there
And many other walking events are held in Japan
The Old and the young take part in the events and enjoy walking and the sceneries where we walk while walking
It was a very nice weather yesterday
Not so cold and hot, without chilly wind
We enjoyed walking in the rural area, orange field, riverside, oceanside, and so on
Those gave me some muscle sore
I make a habit to get up early and study English in the morning
However, I could not get up early these days
Even I wake up once, I get back to sleep again for about an hour
I want to get up early in my mind, but my body want to sleep more
It may be because I can't sleep well in the night
Well, It's all right
I don't think I have to blame myself for this oversleep
I want to rate all of them highly, but I can not do so, as you know
Some can be highly-rated, and others can not be
I feel sorry for them all the time
We came back home from Kobe right now
Japan National Team couldn't win the game with Paraguay yesterday
The game went into the penalty shoot outs and Japan lose in it, unfortunately
It has been growing very fast in these days
I couldn't cut them last weekend, so they have grown too high
I think I would cut them this weekend, but it's a pity that I can't do so due to the rain now
I should put off that till the next weekend
I start Lang-8
I'm student
Einlish is very hard
Japanese should wake up and recover identity to live humble and simple and withdrawing too much importing for food
So is my husband, Louis
★He said that Is it the world of SF
My boss said you must be today’s charge, well, they need to be able to talk politely
My boss said that you should plan if the content of the training didn’t change the basis
The bosses of this hotel were too strict with people newly, and a lot of new faces have left it so far
I wanted to make the training more cheerful and wanted to give new employees a good feeling, and I planned the training
My boss said that you should plan if the content of the training didn’t change the basis
By the way, the raining includes lingustic training
I'm not very good with one
Because only I have not lived abroad in all the employees
Therefore I have been study English, Russian, Korean, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese but they are imperfect knowledge
Next,I have to be fluent in Korea to use in a hotel
Thos are English which we practiced today
Anytime next week will be fine
Your room is 1230 on the 1277th floor
One in them said over laughing that it can’t be
Is it the world of SF
laugh also by another man it said
And a new employee said whether the hotel was in the space colony
I asked her what is so funny
One woman said that everybody who laughed in such a thing had low level of the brain
I thought that’s late to stop now 
Therefore,　I said I have more responsibility, but I get paid the same now
Then all new employees laghed again
However, I was serious a little bit.～～；
Maybe I think that I will apologize for having made it petty training to my boss
It is better not to be
【A so long episode】　P.S. So sorry, it is a too long sentence, it's all light only reading
I had been in a difficult situation all this week long
In my company, while I had gone to South Korea to take an official trip till yesterday, the problem was
I heard a problem for the first time yesterday
That is my boss A stage a workout and is not at our office any longer for three days
★The cause is because our company's a boss B decided to get fire his subordinatesr(=They are my colleagues
I asked me for my boss B after all because boss A was closed when I decided three people who made it restructure from your fellow workers
I declined it, and I was absent my job like boss A, too
My boss A was surprised to say that you have courage that you refused my request
Because boss B closed our company if even you who were calm were angry at me, boss B said that I forgave your the opinion
He became a severe look and was standing with a moment silence in front of me
The next day and I were invited to his room
He said to me,To that end,you must work of my instruction harder
Because of it,I did not give long national holiday of the May
So,I have been getting the National holiday of the taking the place since yesterday
Probably my character is cheerful, but I feel complicated for the problem unconsciously
I want be indespensable to our work place
I planing to go to Canada on business next week
But I go abroad, I suffer from jet lag on period of ※April and May
Even a Dr
didn't know the cause
If it is a Korean business trip, I do not make the worry near from our country to there
Maybe from now on, I am going to refuse the business trip
I am hesitating
Because I have never been to Canada
My comming back 1st time
It has been over one week that I do not sign in this corner, today I find that there is not any new friend visit here, perhaps I need spend more time on this platform, but how can I finish my works
My nickname \"Unicorner\" means \"the corner of you & I\", friends from all over the world are welcome to visit this corner and leave words
Usually students feel sleepy in the afternoon class, so the teacher asked us some interesting tests,

I don’t like online game, it has no good story, and all you need to do is beat the monsters again and again then it’s never end…
But many people enjoy that because they could make friends by beat boss monster or defend their castle together
It really provides good social function but just not what I’m looking for
If I’m serving on a jury, I will say that three remains were guilty, even the cabin boy as a volunteer to sacrifice himself, and even the cabin boy was the loser of their lottery game
Some people might said, the cabin boy just an orphan, and the remains have families, and the boy’s life made all three of them alive
But in my opinion, no one has power to decide other should be alive or die, if we consent to they were no choice to kill the cabin boy for living, does it means which we believe in human rights, such as all men are born with the natural right to life, could be breakable in special occasions
On last Tuesday, I felt tired from  morning, but I managed to go to the college

In contrast to my look, I'm arduous
Moreover, I tresured these days I do my best
I might be flying when I goal in
I'm confused means of them
For example, There is some sentence
It's very hot weather all day a long
I rode my bike and went along the sea
At last, I arrived \"A big zelkova\" in Galhwa
On my back way, I saw blue sky and green field when a sunset went down
That was beautiful I saw than ever
I thought that today is very special day
It's a long time
SO, I'm expecting to spend great time
At first, I buy some new clothes so that I attend my graduation ceremony
That is comes true
What I made me angry
I always enjoy borrowing some books
So I couldn't lend any books
It had very exhausted me
On my back way, I drop by the Academy Photoshop
I can't remind that I expressed the shop by English
There is the place which take a picture or sell some film
I had trouble taking my photographics 
because The shop owner let me waste my time
I hate to wait time
She said me, \" Please wait about 1 hours
As time goes by, She said me, \" Wait
some moment
She told me same thing over and over again
At last, I waited over time more than 30 min
She had better speak to me, \"Could you come back tomorrow
I can't stand wait for over time and tell a lie
I'll naver come again there
I studied TOEIC, but I don't know what sentence is correct
The cost would be compared\/ compable

However, answer is 'resistance

It's been for 4 years that I came to U

Tonight I saw the film version of \"The Phantom of Opera\" at home, which is played on TV for almost three hours
But its music is really fantastic, the leading actress' voice deeply appealed to me
Their beautiful voice have impressed me a lot, surely like a haunting melody in my mind
I was truly touched by the sentimental movie, especially when the phantom let Christine and Raoul go, I cannot help but shed my tears
I sympathize with the phantom a lot though he is sometimes too cruel, but I think it's the society that made him crazy
How solitude he was
It's a pity that he cannot bring his talent into full play
He is a genius
Well, since I will go to NY this summer vacation, I expect to go to Broadway for watching this show on the scene
Sometimes I may be confused when I am going to ask someone out for dining or accompany
Japanese is so charismatic and magical that can express what you want to say clearly but not so strongly
Through the language, I can relieve myself from the sense of unsafety in my interpersonal relationships
While I am exactly expecting to write in Japanese, I have found that I cannot type in Japanese in my computer
To polish my Japanese writing skills, it's time to download the software of typing in Japanese
And I have to do my homework
In the night, I will do a part time job
I'm a bakery
I will play with my friend this Sunday
Then I do a part time job too
I can't wait summer vacation
My summer vacation will start from September
I am looking forward to do all of them
I will go to Tokyo with my friends and go to the recreation with another friends
I have to do a part time job, because I don't have money very much
I want to do many things that I can do now while I am student

I said that this writing go on everyday, but I omit it right away・・・・lol
Well…today, the Japan was ringing with the osama bin laden
It was junior high school student that I have heard his name for the first time
Learning other language is a joyful thing
This situation writing some letters in English to here is a little step of the pleasure
The imagination that someone will fix my mistakes and wrong grammer make me so excited
I need to know a plenty of expressions and I believe these practices will give me many changes to getting some more
By the way, in Australia the heavy rain brought the flood, causing damage
Children is soooooooooooooooo cute T.T
I major art
Currently I got a part time job in child art institute
In Korean age is 4 to 10
I think the cutest age is 3 and 4 years old
They are more pureness and straightforwardness
Today in the morning, my face is puffy (a lot) because I drunk (heavily) last night
Then the cutest child came to me and looked at me for long time
And she tilted her head as if questioning this woman is who
And then she left silently
Yes, she scarcely recognized me
I went after her and asked her, who am I and how I look today
Her usually saying is “you’re pretty!” and I wanted to hear this word again
I want to deny my face is not puffy… so I want to deny I’m not ugly today…
But she silently said “you are
you look somnolently” (I didn’t open my eyes well because my eyes also puffy
so she thought that
I don’t write anymore
my eyes still puffy because of my tears
We are really nothing in the universe Part1
I didn't really know what to write about for my first Journal, so i decided to pick the first subject that came to my mind
Sometime  when I watch the sky during my daily walk to University I get this strange  feeling inside of me, it's like I'm getting sick of something
I don't really know how to describe the feeling, but it starts when I think about what lies beyond our solary system and how tiny we are
When I was a kid I always had an astronomy book in my hand, looking at picture of the Giant Jupiter, Saturn and all of her halos and learning about how universe in general without understanding the whole proportion and concept behind it
But since I saw the Ultra Deep Field, taked by the Hubble telescope, my vision of the universe totaly changed
The number of galaxies was so huge that I couldn't compare it to anything I knew
I'm going to post this journal in multiple parts, because I'm worried that it's going to be too long to correct
japanese culture
This year,in2010
I want to start to learn Japanese culture
For example,how to put kimono on
japanese tea,or japanese flower arrangement
Though I am Japanese, I don't know japanese culture well
My grandmother gave me some kimonos
but I don't know how to fold them
I want to enjoy japanese culture this year
I had no free time and I felt extremely bored, not just a moment, is all the day
I gave out most of the time for \"studying
Afternoon, I had to go school for the silly commencement exercises rehearsal
It just let us state in our sit and waiting
Nothing I had to do
In my feeling, waiting is worse than working
After the rehearsal, I thought it may go better
However, nothing was changing
I went to Tin Shui Wai for my Cantonese oral exam but I had waited again
When I arrived the exam site, I thought it will go very fast
Meanwhile, Icould go home and play basketball
Sadly, I waited one hour for the exam started and used about 45 minutes to finish my oral exam
Finally, it's easily to understand, I didn't have any time to do things that I wanted to do and I had been bored for a day
I had no idea that when will the weather become better
I also had to pick up my clothes on my body while going to school like yesterday
Now,I get worried and worried
I am worried that I cannot get the good results and I am afraid that I will have no exit if I make worst in this exam
As I am the last year examinee in 2010 HKCEE,I have no take two because the course will be change after the last HKCEE
Desperation is coming to me
I really don't know how to handle my desperated emotion,even if I make my effort for inhibit it
The devil is suffering me
Does anyone can helpme to run away from the hell
Liar game, which is a Japanese drama, is a interesting drama
If you haven't seen this drama, I suggest you to relish it as fast as you can
This drama is about the fight between intellect and intellect
And everyone in the game must lie to the other, and also not to be deceived by the other
There are many games in this drama and every games are the ordeal of intellect
Meanwhile, every games are the psychological warfares
Now, I had been watched season 1 & 2 of Liar games
And I'm looking forward to watch the movie of Liar game, the final stage too
Today was Friday
And I woke up at 7 o'clock in the morning and prepared to go to school
In the time of studing at school, it's very hard to go through
Most of the school time, I just continued writing and writing
Even I didn't have time for a rest
I had communicated and chatted with the foreign
I thought this was really a extremely good experience for me to improve my English level
Today was Monday, the first day to go in every week
But, first day is the hard day
Maths day
Since all of the day, I had used many time to practice and do Maths and A
I was very tired for calculate those difficult questions
After the school bell ringed, I really hope that I could back to home for a rest
However, the reality is always cruel
I must keep staying at school for making up a missed lesson in order to prepare the HKCEE
I was extremely tried today
Stop hidding!\", I told myself
Although I don't know if I am able to do it or not
Or maybe I will give up very soon
However, start from now, I told to myself that I must stop hidding
Just now, I have realize that I was hidding in my world of spirit
But I must stop hidding now
I must get out of this place, with brave
I have to be more confident to face the reality
Also, I should try my best to tackle the difficulties
I must come out of my little world which is simply inside my brain
Maybe keep staying in this world is a very great thing but I realize that is nothing help to me
Maybe I can still try to escape the reality, but now I really understand one thing, I must come out
I know, I know that prehaps I will give up and come back to my little world very soon, even worse
But whatever, everything must have a start
To say about friends, all of us will easily associate the persons who give you a room to express your emotions
Meanwhile, they're the persons who play with you, happy for your happy, sad for your sad
I don't know wheather I'm too intellective or I'm so ruthless
I want to know, I want to know that all
Maybe I'm just don't want to be too close to the other
Maybe my mind of self-protection is too strong
I can only ensure one thing, sometimes I simply want to be alone
That's a long time that I didn't online on my diary
Since there's a very big exam that I had to focus, I didn't have any time to do the other things
I can say that my exam is almost done because there is just oral exam only
In addition, I think I have to keep going on my online diary again
Keep training my English writing and make progress step by step
All of us choose to believe someone who we are near by and we share our secret to them, for the expression of our unbearable emotion
However, I choose to believe someone that I don't know
Someone who I'd ever seen, isn't very close to me
Since they are extremely close to me, I can't express all of my feelings and painful with them
I also can't share my secret to them, even through I want to say it loud
Whenever I'm facing them, I have to bear my desire of telling my secret
And my unbelievible feelings appear
In my mind, I'm pretty sure they'll tell the other after I tell my secret to them
It's so easy to imagine that they'll tell all the things to the classmates and thier friends, although I don't want anyone know it
So, I won't have any private in a short run
Base on the above reasons, someone that I have ever seen before and they're not very close to me is much better to believe
Since they're not know me, they're not study at school with me, I can express most of my feelings to them
I have no need to afraid that they'll tell the other because even if they do so, I won't be laughed by my classmates, friends for instance
Meanwhile, I can keep my own private
However, to be honest, I haven't believed someone completely
But we have to say, it's much better for you to express yourself to someone instead of friends, parents
etc, even if they're not faithful with you
PS: \"Someone is always better to believe
What's a bad day
Needless to say and no selection for me,I had to wear a lot of clothes and make my effort to keep my body warm before I went to school
Yes,I had act a snowman today
Actually,I didn't know and understand that why my school couldn't provide the warm water to all of the students after they had finish their physiologically need
Say it easily,it means that after you have pissed
Imagine that you have just finished pissing,when you are going to wash and clean your hands,you have to let the COLD water run through your hands
What's the 'great' feeling that is
The wind blowed my WET hands and I could feel my hands were shaking
Whatever,I know that I have to challenge the nature again tomorrow,even if I don't want to face it
I have to start my school life and face the reality again in this week
But unfortunately, it's not a good day
Although I was already used to do the heavy homework, I got a bad, bad prediction today
Since we were going to face the HKCEE, my teachers gave us a million of school work, and of course, also homework
However, today my English teacher told us that we had to stay after school for doing more and more exercises
So, you could imagine that how busy we would
To be honest, although I like studing English, I don't think this move can work
On the whole day, we are all exercising on different subjects
And you can understand it in ease, if you do too many similar works, just continue training and training, you will be very tried and you can't work up the enthusiasm
For these reasons, I think this action will just maltreat us and it can't make any help for our study
I want to study in the foreign
I hope to study in the other country, especially America or England
It's because in these countries' school, I can learn my favourite subjects such as philosophy and design
However, the most important thing is, I can learn the English by talking to the people there
I hate to be photoed
Topic: I hate to be photoed
And I hate to be photoed
However, there are always many people want to photo the other and I'm one of the victims
Even if they all know I don't want to be photoed, they ignore the situation
Yes, they ignore my feeling
Also, I cannot understand why I must cooperate with my classmates and take the photo together
Why I must take it
I can just feel that I'm in a jail
And my right, had been totally taken, even if just a small right

My occupation as private teacher started on December last year and I got the information about the vacancy from my friend, who also a private teacher too
On the first, I only had to teach a 3rd grade junior high school student who had to pass the national exam on April 2011
I was nervous on that day, because I didn't know why I was called, what topic that her mom want to talked, etc
And finally I came and we talked, she just asked me to come more often and also helped her to teach her 5th grade elementary school daughter and would arise my payment too
I came to their home not only for teaching but also be their friend
The exam had been passed and the result is very fantastic for me, for the beginner, for the newbie teacher
My first student is graduated with high score in Math and English, and my second student had her scores on report increased
From the previous experience in teaching, now I have some student

hello
I just joined lang-8
let me introduce myself here
I'm Jin, a 19-year-old man living in japan
I'm very lucky person
At first,I was in trouble
Many of my co-woker helped me to leran the new system 
They taught me kindly and speaking slowly
I'm very lucky person working with them.(or  I'm very lucky person to work with them
Because all of my co-worker is not Japanease
I said \"Thank you very much I'm very appreciate it 
But, I want to lean onother way
Are there any good word in English
Could somebady teach me

New Year's resolution
It's been 6 days since i returned from France
Nothing has changed here except that the visiblity is getting lower because of the sand traveling from the desert
I can even feel the sand between my teeth when i inhale
Which means, the sand storm is on the way
My English teacher once told me, an ambitious person only needs one resolution in his life while a person without ambition needs resolution every day
I just knew that i wasn't that kind of person with ambition
I don't even make a plan for a week let alone a life-time one
Live the life, make it simple
That's my philosophy which is also why i am now in the middle of nowhere,lol
I just wish things will be different in 2011, but i also know it will be just like other years
Things won't be different because you celebrated the last day with a bounch of unkown people drinking champagne
No new year's resolution for me, because i knew, i won't make it
Call me lazy, call me pessimist

Ashely is Korean famous family restaurant

This is my first entry to lang-8
My name  is yasu
I am urged to improve my writing, since I am having IELTS test next week
I took a mock test today, however, the result was terrible
I understood that the key to  advance it is simply writing a lot, making mistakes
Tough I can read many words, when it comes to writing it, I don't come up with them
To get high scores, it is crucial to use  more expressions than I have now as well as logical structure
I don't know how to use and make friends here in lang-8 well, as I have just registered
Anyway, I will submit now
How do you, people, think is there such a thing as the Russian soul
Some kind of a national character
I talked about it with foreigners twice
The first time it was a German guy, he had been seeing russian girl from Sankt-Pietersburg before our conversation, but they had broke down
But now although life is not as difficult, people are used to stay together to survive, and they don't feel themselves as independent as people of other nationalities do
Another conversation happened with Swedish guy, who is fond of Russia and whose dream is to immigrate here
We were talkind about different writers and he mentioned Bulgakov, I said Bulgakov is a Russion writer, he was surprised and asked me \"Really\", I answered \"OF COURSE
According to his opinion (and I agree with him) that feeling of superiority is very typical for Russians ( for example, OF COURSE all famous writers are Russians)))) but it is mixed with the feeling of insignificance of themselves -- such a paradox
That's just two features, two pieces of conversations I've had about \"Russian soul
my first \"hi-for-everybody\" here
Hi for everybody 
wanna write this first post about myself and my relationships with english
Firt time I got interested in it was when I studyed at school and joined an english study group
We read different english and american writers' books and discussed them from different points of view
Maugham, who is one of my favourite writers now
And there I read \"The catcher in the rye\" by J
Salinger in english (I had read it in  russian before and loved it very much
But I was complete fool in grammar then, so I couldn't express my thoughts the way I wanted it
Then, a few years later, I went to Germany by international exchange, there I had to communicate in english cause my german was even worse than my english, and my language barriere was broken there 
And the third point, I decided that the best way to learn something is to explain it to someone else
I started teaching young children and then adolscents english and finally got to know and learned something about english grammar
Prepositions and phrasal verbs - thats what driving me crasy now 
Last week, I made the panel for PC case with special tool (like picture
I used acrylic, LED, some connectors, and some electric parts
First, designing the panel with PC application
Next, cut the acrylic board with \"Auto cutting machine
And then, mount some LED and connectors
This is first time to write \" Lang -8
I'm DenDen in Japan
I want to learn English and to communicate with other persons
Living Japan

Eating ice-cream, photographing, spoking to good people
It's not be my diary
This school year I shall serious try to learn it

With love for comics

If I understood English well, I will be able to read many interesting books more than now
Or,I might be able to tell other people interesting point of Japanese
Those are why I learn English
 Valentine Day
It was a Valentain Day yesterday, so my child and I baked a chocolate cake
Of course we gave my husband a chocolate cake
At first I made
My summer is coming to the end
I will go back to school soon and I think it will be busy next term
I know i will start to learn French,which may be somewhat interesting anyway
But it was fine yesterday
Actually,I had tried to make cake before,but i never succeed
And when my girl asked me to do this with her,I thought i should try again anyway
Ice cream was not that complicated as we had imagined
We did have a rough time preparing for the cake
But guess what?The bottom was burnt,which really let me down
And what about the ice cream?I do not know
Hopefully,I will see what it is like from picture
Hope it will be better than the cake at least
Say hi to everybody
So just leave your message to me, than I'll add you to my friends
need more free to students! D
In Korea, most highschool students going home at 10 PM
so am I
There's no lesuire time on weekdays
I love watching dramas like Doctor Who, Sherlok, The Bigbang Theory
but I can watch these dramas on weekend only
It's horrible that restrain myself from watching dramas
and there are so many pressure about study
nobody loves study whole day
Many animals lost own habitat
Lately in Korea, Many environmental problems occured by Four River Project
the government said it will be helpful to Korea's economy
but many people didn't agree to government because it will be useless thing
the government insists that this project also makes tourist attraction, but it isn't
they destroyed famous place with great natural landscapes and also drived out many animals and plants from their habitat
the government didn't accept dissent of people because of their benefits
I want to many people in the world know about this and have interest more and more is this
I received 2 scam message in a week XD
Hi :) Have you ever received scam message in Lang-8

Social Networks make my world bigger
Lately, so many people are connected by social networks and messengers
so am I, I'm using Twitter, Facebook, Nateon and Skype :D
I think it's really worth to preserve what I did and what I'm thinking
and they are give many chances to make more relationships to me
it's funny to find different point between foreigners and me
sometimes many truth that I believed become lies
and also they give me knowledge about other countries that I didn't know before
literally they make my world bigger
Important of motivation
I found my old note which wrotedown some famous words by English
Maybe it is note of English subject
There are so many useful words like
The time when you think it's late is perpect time to do it.' and 'The man without motivation is not different from dead body
Anyway, after I saw this note I have some time to think about my motivation about why I'm studying English
It's really quiet simple
I'm studying English for play game which not translated to Korean
Although this is useless motivation, It was really important reason why I'm study English
Why did you started to learn other language
Before I started Lang-8 community
I just interested in English and Japanese
but since I started Lang-8 community
I wanna learn so many foreign languages
not only English and Japanese, but also French, Germany, some other languages
but it looks hard to learn these languages
so I decide to buy some language books after my exam has over
and I'll study some chinese character to read Japanese words
it's hard to read them 
need more study
My mid-term exams have done today
it was very hard time from wednesday to saturday

Even if I say \"我爱你\", it is an Italian speaking at that time
The Kannagi
I am watching the kannagi over PC
It is a story about the god in japan and a mere nymph-anime
I can't look up 美少女アニメ with English
I found it on the web and I'm watching it, and that it has tickers in Englsh and I can study English
I'm watching the kannagi which is found on the web, and that, it with English-tickers is useful for studying English
I'm wathching the kannagi is found on the web, and that, with English-tichkers is useful for studying English
Which is natural
It is so difficult that I can't translate the Japanese sentence into English one
I guess I use difficult grammars with Japanese or put away something for writing English
Nevertheless, languages are very difficult

We memorized a lot of English word and grammars at the school
We should learn how to express our thinking with simple English
The bus was almost fulled
I met a friend at Shinjyuku at first
it was the hottest day and I was lucky that the inside of art museum was cooler than outside
I felt relaxed to see many beautiful paintings taking a time
We had lunch Spanish restaurant near the museum as there were some people waiting for the tables at the restaurant in the museum
She has reserved the table in Izakaya
After eating, we went to Salsa lesson
I lately haven't practiced Salsa, but I enjoed it because there were nice people to lead me
I didn't drunk at all
I may be  strong to alcohol
I stayed with her place at night
I will talk about last Sunday(the next day
I check the mails and this site every day
I also like to read someone's ideas in daily life
Today I was wondering why I am taken up with reading diaries and correcting them
It happens to remind me
I was working in newspaper company
I was typing a lot of manuscripts after some jornalists wrote articles
Before publishing them, I had an advantage to read interesting news on the spot
So I love to read non fictions such as news,documents,life stories based on the real
I like to communicate with people ,not only talking with but also writting down ideas
I think it is easier to catch the personality and I am deeply affected by writting
In Japan,Japanese female like to think about blood type
There are some fortunetelling,such as palmreading,card reading,horoscope and so on
In your country, what is more populur about fortunetelling
I feel like a long way to talk with people in Spanish
When I practice Spanish,the words are not come out from my lips easily, insted of that,come up some english words soon
In my brain, it seems to be fulled up English and there are no capacity any more
I feel fool myself
Last Saturday, I went to eat out with my neighbers
We went to Japanese restaurant this time
We had one of typical Japanese seasonal dish(松茸土瓶蒸し
and Sasimi( raw fish), Crab,Tenpura and so on
I ate too much, but I believe that the total calorie is low
I am just thinking about breaking up
When people have to break up, what kind of things do they act
They are fighting ,swearng and arguing with each other
That kinds of things seem very unbearable
In my experience, I avoided fighting and swearing each other
 The case is not only man and female relationships but also friendsjps
Lately,I think I should have discussed the matter in details because I could let the person know what the problem was
I think it made the person more matured
Otherwise I would regrect that I didn't say anything
I go forward
Today  I had a tennis lesson in the morning
I usually have it every Tuesdays
I really like playing tennis with groups
I had two instructors,one is a man and the other is a woman
Feamale instructor is so nice and great
I appreciate her efforts to give me advices a lot
But male instructor is so strict
Please give me your addvice
More than 5years ago,I had a female friend  who lived and taught English to Japanese people
One day, I went to pick up her at her place
I thought she seems to be very tired
She suddenly said to me, My boyfriend dumped me
I was very supprised to hear that
She continued to say, we broke up
At that time I didn't say anything for her
I wish I had more English ability to encourage her, I would like you to correct this diary as usual
I also would ask all my Lang8 friends about it
Do you have some good expressions to give your friend who broke up with her boyfriend
My friend seemed very sleepy and she didn't seem to get up soon
I opened the curtain a little cause the room is dark and I didn't want to wake my friend up
I was reading the book for a while
And then she got up at last and toasted bread,made coffee for me
After having breakfast, We went to Ebisu( one of the city in Tokyo
The exbition was \"Look at me
Portrait photographs of nude.\" The photos were depicted various emmotions and relationships
First I thought there were many pohotographs which were depicted beautiful curves of figures of the object
I noticed there were many individuality or personality, kind of unique photographs in the exbition
It was nice experience for me
After seeing the art, we enjoyed the stage show which performed by amature musicians outside
How nice exploring in Tokyo
I finished to watch Japanese drama on Youtube today
The drama has 10 episodes
I started to see it from last Thursday, but I couldn't finish seeing all of them
I had other stuffs to do on weekends
I like Takizawa and Fukada who are Japanese actors
It doesn't cause any problem
I can be happy
I watched Japanese drama　流れ星 tonight
Today, the drama was climax and I was moved so much
So I desparately wanted to write my diary
Some girl was attempting suiside,another girl needs organ to be alive
Their lives are intertwined with( twisted around)each other
PS which is suitable expression
I happened to find this song, Yo ne se Manana, sung by Luis Enrique
Olympic games
Do you all watch Olympic games on TV or in Vanvouver
I watch it on TV
I was watching mogul games yesterday
I expected Japanese athelete 上村愛子 did her best
She did her great job,but unexpectedly,she was 4th rank
Actually,I am impressed by American skier  who gets the !st rank
She was perfect, She was very fast and performed beautifully
She showed us their dynamic movement
Bravo 
She deserves the gold medal 
I enjoy watching Prison Break Final on TV every Tuesdays
I usualy recorded it because the show is late to start
This tuesday, I forgot to record it
I am dissapointed with my forgetfulness
Today I had a chatting with my friend on skype
We sent messages each other on the real time
So I had some wrong spellings
I did wrong spellings a lot
Or I spelt a lot of  words wrongly
Or I typed wrong spellings a lot
Actually I  enjoy chatting with her and  I hope we had enough time to talk
Time diffrence is difficult to find the right time to talk each other
Yesterday I played tennis with some members  for about 7 hours
I have a little mascular pain on my body
Today is my relaxing time at home
In the program,it usually shows the great way to cook
It helps me a lot to cook for health and it takes only the short time
I like to cook delicious and healthy meels,not taking so long time
In the program, some guest like actor or actress come and have a chat
I like the situation as they show their actual face ,I think
I notice the colored leaves little by little
At the same time, I feel missing, somehow
Do you get the feeling like me
I saw the movie, the tytle is　魅せられて on cinema program on TV today
This is an American movie, but the location is Italy
The scene is beautiful
The actors are atttuctive and play the role great
I can't travel now, at least I enjoy seeing the movie in any locations
My allergy part 2
If I take some kind of medicine,my symptoms of allergy get well
But I feel dull,sluggish and sleepy which are side effects
That's the problem
I've heard vaccination is licenced in near future
I really expect that we can get it safely soon
I talk about my way to avoid the hottest days
I hooked on seeing the movies at home
I want to avoid the heat attack
So I lately see lots of movies at home daylight
When I am very moved by some sceans, I get gooss bumps and I can't stop my tears
It is no problem when I am seeing the movies alone at home, 
but it is embarransing for me to cry a lot in front of people at the movie theater
So I enjoy seeing the movies at home, I feel like leave me alone to focus on seeing the movies
Another way to avoid the hottest days, I enjoy reading books inside
Besides that,I have time to study English
That is great,isn't it
It is not so bad just to spend inside for a few months
I am patient to wait for Autumn
I would visit some places
Maybe I have a chance to walk around outside and I would visit some art museums in Tokyo and play temmis outside in my neighberhood
My friend always send me a lot of nice photos and told me some experience there
There are also some nice spots to go riding on bike
I want to visit her in my future
This summer was so hot, I avoided the strong sunlight daytime
I didn't get sunburned a lot
Japanese people usually say that Fall is the best for tasting seasonal foods and appreciating arts
I enjoy the both of them
After eating various foods, I know I should excersize more
I want to avoid to hold fat against the cold weather
I am tired of this hottest day
I like summer the best, but it is too hot doing outside
The other day, my friend emailed me that she would go to see the river side and swim there
I definetely wanted to join with her as I would avoid the hottest and I was bored just staying inside my house
He was a great driver in the narrow road headding the river
We found the nice spot where some people were already enjoying
When we were ready to go there changing the clothes in his car, some other people were leaving the spot
They already seemed to spend a lot
So we went there to soak ourselves, the situation is kind of owning the nice spot ourselves
The stream in the river is a little bit strong, so we just enjoy walking a little and soaking in the cold water
The cold water is comfortable to us
We didn't bring our swimming sandals,so we couldn't walk around because the basement was very slippery
I was very happy to talk with my friends seeing the blightening water splash
I had a lot of fun adventuring in the nature
I really like appreciating the nature
I'm happy because I like to cook the sesonal meal
After boiling chestnuts for a few minutes and peealed the skins
I made rice with some chestnuts seasoned with sweet sake, soysauce and salt
Before serving it, I sprincled のりand sesami & salt
栗ご飯is famous among Japanese people
It taseted fresh and good flavor
When I see the cherry blossoms, it reminds me the entrance ceremony
My farther took the photo of mine
I looked very proud smiling
My father gets older now
After his surgery, he gets better gradually and he enjoys meeting people and playing shougi(将棋)at the community center now
I was very excited to see new people and I was wondering how it was going in school life
High school life of mine is my most unforgettable one
I continue to talk about いきものがかりwho is a music band
When I listen to the lyrics of Yell, I get emotioned easily
Somehow I feel something,I can't express well,genuinely moved
Once I look for the songs on YouTube, I just can't stop
At least I suggest that everyone can practice Japanese with Karaoke on You Tube
I got the feeling that every skaters performed very well and they shawed their high techniques under all that pressures, many expectatons
I liked Miki andou's performance in the free skateing
I was moved to see Joannie Rochette' tears after the short skating
Mao Asada,the 19 year old captured the audience to complete a tripple axcel succcessfully
In her interview, it seemed that she was not satisfied with her free skating as she didn't it perfectly
I think she has got  a strong technique and she will challenge the competition again
Kim Yu Na is so strong to perform beautifully and perfectly
I like her perfoamnace in the short program
I haven't written a new entry because I had many things
Last month, I visited the art museum
I  had an appointment to visit there with my friend
I was late to arrive the museum because I was at a loss
Seeing the fine arts make me totally relaxed and it took me the old days
It also guided me some places I 've never been there, in  Europe
When I went to Paris, I didn't have a chance to visit surverb
I felt very romantic to see some paintings
Last sunday,I went to play tennis with some members
After a few hours, it's getting warm,and the sunlight became strong in the afternoon
Today was rainning and it was cold again
I think it is weird to have changeable weather here and there
The low of  nature is getting messed up 
I enjoy seeing cherry blossoms here and there now
I always drive my car to go out and I can naturally see beautiful cherry blossoms along the street in some places
We also enjoy seeing them in the parks,shrines,temples and bank along the river
There are cherry trees in line both side of the road, from the 甲府(Koufu)station all the way to takeda shrine
It seems a lot of cherry blossoms lead us to Takeda shrine
I will visit them and ask my mother to take a walk during this cherry blossom's season
The recipi of Japanese dish
Today, I talk about one of my favorite Japanese dishes
I have many favorote Japanese dishes
Although it it is difficult for me to choose only 1 recipe, I think this is a good one to bring to potluck party
Beef & Begetable Rolls
Salt & Pepper ( a little
Splead oil on the cooking sheet of oven plate
Bake for 20 minutes, occationally put soysause mixed mirin on 
and the taste comes into rolls very well
Serve them with tomatoes,lettuce or sliced cabbage
I hope you know or imagine this dish
It makes me happy to go out easily
I just wait for summer
I think spring is fresh and beggining in Japanese society
New grade is startng and new workers are joining the workplace
I feel like I get more energy this time of the year
Today I cooked {Boiled gut and liver of Chicken with soysause and suger
This dish is awarded by Japanese competition this year
This is original dish from Kofu city in Japan
I cooked it checking the recipe
I've cooked the similer one before, but it is the first time cook this one
The cooking way is very simple and it comes out deloicious
This dish is sustaining and nourishing meal
Olimpic Games 2
I was wondering if Kokubo ( Japanese snow boarder) performs very well
You may know it or not,he causes a lot of controversy in Japan because of some reasons
But he did his best and got the 8th place
I expect he is matured more and he has his future to challenge it next time
Aono ( Japanese boarder) also got the 9th place
They performed greatly although they had a lot of pressures there
My　dialy
It is the first time to write the dialy in this site
When i was a junior high student,I used to write my dialy in Japanese and I quit
After that,I sometimes write my dialy in English
It's instractive for me to memorize words
I think I am getting to used to speak English naturally little by little
I keep it up
Drama and movie
I lately hooked on watching drama and movie because i can watch them on cinema program on TV
I've got the trial from Hikaritv net
The trial system is only for 1 month
So I feel like I have to watch any program during this chance
At least,I get advantage to improve listening skill enjoying the movies
I noice that American movies have a lot of humor and Euroean and Azian movies have a great story line
My problem is that I can't stop wathing them
Moreover I have to be careful not to be fat staying in front of TV all the time
hooked on , addicted to , caught up in, Which is more common to use
Which is more natural to say
Some of my friends plan to go on a trip this end of year
I get envious, because I can't go traveling at this moment
One of my friends, she is planning to Australia
I wanna go there, I guess it is the middest of summer in Australia, the season is the oppsite of Japan
I like Summer the best,although we have to be careful not to get too much sunburned
Be careful not to get sunburned too much
He was a professional succer player
I rent the book because I like him very much and the book seems interesting, good material to learn new expressions
It seemed he wrote his mind in a natural way,straight forward
I admired his efforts and his potencial talents as a professional player
He played the succer match with his clever strategy
After his own decision to retire his career, he keeps his vision to encourage young player and children living in poor countries through playing succer
Nice to meet you, this is my fisrt entry and I hope to not make too many mistakes right from the beginning
The day after I will take an English exam, so I need to praticise a bit
Let me brifly introduce myself, firt
I'm studying English at University, not just because it's an important language to know, but also because I really like it
My main interests are cooking, travelling and listen to any kind of music, depending on my mood
I'm also interested in watching moto road racing, although I don't ride a bike
Currently I'm not doing any sport
But when I was small, I did a lot of them, like dancing, swimming, skiing, palying volley ball and tennis
Saddly, I had to quit bacause I didn't have enough time left to study
But now that I'm a University student I can start again
After becaming elementary school
It began to yearn for curly hair style, a cute girl who wear pierced earing
At that time, there are not many people who wear pierced earing even for adults around me
Of course I think nobody could not image that the guys became wear pierced earing like a Lady
Is that same as America
Even now it still do not see often the young girl wearing pierced earing in Japan
I think it is because of Japanese school rule
It seems are getting more mild from my school days but still have a \"school rule\" in Japan
Let me introduce \"What is a Japanese school rule for my school days?\" for next my diary
Hi everyone, I am really appreciate it you read my diary and your help
As you know we have a school uniform in Japan and also usually wear a T-shirt or a camisole under the uniform
But I had to be white color
It was not accept another color
Also we had a school shoes, everyone had to wearing exact shoes with a specified shocks
Which was must be all white color or one or two borderlines with white color
They checked out all of student every month…
Why did we have to be wear same things, have to be same hair style
But first I visited Paris myself for 2nights…to travel along was my first experience, feel was so lonely
It was not too bad more then I though, but always had to have foods along, did not able to share how much there are beautiful
After that, my friends joined my trip, it made me more fun
Have you been to travel your self
Did Japanese strict school rules made me a person with a half brain
I believe that I was learned how much important to have rules and follow a line to spend in many people with comfortable
After 16 years later, I could understand it…
Looking back, it is coming in useful for my common sense
However around time, I could not understand it
I wished if I were an American girl and I definitely wear in style cloths to school with stylish hair
From that time, it was started to have an interesting about America more than when I was young
You might have thought that I give up this diary after three days.(We called it Mikkabouzu:三日坊主 in Japan
But no~, actually I was taking weekend off
Today I will write some Japanese school rules when I was junior high school
It still make me a laughing at the memories.(LOL
Boys:clean-shaven head with maximum 7-8mm
I totally forgot exact number of length, but I am sure it was under 1cm
Girls:If you have a bangs, the length should be above the eyebrows
Also the length is your hair should be above your shoulders
Of course whatever you are boy or girl cannot have a hair color\/perm
Especially I had a long hair since I had a permission
my first diary
I have never written a English diary in my life, but I will try to keep writing and hope polish my English skills at this opportunity
Why I started to learn English

I am just staring to have interesting in America and thinking America is like my dream land

What did I have an interst about America
The fabulous gifts my aunt gave me was always so fantastic
All of them I had never seen in my life, like an animal design bed cover be glow by electronic and lighter, colorful bathing costume etc
I had only a  ugly dark color bathing costume as it called \"school swimming suit
When I was young as more than 20 years ago, in Japan there are not really cute any fashionable children clothes I think
So my colorful some clothes was always my boast
And also some pictures, she showed me was made me shock
they are living big house with fancy interiors
And another thing, the street in town was so wide
It's was when I was 4 or 5 years old, I had never seen some foreign moves
In the picture, people have different color eyes, hair and skin
so cute! like a doll that I used to play 
to be continue
クラスマッチ　is  like the sports festival

Today, I went for an outing to a kind of theme park with my family
Unexpectedly, there was Japanese Drum Show
The show was performed by Ondekoza
which is one of famous Japanese Drum performaner groups in japan
Anyway, It was nice to listen the drum sound outside
If you look at each Katakana, you can find alphabet which shows the pronunciation of the word
Then I was inspired by those fonts and created \"TREE\" font
without those help

I wish everyone spend happytime on the Valntine's day
I want to learn English because i need it to my future
I want to go to a country which its official language is English to learn and improve my English
There are \"five senses\" very important to me
This sense is always the pride of myself.(I noticed that my hand writing was uprising while I wrote this article on papers) My recent writing is pretty well, I hope I can keep it up, and the flowing inspirations are always there when I am writing lyrics
Although I'd like to call myself an \"English lover\", I know my attainment of English is hilarious, when it comes time to write
Dear Rachel, my friend of language exchange, what are you busy at recently
You haven't sent me email for a while, I can't help myself to feeling lonely
In the recent six months, I was fascinated by the world of rhythm
I joined a band to play Djembe and Cajon last month
The band name is kind of porno, so I think it is inappropriate to translate it to English here.(actually, I have no idea how to translate it.) Seems like cynicism, but the band members are very earnest and play very well
The worth mentioning thing is, beginning from the last week, something inspires me when I was practicing the hand drums, I played a lot of new patterns and good at flamenco all of sudden
I wouldn't say I have sense of rhythm, I still have a long long way to go, but my hands have started to feel something, it is delightful
continue
I know there is full of mistakes in this article, please feel free to tear this to shreds

It must be more than a year that I didn't practice my English
It sounds like an excuse but I spent most time in studying Japanese
But now when I want to speak(or write) in English, I found that I think the sentences in Japanese first
After coming back to Taiwan, I usually stay home all day because I am so lazy to go out
Now, if I have free time, I'll just go downstairs and spend not very long time doing some exercise

To learning foreign language is too difficult, but I study hard
I want to speak English and Spanish, of course Japnese
Hey, guys
I've noticed that being polite in English-speaking cultures is extremely important, whereas it's not so in Argentina
For instance, I've been told that saying \"What?\" when you haven't understood what somebody has just said is not good manners
Instead, you should say: \"I'm sorry, could you repeat that?\", \"Sorry, didn't quite catch that
My friends will come to Singapore

Now, Japanese often go to drink and eat with their company at the beneath of cherry blossoms in full bloom to enjoy the short-lived blooming more
Sometimes we can enjoy cherry blossoms  even at night because of light up
So from ancient age to now, Japanese seem become restless in this time

When anything does not meet his expectation, he will throw lots of vulgar words on you with his temper tantrum just like one of those kids
Suck it up:  Whatever the client does to me and no matter how hard the job is, I have to suck it up for my career, but when the client runs off the edge in common sense or moral to hurt me, I will not just let him violate my dignity
Actually, it happened few times
On the other hand, the crystallized intelligence will full of my head to make the ability of learning new thing harder, and I guess that is why some people are getting stubborn as they get older
Some older people like to suggest you something or tell you what to do and they believe that they are right because they have as similar experience as yours or have more life experience than you
When I was 10, there was no the internet, but nowadays, 10 years old children starts touching PCs and using the internet, so if they have their own PCs, or parents allow them to use, they can know something they do not know from the internet without adults' help
That is a big different with my life of \"10 years old
Many children can see so many things they are not supposed to see (at least, adults do not think they should) on the internet, and use e-mails, chatting tools or facebook, twitter, my space to contact with friends or make new friends
The internet makes things easier and the kind of habit does make young people lack the patience, because anything is going very fast and you have to get on the train to catch what happen around them
I miss the ordinary days that we had to wait for each other at a clear landmark to meet up, even if sometimes there were several McDonald around the station and made each other wait for 3 hours and went back to home with angry
Does full of the fluid intelligence not also mean that the brain is not developed enough
I really do not know about that, but the crime % of teenager is getting higher and higher
A 12 years old Japanese girl killed her best friend by cut off her throat because she felt her best friend hurted her so much by chatting
Someone says the crime does not increase but why people think it does is because people can receive so much information on the internet
Taiwanese are really into the star sign and even in interviews, some interviewers very care about candidates' star sign
However, Japanese do not really understand the logic of star sign because they believe the blood type is more concinvable than star sign
My blood type is O which belongs to people who are good at social and have open personality
My sign's personality is also very similar with my blood type, so basically, I am good at social and have lots of friends, but I am not
Everything has exception and I guess I am not counted in the stastistic of the star sign and blood type
I injured my back few times during I was 17 to 25 years old and that's why I started doing exercise to protect my back
Last week, I felt my back was back to the normal condition and I stretched and moved my body in very comfortable zoon
Well, maybe I was too excited on the beach, so I dived to the sky and fell on the sand beach and heaving ocean by a leaning back pose
I am sure the pose is not good for back
Please tell me how to stretch the body to increase the flexibility without injury
Because of my back's injury, I have gone to Chinese medicine clinic for a while
The Chinese massage is also one of their treatments
The difference between Chinese massage and other massages are Chinese one will make you beg the massage therapist to stop, because it is painful enough to make you scream
After the therapy, I felt like being violated, but it did help my body come back on the right rail
There is an option of the Chinese massage therapy
The Chinese name is 拔罐 and because I dont know how to explain it, I got this from Yahoo; \"the usage of vacuum cupping on a skin surface to create a suction to relief aching and soreness
I am sure about if readers will understand that
Anyway, after that, you will get BIG hickeys on where the vacuuming cups were
lol  If your blood circulation has a problem, those hickeys will stay on your body for 2 weeks, and it did happen on my situation
Pages of odd number will be your part and even number will be mine
I am tired enough because of the job and even don't have any energy to care anything
If your sales cannot reach the target this month, I am sure you will receive the ultimatum from your manager
Parents threanten children to do or not to do things by horror stories
I did not write dairies for almost a week because I was lazy.( I am not going to say BUSY) My previous English tutor told me that never use BUSY as the excuse to postpone something, because no matter how much busy you are, millions people will be busier than you such as presidents, CEOs, Famous and a lot of people
I went to the Chinese medicine hospital last Thu, helped my Japanese friend to find a sweet room on Fri, set up the internet and went to a darts bar with him on Sat, played the beach vollyball and fooled around with some new friends at a beautiful beach in the north Taiwan on Sunday
Last Friday, a Japanese friend of mine came to Taiwan for a business trip and I took him out to gp tp a dim sum restaurant in Taipei city
We had the dinner with 2 other people who were a Japanese guy and a Taiwanese girl
or arrowing buddy?) and as the time goes by, I realized the Japanese guy and me both are working for the same industry and have a few mutual friends
He quit his job which he had spent 4 years to study abroad in Taiwan to improve his competitiveness which, by the way, was the same reason why I came to Taiwan
That was a huge surprize for me but I was not close enough to him to ask him for a big favor to introduce me to his previous company, so I did not do any action about that
However, this information did help me to get a chance to contact the representative of the company's the US' branch office
The story was there is a purchasing manager of a big retail chain store in Japan and he came to Taiwan for an interview and a short trip just few days ago and I am familiar with that company he interviewed with, because that company used to ask me for the position but I rejected in very peaceful way
He came to Taiwan with his friend who works for the same company with the darts-buddy guy, (let's use AAA instead of this company) so after I finished some crap greetings, I asked the purchasing manager if he had any job information in the US
As above, I already knew AAA is looking for someone for the branch office in the US, so when the purchasing manager answered me that he did not any of them, I asked him that \"is there any chance AAA is seeking someone for that?\",  Just as my expectation, he asked his friend about the job for me and the end of the day, the representative of USA branch office e-mailed me
Well, let's back to last Friday
I heard someone screamed my name as I just stepped into the bar and saw a woman was waving her right hand against to me
She was one of my classmates of ballroom dance class ( Yes, I went there and suited tight fitting pants and shirt) and we had not met each other for almost a year
One of my friends just gave  the information that a Japanese company is looking for a candidate who has the experience in the industry and can speak fluently Japanese and move to the US
I am not going to say I am the guy but it is kind of suitable for me
It will be a big change If I can nail it and I really hope I can, because I have been hunger to get a job in the US
I realize that sometimes, whatever skills or abilities you have, it cannot be stronger than connections or pulls
Bike
I bought a bike at Sep 10th's night, and I have already riden it for over 450km
My goal is at least 1,200km every month which means I have to ride for 40km per day in average
Well, it's really short for biking but when it becomes to daily routine work, it will not be that easy
The brand of my bike is Giant
I guess it is not that popular in the US
The most famous brands of road bike in the world will be COLNAGO, BIANCHI, De Rosa, Cineli and Pinarello
Top class bike of those brands will cost you minimum 10,000 US dollar
How much my bike was
Make a guess
The cost of race horse is almost twenty billion won(korean money unit
On the other hand, general horses' price is about twenty million won
Probably many people think this is not special story
The story is not end
The owner of horses have to select strong, ability horse and make him to be race hores
In order to be a race horse, he nees parents who were race horse
And, he have to pass the test
The owner lock horses in a fense
Horses can eat lots of plants but they cannot drink water
7 days later, the owner open the door fense and allow horses go to the pond
Probably horses feel really thirsty
In that moment, the owner rase the flag
It means stop sign
Almost of horse don't stop to drink
But one or more of them stop to drink
Finally, the owner select the horse who stop to drink as a race horse
It's very impressed to me
If I want to be a grate person, I have to be a patient person
Last night, I saw him in dream
I dont know why he appear in my dream
It's not pleasure to me
Anyway, the TEPS score appeared on TEPS hompage
my score was 548 point
It's nessasery to take a 'University English Class' that TEPS score should be over 550 point
So I believe my score will rise up next month
These days, I have a lot of anxiety
I mean I', full of cares
I don't know what can I do for my future
Maybe, I have lost my passion after the point that I enter the university
The time which is given to me is too pity to waste undet the influence of passing emotion
Remember your forgoten dream, and don't forget your shiny dream
I quit a job a week ago
They also use FACE BOOK so it is really easy to contact them

This afternoon I was visited to be a referee of the basketball game，which is hold by my school
I think I was fairly to both teams as possible as I can
however, There was a student whose team was lost the game always to be foul-mouthed
I was so angry with him
But I didn't know how to deal whit that
Please correct my mistake
①my greatest moment as a student
One day, although I had a plan to hang out with my friends, Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, Professor Anderson gave me some homework; to make one million sentences in English
About that time, they both were really busy with the filming of \"Pirates of the Caribbean
So it was the only chance to go out with both together
I am still proud of the moment I decided to do so
②my worst moment as a student
My worst moment as a student was the flash of cheating with Kleenex
It was a really awesome method
This mainly works sometime after a few people have turned in their exams
So during an exam make like you are sick; cough, gag, blow your nose, basically do anything to give you an excuse to get up and take a tissue from the teacher's desk
But while you're up there sneak a peek of the tests people already handed in
Remember what you saw and write what someone else already wrote, but be sure to footnote
③myr most memorable moment as a student
The first class in the Metropolitan college was the best moment meeting
At first, I met the wonderful and very intelligent teachers
Then, I met the generous and fantastic friends
I cannot thank you enough for the meeting
④my most embarrassing moment as a student
It was when we made speech about great leaders
Although I chose MLK,Jr., Martin Luther King, Jr., I called him Martin LUCAS King, Jr
Here is a message what I send to people on Lang-8

On the first day of consecutive holidays, at the foot of Tokyo tower, the sauries given from Ofunato, in Iwate prefecture, were treated a lot of people, especially families
Although we were doutful about it would been held because the earthquake devastated Ofunato, which is the place for shipment, but it was held in some way and 3,333 flesh sauries were treated
People who ate the fish meal said, : \" Yam!\", \"Even the organs are good
The visitors seemed they were enjoying the season of the pleasures, \"a charbroiled saury\" or \"a soup of ground saury flesh
thank you in advance, Mami
This cuisine is very popular in Japan, especially in Kansai region
The name is derived from the word \"Okonomi,\" meaning \"As-you-like-it\", and \"Yaki\" meaning \"grilled
The name originated from \"As-you-like-it\", basically meaning that we can mix in whatever we like
At first, we need to prepare the flour, water, oil, an egg, and shredded cabbage
To be frank, any kind of Okonomiyaki can be made using only these ingredients
However, as you may have imagined, using only these five things does not make Okonomiyaki tasty
We must add some other of our favorite ingredients
We can add whatever we want, corn, cheese, or sausage, etc 
But traditionally, we add bacon, which is cut into about 8cm pieces, green onions, which should be thinly sliced diagonally, Tenkasu which is Tempura bits, and Beni Shoga, which is pickled ginger
Secondly, in a large bowl, we whisk flour and water together until it becomes smooth
Then, we add other things and mix them all together, be sure not to over mix to insure you won’t get tired
Thirdly, pour oil over a griddle that has been heated to 200 degrees and put the Okonomiyaki mixture on it, as if making a pancake, until the mixture is around 1.5cm thick and approximately 30cm across
Then we add the bacon pieces to cover the top of the pancake
Please don't forget that you have to eat quickly or else someone near you will take your portion

We are affected by big earthquake
I was in Shinjuku, a little far from epicenter
however all the trains are stopped and many peole were stuck
Even if we were in such a big trouble, when I went to convenience-store to buy food that night, people faithfully picked up goods scattered by earthquake, stand in a checkline in neat rows, and they gave their turn to elders
I am university student and major engineering, specially fluid dynamics
Next year I will start working global automaker

I am not get used to driving, so I was very tired when I arrived at the shopping center
I met my sister aroud 11:30 and we had lunch together at one of the restaurants in the shopping center
A cleark brought some kinds of breads to our table, and we could take as much as we could
However the taste was not good, so I didn't eat a lot
After eating lunch, we did shopping at a market
I bought some groceries and headed back home soon
Because, the parking free fee was only two hours
I didn't want to pay extra parking fee
I feel really sorry to them
I wish the situation gets better as soon as possible and the people who are evacuated from Fukushima and so on can go home safely in the near future
I've never spent such a boring holiday like this one
I get up early,running,having breakfast,spending the whole day at home,and then go to sleep
Before the exam Gaokao,I began to talk with my classmates about what kind of computer games we were to play,and where we were going on holiday
But out of our expectation,the holiday is so boring that we all alomost stay at home for the whole day
I've been waiting for the game World of Warcraft,which is surrogated by Netease, for almost a month
And now I almost lose my interest
My parents asked me to read more books to open my mind,but as most Chinese know,students that just having finished Gaokao is no willing to engaged in any books
And this phenomenon results from the education mode in China
For now, I haven't slept for two days and three nights, struggling with my project, which is due in a couple of days
Sometimes I was just wondering whether I'd got a good timing
I've heard that people can make it through their tough work even with 8 hours long sleeping time and extra time for playing games and stuff

Even now it's more than 35 degree everyday
The scenery from summit was awesome 
It was like a different world to my town (everyday 35 degree
Do u know this mean
We could see great starry sky at night in there
I could count shooting star 20 more just in 1 hours
So,this trip was one of my summer's high light
Let's go into the nature
Let me express those
I mean the city is Tenjin
The foods are famous for Tonkotsu(pig bones) Ramen, Mizutaki(a chicken hot pot) and
Someone is walking, running, cycling, skating or paddling a pedal boat
I always saw happy-looking family there and relaxed
Halfway down the path I used to go to an art museum
At that time, I'll go to the island, Nokonoshima, that I've wanted to go
I love their body color because their color is cute
I think those colors depend on foods is really fantastic
I think the true fascination is that color is flamingo pink and not pink
Speaking of which, I've thought the color of pistachio is pistachio green as well as pink flamingos
I read that a design company decides color and texture from leaves, stones
Those were in a wooden box separated small rooms
And then I yarned for this color pallet
Both of them attract the attention of not only contemporary art but also the architecture
This project consists of old houses which were renewed as installation art by artists
Minamidera\", one of them, was an exciting interactive work and reminds me of the emotion even now
When you listen to your favorite music, your brain release dopamine
In detail, when you're excited or thrilled to that music
When I read that, \"I Want You Back\", \"Stop The Love You Save\" and \"Can You Feel It\" came quickly to mind
Because recently I was addicted to the movie \"This Is It
When I hear just the introduction of these music, I can't resist grinning
It's the happy moment
Because I read the novel \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" (Milan Kundera) and the novel has become my favorite novel
I have more books to want to read
This night's mashed potatoes were delicious
I've heard the name of the band and known the CD jacket which is a picture that a baby boy in the pool
I wasn't interested in them, however, I've been listening to their music finally
I've gotten bogged down in their music and I got to know the song \"The Man Who Sold The World\" Nirvana played
I've heard his name and I've never listened to his music
But now I've known his beautiful voice thanks to Nirvana
Recently I knew their exciting song \"Under Pressure
And then the song was a collaboration with Queen and David Bowie
And another is kiwi
As for kiwi, a coat is cute and a cross-section is attractive
At first I thought it was not enough acid, but I became fascinated with its feature that it is always sweet
I've yearned for going to the island for ages
This island is famous for an art island
At first, I went to the Chichu museum
I felt holy atmosphere in \"Time\/Timeless\/No Time\", Walter De Maria's work
And I was thrilled by the short way between the museum and the museum's ticket center
I've expected what was waiting in the museum along the short way
Their art work is my type
The song which I listened to first time was \"KIDS
When I heard the intro first 10 seconds, I've been already excited
Their music gives me thrill and glitter(I can't express 'わくわく' and 'きらきら' in English
Or it might invoke my childish like kindergarten
I found out the song \"Only A Shadow\" from their cover
I couldn't believe the song wasn't the latest one
I'm interested in MGMT's cover too

However, I do not trust the first impression I felt and throw away it 
I watch a person closely  since the second times

As for the Prime Minister in recent Japan, the number of Tokyo University's graduates has decreased
Why?(Tokyo university's examination is  most difficult in Japan and it is a top university in Japan

The sunsine in autumn is gentle and heavenly, and it reflects the colors of leaves
So, the fields of Japan sometimes sparkle vaguly
That seanary is a Japanese valuable thing

I thought that my first post in this site could be an introduction about my family
I might be a little bit spoiled and intolerant at times
If I would have a younger brother or sister I can say that it would take me a long time to adapt since I don't really know how to share and be tolerant
My father lives in other city with another woman
My father visits me few times a year and in summers I sometimes stay a week or two at my grandparent's house (my father lives in that city as well), though this year I didn't visit them

I sometimes pass them, for example Takuya Kimura, member of SMAP that most popular singer group in Japan, and Hideki Takahashi who's popular actor of Japanese costume drama, and so on

The red ribbon is an international symbol of AIDS awareness that is worn by people all year round and particularly around World AIDS Day to demonstrate care and concern about HIV and AIDS, and to remind others of the need for their support and commitment

I mentioned my recent attitude towards the life in the lab in my last diary
And then, several friends enlightened me and gave  me some advices
The students in most labs have been accustomed to the life--eating meals,noon break,surfing the internet,reading papers and doing experiments in the labs, and so on
I am a newcomer and I have accepted this lifestyle and the pace of life furthest
Even though I do't like it very much, I'll still be giving it my bestest to  accommodate it
When it's dark, another newcomer and I go for a walk after supper
It is the only motion for us at present because of the high temperature
Now I must read a lot of papers since it's impassable for the late research and I am woking hard
I came back
My winter holiday has been over
The spring festival was wonderful
It is the time 
Kangmei is one of my roommates in Jiangsu University
She comes from Shijiazhuang,Hebei Province
I call her Kangkang and she call me KK which is short for Kilo Kiol
In my mind, she is not only  clever,ambitious and highly appreciative, but also has wide range of studies
She has read  innumerable books and we ofen discuss the content about some of those we are both intrested in
She prepared for the examnations last whole year because she planed to further study in the USA
Actually, she received two offers because of her experiences and the scores she got in the GRE and TOEFL while both schools did not offer enough scholarship
As a result, she chose to get the master degree in the previous university
Today I gave a news report about the weather on Mid-Autumn Festival in our English class
Our topic is Typhoon Fanapi's impact on Mid-Autumn Festival
The 11th Typhoon Fanapi is the first major storm to strike the land this year
And it has hit Zhangzhou county in Fujian province
The friend mentioned in last diary is Zhang Xiaomin
The place  where I met with her is the English Square
Afterwards, I always see her in other places,in spite of she don't know me
She introduced the site to me 
And she also learnes English and Japanese in the site
Though she is one year younger than me, we have a lot in common that is beyond my classmates
I still remembered the sight we spent the whole afternon to have a chat in the sunshine in my courtyard
The topics were always one by one so that she forgot to go home to have supper, which made her grandmother angry often
It is regrettable that the chances we talk face to face are fewer and fewer
We attend school in different city,but it does not produce an effect on the friendship between us
I still remembered the particular day-August 8th,2008
The 29th Olympic Games were held in Beijing,China
People from all around the world  watched  the opening ceremony bird's nest-National Indoor Stadium on that night
Our Chinese had  looked forward to the day for so many years
It was bound to be a wakeful night
You won't make friends staying home alone
Join a club or group, talking with those who like the same things as you do is much easier
Or join someone  in some activity
After all, meeting strangers means seeing the unknows
And it's human nature to feel a bit uncomfortable about the unknow
Most of our fears about dealing with new people come from doubts about ourselvse
We imagine other people are judging us too tall or too short, too this or to that
But don't forget that they must be feeling the same way
Try to accept yourself as you are, and try to put the other person at ease
You'll both feel comfortable
Try to act self-confidently even as you don't feel that way when you enter a room full of strangers, such as a new classroom, walk tall and straight, look directly at other people and smile
Don't wait for other person to start a conversation
Friendship is based on mutual liking and \"give and take
And there are things that keep a new friendship from growing
He and I lived in a village ,but the  clear memory about him went back to Grade Three in our primary school
He always studyies hard wherever ,whenever
Now he is working hard at Engineering Soil and Rock Behavior for a master's degree
At the same time,he is preparing for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL
We often have a chat,communicating recent studying and the trifles in daily life
The friendship between us is beyond all comparison and doubt
When I was low-spirited or in bad condition, his encouragement made me refreshed
It is my honor that I have such a distinctive friend
My friend was so kind and he taught me how to hold the rackets and how to bat the ball with unglagging patience
when the ball skipped the table,you must knock back the ball and the ball must be landed on the table,too
And so did your partner
Our major is biotechnology and we both love the life science
Now I am his master because of teaching him how to bename a net identity
Actually we are good friends instead of the \"master-pupil\"ralationship
He is one of my friends who have influenced me profoundly
In spite of having graduated from our university for a mouth,we  keep in touch often
This is a beautiful poem on sorrowful heart
And I adore roll-skating
Roller-skating is an adventurous,exciting,mad-brained sport
I have learned it for almost four years
I cannot recall the times I fell to the ground
The shoes,roller skates ,take me 450 RMB which is  practically equivalent to living expenses for a month
Now I still admire one who is highly skilled at roller-skating
It is a part of both memory and life
I have come to my university for a month
During this period ,I made progress a lot in English
The mixed feeling was extremely subtle-exciting,interesting and happy
I am accustomed to keeping some diaries,listening to Yale's open courses, memorizing words and common sentences everyday
I don't need to take a lot of time, instead I spare small pieces of time on those
At the same time, I am aware of the fact that how lucky I am
I have both external conditions and internal conditions
Not all the people have the atmosphere and can concentrate their efforts on learning English
Huamn capital has high rate of return and affects the economy in spite of the obvious imblance between human capital and physical capital China
And it also improves the adaptabitity and allocative efficiency and other relevent benefits
However, due to the low support for education, one's birth place and hukou policy,under-investment and insufficient geographical distribution of human investment,acess to education is not equal
As a result,the rate of return to education is low
A number of policies will foster human capital and promote economicgrowth, such assubsidizing education and increase enrollents, opening market and eliminating regional disparity in wages,equalizating regional and urban return by permitting free capital and labor mobility, centralizing educational finance
Even though these policies mentioned above don't reduce the inequality temporarily,in the long run,in a word, increase in human capital will reduce inequality and help the economic growth in china because it can helps enhance skills and equalize resourses
Whatever we do, we must have sound bodies because good health is the foundation for us to fulfill our task
An experienced medical professor may well have profound knowledge in his field
But if he is in poor health, it is impossible for him to pass on all his knowledge to his students
There are diverse ways to keep fit
clear air and clean water, nutritious food, moderate activities, say, a short walk in the sunshine, a fifteen-minute aerobics indoors, or just a pleasant nap without worries of business in mind
What really counts is that you will never give it up and make it a part of your life
love is when you feel like you are the two around 
When I was an undergraduate, I read a brochure which was called \"what is life?\"written by Erwin Schroedinger,a famous physical scientist
He tried to described the essence of life from a perspective of  quantum mechanics
Of course,with the development of science,some of his viewpoints have been out-of-date or one-sided

That cannot be denied we have a hard work
Yesterday was the twenty 3rd World AIDS Day
Started on 1st December 1988, World AIDS Day is about raising money, increasing awareness, fighting prejudice and improving education
World AIDS Day is important for reminding people that HIV has not gone away, and that there are many things still to be done

I think I am getting to find \"the good feeling\" inside me
It seems easy to convert the feeling to the opposite one when I have recovered the orginal positive mind
But, It was not easy to think about what is the good feeling when I was under the negative  mood
I think there is a kind of horizon between our positve mind and negative one
It's like  our hand
It has both sides
if you want either of them, All you have to do is choose one  You can turn your hand in the direction you want
It means that to change the side is easy
In this way, you can choose your side of your feeling
If you select one- I hope that will be a positive side, you have to maintain that feeling on purpose for the time being
And then, the feeling will  cover you very slowly
Remember it will never drag yourself alone into the dark, but the poeple around you
In the book \" secret\", the world is made of the things that you have thought before
If you think someting positive, it will come true before yourself

Culture smart or science intelligent
First ,let’s give a definition to both culture and science
Culture means the customs and beliefs, art,way of life and social organization of a particular country or group
While science means knowledge about the structure and behaviour at the natural and physical world, based on facts that you can prove, for example by experiments
Based on the definition we can say that culture is something abstract,the science is something specific
Beliefs , arts,customs are all a part of culture, it’s hard to tell what excatly they 
But science is quite different ,it is something made from the natural and physical world
We all can tell what it is and how does it made of
Culture is something connected with our inner heart , it is the creation of the human soul 
Sculpture,painting create the space; Something like music grasps the time
Due to psychological’s experiment and identification, inner world is related to the material world,, and the soul is the origin of the world
Can you imange a high developed material world without cultural civilization
In recent years ,dichlorvos ham,,melamine milk, fake diplomas,various of incidents occur frequently
What contributes to these, because of our underdevelopment of economy
Our carelessness towards fellow human results in it
Maybe someone will argue that we’re developing country, we have to do so for economic development
Bu let’s look at our neighbors india and vietnam, are they more developed than us, obviously it’s not
Indian pharmaceutical exports is among the world’s strongest and most powerful
We need more love, introspection and respection for others
But a world without culture is more terrible

Yesterday, I had a party with my neighbers
Three people are living in our apertment, and we sometimes have dinner together, or talk over a cup of coffee
I'm going to move out in three weeks; it was a kind of farewell party 
We were not going to have the party, but we quickly decided to do because everyone were at home yesterday --which was rare --- and we were not sure when all the people can get together next time
Althought we only had 30 min to cook,  the dinner turned out to be really gorgeous 
I whip up \"baked potato chikin \" and Chinese radish salada\" 
As well as we enjoy dinner, we had a meaningful discussion
Bible was the topic
They suggested that I should read bible in order to get knowledge about christianity and learn the idea of western people
I think it would be good for my study of English language

to be or not
many times I wake up from my dreams and remember the pain that I’ve got not only for the stress for my work but also the life I’ve countered with
What kind of man I wanna to be also confused me
I’M NOT REALISTIC and have so many dreams to carry and finally I’ve grabbed nothing in my hand
what a poor man
TO be or not should return to my mind again decisions should be made at once
And also the love is not come for me, my mother'd intruded a boy to me and I’ve find he was not sincerity to the love but just like the game hunter and touted my heart
OMG PUT YOUR MERCY SHINE ON ME PLZ
The end of 2005, firstly I went to the Vietnam with my friends
During the 1 month, I studied Vietnamese at Vietnamese Language School in 
At that time, I've been interested about learning Vietnamese 
because I was majoring Vietnamese
Moreover, all of professors are kind and nice
During the weekend, I and my friends visited many famous places and ate Vietnam traditional food in Ho Chi Minh city
Vietnamese generally drives a motocycle
After we have seen numerous bikes in the road, when we crossed the street, feel scared
As days go by, we got used to walk the street, fortunately
I am very excited and outgoing in Vietnam
I even feel it's like my heaven
I made Vietnamses friends, they introdued famous restaurants and markets in the city
I had the opportunity to practice my Vietnamese to Vietnam People
After 1 month in Vietnam, We began with 1 month backpack trip
we went to the Ankor-Wat in Cambodia by bus except for main city of vietnam
Because length of Vietnam territory (from South to North)is 1,740km, we took the long time to move around there
But we experienced various culture of Vietnam
It's a real Vietnam
As a result,although Backpacking was pretty tough, It's really fun
Last Year, the end of the March, I went to the Hanoi in Vietnam again as a intern
I had a no problems to get used to Vietnam anymore
But I didn't use Vietnamese for a while, most of it I forgot
My office is located next to Daewoo Hanoi Hotel
It's little long distance by walk, from my home
Sadly, I was very busy when I stay in Hanoi, I can't have enough time to trip near city
But, I had a chance to go vacation during the national holidays of Vietnam
I remember it's a Anniversary of Vietnam War.)  
I like the bus trip
I'm very difficult to speak English comfortably
I continuosly think I don't give up about speaking English anymore
Consequently, I think that experience of Vietnam was made me grower and grower
I always try to thanks to my everything
Thanks for hearing me
I am working in the office
Fortunately, I just finished my task
Because I am a intern, I sometimes have enough time surfing the Internet
I'm very scared the situation after my internship 
I want to make my mother happier than now
I wanna be a proud lady
Although present is not changed, I will change my future
Why can't I speak in English spontaneously
I'm having stressful days recently
The problem is that I cannot speak in English than I thought
I didn't expect so much like reaching for the sky
When I try to start speaking, a flood of same kind of words come up to me in disorder
I usually image in my head what I am going to say, then try to express it in English
Is this basically wrong for an intermediate-level 
Japanese at first, then translate it into English
On the contrary,to write sentences is a little bit easier for me than to speak in English, even if it is in above-mentioned style
Last night kids playing around the room until midnight
I know I should have force them to go to bed earlier, but actually we had had a power nap in the early evening,so I let them be free
This morning the person living on the floor below us came and claimed that our children made too much noise when they walk around
There is no doubt about it, but I think that was our first time to make them annoyed
After all we've just moved here a couple of weeks before,and every weekends we go back to our second house
this condominium's structure, the noises like TV,radio or voices are blocked
We'll try to keep quiet when we walk in the room,but I have no idea we can manage it all the time
You know, 6 years and 3 years kids go wild sometimes
I don't know well how to use this, but wanted to try this from my curiosity
If someone kindly correct my mistakes in these sentences, I would be very happy
He weighed 2700kg
Now I feel greatly relieved as everything went through safely in the end
I'm sorry for having troubled you as I could not support my daughter during pregnancy
When we take food, it knocks down the germs or viruses contained in food before digested and softens food for digestible
In this point of view, we should try to keep food in our mouth as long as we can
From August 12 to August 14,we hold Bon Festival
It is a festival to welcome home the souls of departed ancestors and to have memorial services
It was very strong wind in Okinawa until last night by Typhoon　MUIFA
There is a large aquarium　named Okinawa Curaumi Aquarium in Okinawa
I went to there the other day
It was very impressive
I swam 1,000 meters at outdoor swimming pool last evening
The water was comfortably cool
But,maybe,I will get muscular pain tomorrow
We have started seeing each other for 8 Months, before I came to here to study abroad
Most of couples break up very easily, when one of them goes to abroad or they have far relationship,(?) because it just doesn't go work well
Although it is quite difficult to keep contact with each other or talk each other by Skype or something, I have had only 2 Boyfriend in my life included my recent boyfriend, so I don't know much about relationship things, but I think it is possible to keep their relationship when both of them respect and trust each other and don't restrain each other
It may be different, when i am not sure,when I go back to Japan
But still, I am not sure if we are going to get married in the future, because we are still student and don't have money neither,and in addition there are lots of nice people in the world
Englische Poem
I want to ask English native speaker if you can read and understand English poems(like Shake spear, John Milton, Spenser and so on) as they read todays English.(like this kind of Poem below,for example
Of course I heard often that it is also difficult for Native speaker to understand Shake spear,because their English is not the same
But I am so depressed these days because I can not understand English Poem at all
But if there is also difficult for native speaker, my sorrow will comfort a bit
And I want to know if there is helpful website to understand English poem
If somebody knows them,let me know please
Sometimes I am thinking about why american people often say  \"cool!\"or \"awesome\" for something unimportant things
Maybe it is just to express their surprise or impression in a exaggerate way
But I have never said such kind of exaggerate expression so often in Japanese before
But When I speak in English, I use sometimes these expression
But every time I feel a bit ashamed after I says these words
Maybe because I haven't get used to say so I don't feel so comfortable
Usually I'm not so talkative and sociable person in Japan, but here I must be sociable and talkative
This is a bit stressful for me to change myself
Maybe when I became to speak English fluently, I would not feel so stressful, because I could express myself in \"Japanese mood\" 
「Ｒ」and 「L」Pronounciation
Yesterday I was talking with an american guy during the dinner about English
It is said that japanese pepple can't tell difference \"R\" and \"L\",because we don't have such pronouciation in Japanese
That's true,but although I've already known that how they pronouce \"L\"and \"R\",I couldn't tell the difference \"Work\" and \"Walk\" yesterday
It sounds almost same to me
In German it is totally different pronounciation,like \"arbeiten\"(work) and \"spazieren\"(walk) that's why sometimes German is easier for me than English
I think people who speasks English as a mother tongue,they use very often their toungue than Japanese,because I seldom use my toungue when I am speaking
I hear quite often that amereican people start their conversation with \"I mean..\" or \"To be honest..\" or \"like
I don't know why,so I asked him about this yeserday
It is one of the ways to start converstion
I suppose that it is like \"えっと～\"”っていうか～”　in Japanese
Reading English is also difficult,because I always translate it unconsciously from English to Japanese,otherwise I can't get the meaning sometime
For exsample, There is a lot of sentences which begin with \"that\" or \"which\" and they add the sentence
But When I have to translate it in Japanese,I always have to read after \"which\" or \"that sentence and go back to the first sentence
Maybe I have to take granted for that English and Japanese have a different construction
Nowadays I try to read English book without \"reconstract\" into Japanse,although I can't get it sometime
I hope someday I can read English book like English speaker is reading
No Drug
I just watched a movie \"requiem for a dream\" tonight which took place in the one of the institution of the University and I came back home right now
Movie night takes place every Tuesday night during the semester and the Theme of this semester is \"Drugged up reality
But I didn't think that tonight's movie deals with so heavy Theme and desperate ending, before I started to watch the movie
It was too hard for me to watch all the scenes
After the movie, I couldn't say anything about the movie
I was just stunned by Drug's horror and so upset
This movie could be suitable as an education movie for young people, although it is too violent and shocking
I often see the poster in Japan which is written, \"No, absolutely
It suggests for young people not to try Drug, but I think this message is too weak to pass to the young people
When they watch this movie one time, most of people never want to try Drug and I hope so
Recently my body itches so much without no reason
At first I thought because of dry air or hard water here, my body itches
but my body itches still although I always apply cream to my body after taking shower
Every week I change my Bedcover and wash it, and clean my room by vacuum cleaner
I hope it will be fine an soon as possible, or maybe it is better to go to the hospital
Can I say I treated myself to buy this expensive chocolate?(or I dared to buy such an expensive chocolate?) 
Life is like a chokorate box
I visited my Italian Friend whom I haven't seen for 3years
I was very afraid at first,when I got on the train going to Milalno
As soon as I got on the train and found the seat,two Police men came into the train with a big dog
It seemed that they were trying to find the person who has a drag
And a woman who sat next to me was arrested by the police,because the dog didn't stop barking in front of her
She was taken away by the police and gotten off the next station
Very nice beggining
I was really relieved,when I saw my friend at the Milano station
I was happy to see her and any chages of her
We went to her home at first and talked about everything what happend to us in these 3 years
I was known that She just broke up with her boyfriend last year and has been kind a depressed since then
She seemed to be little tired
After I listened to her wohl story,I found in her face some tierdness and boredness in her life
She works from monday to Friday and has a few friend in Milano,she explained me.(She was born in Napoli and moved to Milano 2 years ago
I tried to her to be happy during I stayed at her home
I gave her a chokolate box which I bought in Switzerland
There were a lot of different kind of chokolates in the box
She said me
Life is like a chokolate box
Everyday,we can eat different taste of chokolates 
She said me that she was known this phrase in the movie \"Forest Ganp
I also watched this movie before,but I've alsreay forgotten this Phrase
Yes, Life may be like a chokolate box
Although We eat bitter chokolate today,we will eat sweet chokolate with a lot of flavors tomorrow
She is now in a different moment in her life,but I'm sure that someday she will be happy again,like a chokolate box
Today I discussed about the difference between Japanese and English during the lecture
but not only English,but also other Language in general
I think that most difference between them is letters of course,but also pronunciation is the most different and it makes English very difficult for us
Because we can't pronounce English what we read
But you can pronounce Japanese what you read
Almost every one can understand what you say in Japanese,although you don't pronounce correctly or naturally
But when I pronounce English wrongly, nobody can understand what I say
What the difficult is only writting, I guess
I just finished watching this Video now through TED which is one of my favorite web-site
I think her speech is interesting, but not so surprising, because I've already thought about similar things like her before, but still I agree with her to some extent
As I've already written a diary here in German before, I think English is going to be (or already) a World language now
I know that this notion is very controversial, but it's true as far as I know or experienced
And I don't think English is very bad choice, because there are lots of similar languages which are originally come from Latin
I don't know much about linguistic things, but what i want to say is that English has a lot of brother language like German or French.) and most of people (of course not everyone )have already had some English knowledge and the English grammar is not that difficult compared to another language
although it's very troublesome to learn an another language,but it's still very fun
When I went to Tunisia this January, I spend a very nice time with one Tunisian family, because one of them spoke to me in English in the airplane
When we would not have had a common language, it must have been impossible to communicate with them and spend at their house, because I can't speak either Arabic or French, while they can't speak Japanese
English became a tool to connect the person to person
I'm so exhausted 
Two different grope of my friends visited me last week, that's why I didn't have time for me and writing a diary here
I enjoyed very much spending time with my friends, but my conscious pricks me now because of my  laziness
So I tried to go to the library today after the lecture and read some English books which i have to read for my lecture
One is Mary Shelly's \"Frankenstein\" and the other is \"generation X
It was still hard for me to read English book or attend the class which is taught in English, because every Sentence which i read or listen goes from my left ear through the right ear
I know that it takes a long time to be good at English, but I'm very frustrated when I can't understand English or say in English when I want to say something
Of course I can notice some small changes of me compared to the last 3 Months, but still I can't be satisfied with my present English level, because I think that English is not so difficult language in the world
But I like learning English recently, because sometimes I can notice the improvement of my English, when I talk with English speaker or when I watch \"TED\" (This is my favorite
I become very happy, when I can understand what they say
It was second time for me to think that English is not so difficult language to learn and is so much fun to speak it,although my english is not good:D
It was first time for me to go abroad alone and stay with an unknown,american people
What I learned the most during this home stay, was how big and free America is ,and many a variety of people live together and how much life will be change,when I could speak \"English
That's why I changed my course,when I was a third-year student at highshcool
But as soon as I entered the University,my passion for English was gone,because there were a lot of japanese people in my department who speak English really good.(Most of them were returnee Child
I will not criticze or be envy of returnee Child,because they must have also had a lot of difficulty and it was not their choice to be born as returnee Child
As the time passed, I became to think that it is useless to learn English,because I thought that how hard I learn English,I can't be native speaker
That's why I really hate to speak English in Japan(especially in the class),because I didn't want to be thought that my english is bad and strange
But I realize later that my thought is falsh
I don't have to be \"native speaker\",because I can never be native english speaker,because I am Japanese
Since then I became to like English again and start learning English
Further more, I traveled recently in north Africa and there I got know a local people who spoke English without hesitating to speak,although he made a lot of mistakes
He works for hotel,and Every visiter understood what he said
It depend on what kind of situation you need to speak English
When you just want to enjoy conversation with people or just travel, you don't need high level of English
My goal is to be able to read book in English, get knowledge in English from the internet without using dictionary so often,talk and discuss the complicated issue with people in the world
I have no idea how many yeard it takes
Today I started to learn Spanish very spontaneously from one of my friend from Mexico
I just learn is as a fun,not seriously
Now I put the most emphasis on learning English and German,because English is of course important for my study and future job
German is just one of my favorite language.(A lot of people often say that German is not so beautiful language because of its strong and harsh sound, but I love this language because it sounds very cool and especially I love this Grammar because it is so good organized and logical
Before i started to learn German, I didn't think that people can learn more than 2 languages at the same time, but now I became to think that it's possible to learn some different languages at the same time,because I assume that there is lots of merit and multiplier effects
If you learn only one language and once get into problem over it, you don't feel like learning it anymore and probably stop learning it and have always an awareness that it will be hard to deal with
But if you learn also another language,it will be much better,because you can switch from it to that temporally and can have a short break until you become to learn it again

Yesterday I sent a email one of my friend who lives in Cairo
I traveled this winter to Egypt and at that time he helped me a lot and showed the city by his car
So that's why I wanted to express my gratitude for him and wrote like that
This trip was most impressive trip ever among my travel before
I oft tended to think about same things when I was with my ex-boyfriend in Japan
I can't believe the time I some day die
And also I can't imagine when I have to live alone without my important people around me
when I read the news about the resent big earthquake in New Zealand every morning and think about one 19-years Japanese boy who studies there like me and all of sudden got into an incident and had to be cut his right foot, I can't find any words to say for such a tragedy
Of course he is not only victims that was involved in this calamity, but also a lot of people died because of it
But still I feel so sad about him,because he is so young and can't probably play anymore soccer with his team which he captained at his high school
I don't know for what on purpose I was born and live as Japanese and have no idea when I might die, but I thought that I have to express my gratitude for living healthy every day , after I read his comment on the news Interview
Most japanese like Ramen Noodle Soup
I recommend two Ramen House near Enoshima
Fast of all, I explane Enoshima
Enoshima is centerd along the coast of Sagami Bay
The region alonge the coast is called Shonan
Shonan beach is most populer in Japan
Gettin back to my main subject, I recommend Two Ramen House
The Master of Taishoken called God of Ramen
A kind of recommended ramen is TSUKEMEN
There are SHIROMARU of white color and AKAMARU of red color
A kind of recommended ramen is SHIROMARU
When you come Enoshima, you had better go
I found out that what you want is what you enjoy it in childhood
Why am I doing a designer now
That sure bring out a memory
When I was schoolboy,I often drew cartoons on many schoolbooks
I liked to drawing a picture
One day when I was six year old boy , I was drawing a candy store in front of my house
I give the store owner my picture 
My picture had been displayed until close down
I could never see myself as a designer
Probably,the pictuer make what I am
I'II contemplate my future looking my album
It was the state that I was on a rooftop of a school with my brother
I catched a small light
At that instant UFO come above my head
And, UFO have increased in number
I like a movie kind of UFO like Steven Spielberg
But, I was actually scared  to meet UFO
Although I woke, I had clearly remembering the situation
I want to talk someone
He give a peace of mind and a little anger me
For some reason or other, I watched a news on web this evening
There is a frightenig news
I read a report is written web desiginer on web
These are Time , Money , Quality
But, It's difficult that three elements balance each other
My style of job is freelance
I watched the movie that title is \"The Social Network
This story is a man of success story
When he was student
He made \"Facebook\" that it is community service on web
The more Facebook grow, The more many problem of human relations go on increasing
So he got big money, big power
But he didn't get the girl his loved
When he requested her friend approval,but there is not response
I think that even if human get success, he may be empty without love
Today,I have a date with my best friend in college
We met at 12:00, Taipei Main Station first then have lunch in the restaurant named \"Momo paradise\", which is a Sukiyaki restaurant served as all-you-can-eat
The beef and pork all fresh and soft,we used to immerse the sliced meat into the liquefied egg then boil it instantly
It really tasty that I will visit the restaurant next time and introduce to my friends
I was cought in a shower
Today I brought an ambrella with me because I knew it was going to rain today from weather forecast
But as usual, I forgot to bring it to my office building
It is a little far from parking lot
I was in a hurry, because I had to pick my kids up at nursery on time
So I had to do without anything that cover me
I was caught in a shower though I wore a new clothes
I always like my character that I dont't worry about things so much
But sometimes like today, I regret my carelessness
The influence of Mickey Mouse
Do you know the TV program Mickey Mouse Club House
Of course my son and my daughter are not the exception
They reply Mickey's queations, but never reply my question
I feel a kind of jealous toword Micky
I accept the situation, and I'm clazy about Lang-8 beside them
a smorgasbord restaurant
We went to a smorgasbord restaurant
Thinking of smorgasbord restaurants, you may imagine the one whose dishes are  not so delicious and cheep (in Japan), but they serve delicious food and it is neither cheep nor too expensive
That was a right restaurant when the common people like me want to be a bit extravagant
But because I am a forgetable person, I forgot my kids being constantly on the move
They were very busy going for food
They went back and forth many times
I had to watch them not to spill juice and food
What a restless time it was
Now I'm finally relaxed while they are having a nap
husband doesn't eat dinner today
My husband called me and said that he doesn't need dinner today
He is going to eat outside with his colleagues
I said that I wish I could eat with him
But after I hung up the phone I said \"Yes
Of course if I eat dinner with him, it would be more enjoyable
But as you know, it is  much easier to cook only for my children
Children don't care about the number of the dishes
The simplest recipe,Ramen,is always welcomed by them
So I don't have to cook today
I love you,my husband
Today I joined my daughter's school trip
It was sunny and perfect for the trip
We went the zoo by bus
The zoo is on the way to a mountain, so it is very tiring to walk in the zoo
We have to walk up and down all the way to see animals
We parents were all exhausted but children still had a lot of energy left even on the bus back
Where does their energy come from though their bodies are so small
I live in United States for more then one and a half year
I fill myself lonely because I'm shy
I shy to talk to somebody because of my English
I do not know where are pong-pong clubs
At tennis cords everybody has a partner
It's too hard to find person by interest in internet in my region(Portland, ME
It would be very nice to find a friend near here who'd like to know Russian
That are my sad thoughts
Our house - is the planet Earth
We, ordinary people can not deal with global problems of ecology of the surrounding world, but each of us can make even a small contribution to something to improve the world around us
Each of us can put at least one tree in his life
If we leave the house a short distance then we can do it on foot or by bicycle
Today a student in my class wrote like this, \"I have many homework
After that, an ALT teacher told me that the former sentece was not wrong
My 3 year old son had his hair cut at a barber this morning
He has ever had his hair cut at the barber before, but at that time he 
When the barbar was wrapping around his shoulders with the cape, he
said \"Mama～, don't leave me alone!\" in small voice
Soon his eyes began to be filled with tears and tears dropped onto the cape
To stop him from crying, an idea hit on me
There was a cake shop near the barbar, I promised that I would buy
some cakes for him, if he doesn't cry
I asked him which cake he wants chocolate cake or starawvery cake
He answered, \"chocolate one
He followed barber's instructions and he 
As he sat by himself, the cut fee cost only 800 yen
After that, I left home for my school to redord my students' test score 
We have to make students' evaluation three times a year
Today, my husband went to other school because some schools have the matches there
Probably, he will come back home around 3
After that, I have to go to Takarazuka station to meet my basket club students
So I pick them up at the middle point between the teacher's house and our school
In fact, I had to go to the match together, but he said I didn't need to go theree because I have a little child
Anyway, I could do nothing except for caring for my son and cleaning my house
That was boaring weekend～～
I teach at a junior high and there are not any air-conditioner except for the teachers' room
Besides, we have school lunce in such a terrible classroom
I am always sweating heavily and at the end of the work and my shirt is sticking to my body with perspiration
The government should install air-conditoners at first before installing 
internet ( including the electric boards, the big screen terevision )equipment
who wear halloween costume like a black cat, a witch, a jack o' 
My son is also going there wearing funny costume
As I had flu last week, my mother cooked sushi for my family and 
We put cooked vineger rice on a piece of seaweed, then put the materials you like on it and roll it up
Temaki-zushi\" is a type of sushi which each person make sushi 
Prepare a bawl of cooked rice and materials like salmon, 
handy-sized seaweed and put rice and your favorite materials on it 
and roll it up by oneself
preparation is very easy and everyone can enjoy making and eating 
A Chirashi Zushi\" is a big sushi served in a bowl, with sushi materials
When you have no appetite you can eat sushi, because the vinegar 
rice is taste at all
How can I say the last sentence \"because the vinegar rice is taste at all\"(\"すめし（酢飯＝vinegar rice）は、さっぱりした味だからです\" ) in English
Does it make sence
Last night, a father of a girl student called our school
The girl student has decided to retire the basket ball club for various 
Our team is one of the strongest team in Hyogo pre., but 
her level is lower than other students and she is seldom chosen as a 
Last year, she bullied a girl student in the basket ball team
The father of the bullier came to school an apologize the student and 
her parents in the principal room
However, the girl who was bulllied retired the team at that time and 
This time the bullier told me that she wanted to retire the team
One of the reason is that her level and other students' level are too 
Other 4 members has started to play basketball when they 
But, she was not
The second reason is that she can't get along with other team mates
This is because her father has made
Her father has interfered every 
For example, to use public portation when going 
Our city is in the suburb and difficult to traver 
I took a pay off today, too. 
I was going to go to work today
I had taken day off for 5 days from last Wednesday because of swine
flu, but I'm getting much better and I thought I can go to work today
However, I still had a soar throat and I couldn't speak last night
I couldn't speak in voice at all
This sympton didn't change this morning either
I am a school teacher, and I can't do my lessons without speaking
So, I decided to stay home today
After calling to my school to tell my absent, I noticed that tomorrow is a national holiday, \"culture day
I should have gone to school
It seems to be a long holidays
A murder has been arrested
The murder of a British English teacher has been arrested after more 
than two years' run Today
The photo was opened to the public and some witnesses called the 
I think that the hospitals did the surgery has to be accused because
they helped the murder's escape
It is not the typical bread we eat in Christmas, Panettone is my dog's name, he's an one year old boy-dog, and even if we have another five dogs and I love all of them he's my favorite one ^^ 
Well, may be I saw him growing up, without a mommy, I used to sing for him and we used to run many kilometers under the blue sky or the cold rain, I take care of him when he's ill, when I'm crying he seems to know what happens to me and stay with me whining so cutely ^^ I really love him
Sadly since the university started I don't have enough time to stay with him
he's with the another ones living in the country, and I'm here in the city alone
This year I've started to study ballet, it's known that you only can learn to dance ballet when you are a child, or at least that was I always tought, but I was lucky to have the chance
I won't lie, I was really ashamed because I was the oldest of the girls there, but with time passing I learnt to enjoy it 
Our professor always says: \"I will never permit my students to be less than me, you have to be equal or better than me\" 
This month he wants our debut as a ballet company, not only as a academy, so we are doing a show with another academies of Peru, Chile and Argentina
We are doing \"Coppelia\", even if we are not proffesionals dancers just adding a little of fun to the original play is doing it great
My vacation days are nearly over, so I tought it was a good time to get some wind
I went to my parent's farm and from the third floor of our home I enjoyed the whole day feeling the wind and watching the far ocean, I was thrilled until the day ended, it has been so wonderful that I didn't want my day to finish
I eat there, I heard some music there, I read some of my favorites fics there and I had a lot of fun ^^ alone, I like to be alone most of the time, judging I have a sister she wouldn't like to stay the whole day under the sun anyway, I know ^^ 
It seems that when you're enjoying the most you're able to, the time pass too quick, well, that's how I felt it
After all, the night was wonderful too ^^ there weren't too much stars to see as usual, but the moon was shining and I could see the city
made me feel worried again, thinking of the next day, I had to came back and do the things I'm used to, to come back to the routine
It have been too long since I write an entry here
a university student's life never seemed this hard (_ 
It's not I'm complaining about it, I mean, I know that anything is easy, but still
homework drive me crazy
I came here, the city, only for educational reasons, and I used to go to the farm every weekend to visit my parents, my pets and the another animals ^^ I had a lot of fun
But ultimately I haven't gone to the farm, that makes me a little sad, it's really a beautiful place, that's why I talk a lot about it 
To take some rest and to improve my english too
realy, I haven't been studying it, I hope you can help me
Here, in my country is supossed to be summer, and, yeah, is very hot most of the times
but these days, it's been only raining, and it isn't a summer rain; isn't normal
My city is situated near the sea, so when it rains the sea becomes dangerous and for fishermen it is so dificult
Well, I don't live so near the beach, not now 'cause I study in the city but I have friends living near there, and the fact that something can happen to them make me feel fear
Now is rainig too, I can't go out 'cause it is a little imposible to see the streets 'cause the fog
May be it is a real Global Warming, we can't play with the earth anymore
It has been a time ago I was shocked for the announcement of Yumiko's retirement
on september this year
what happen
U it's so sad, I would be peaceful if Yumiko was the one who wanted to retire; may be, I tought, she want a rest and if she wants because of her happiness, I will be happy too
she is so talented, great voice, good dancing, excellent acting, why
Now Chika san (Mizu Natsuki), her retirement annoucement was so strange, I mean, normally when someone is retiring the company has all ready to use the new as a kind of publicity for the show; but this time nobody, neither Chika san know nothing about the show; and it has been announced 9 months before; the normal thing is 6 months ago
all those things don't let me sleep, yeah I know, it's kind of silly 
but, what should I do
Actually there is a contest in a LJ community for Mizu&Yumiko, about fics and fanarts, the most wonderful are the prizes
nothing easy but nothing impossible too ^^, the contest ends on February 16th and I don't have written any word T-T, it's not my fault, there have been many many really many politicals problem in my university and it affected us so much
I wanna, at least, participe with something, but something good
As you know, everybody has experienced to have conflicts with others, at home, at school, at work, etc
Now I'd like to tell you about the tips for handling these conflicts
Communication should be like playing catch, not just one way
If you are too stubborn and never change your opinion or never compromise, it will cause some troubles
We want to avoid conflicts but we can't do them 100 %, so we should keep these tips in our minds and have good relationships with others
I am very shy and cowardly
When I was High school student, I studied English very hard
But I couldn't get a good grade in English
So I don't have any confidence i my English
But recently, I thought study in English once more

If you check this daily, you have irritation
Now I wrote this daily with the help of a dictionary
I want to you to check my daily, have you generously

The most fun and enjoyable day in this week was today
Before, because I wasn't used to taking a bus by myself, I was a bit lazy to go out
Especially, to get San Francisco, it was too far for me
Just after I got off my bus in SF downtown, I already felt hungry even though I had breakfast at home
Sweet one
Since I came in America, I'd like to do some exercises like Yoga, and jogging
Then I found good stuffs with reasonable prices
It wasn't so far than I thought
I got some bread and a hot chocolate at Starbucks and walked toward bay

I hope he is getting better soon 
There are no more important things than good health 
Today I watched a DVD, p
This was the second times for me
Actually, I was gonna go on a trip today 
But unfortunately my flight was canceled because of typhoon as you know
As I finished watching the DVD, I got the phone from a travel agency
I knew that almost all flight tickets were already booked, so that I don't know if i can go on another day or not
It brought tears to me still more and more
What a husband said in his last letter is still in my mind
 I am a part of your life \" \" don't be afraid of your new life \" 
So anyways I thought this situation i have faced is just a part of my time(?) 
I collect myself and hope to visit Taiwa---n as soon as possible ♪
Recently, I knew that there are cafes for English conversation
I searched on the internet, then I found several types of cafes such as people who want to learn English gather somewhere like a community center or an office and speak English and have a coffee together, or some people just go to a bar for chatting and at there, it seems to be set up tables divided by the language levels
Of course, it costs a bit more than usual cafes, but it sounds fun for me that similar people gather and learn English by the casual way
I was better at penmanship when I was in junior highschool, learned by my dad and grandma
I got prizes, too
But, seeing such a penmanship like today, I become to feel like doing Syuji
I'm sure that this can make our handwritings much better, so that I want to learn it again, and so do my children in the future
Last week, I had a full weekend off, Saterday and Sunday
I was going to go to San Francisco, but I thought that I didn't know about my living town at all yet, so I decided to wander around my city, Redwood
First I searched on the internet and found that there was a Salsa Festival at the downtown
When I arrived in the town, I heard music and saw many small shops on the street
There were also a food market which sold fresh vesitable, bread and so on
I bought a sugar butter bread at a shop
The shop seemed like a french bakery because there were tip bags in front of the window, which said \" Merci
I like France very much so I felt happy that I had lunch from the shop
The Salsa festival was fun
Some groups were on the stage and played music
It was really fun time
I felt like dancing, too even though I don't know how to dance Salsa
That's because customers are reading a lot of books there and there are even settled chairs for the people
Also the book store I went today was very big and cafes were inside
I can't believe --- 
I got a ticket after sticking out for it 
I was trying to book a flight ticket for Taiwan since my flight had been canceled by a crazy typhoon few days ago
However it was almost impossible because even if I called various travel agencies a LOT, they said almost all of the tickets were already booked
Especially, a return ticket was sold out; but happily, I found only one seat which still existed 
I really couldn't believe it and so I asked the person two times
is there still one seat left 
Moreover, one of the another agencies suggested me reserving a cheapest bussiness class which costs about 50000 yen 
In conclusion, the price I finally booked iiiiis about 30000 yen :)) 
I'm so happy with this Miracle ★★★
I had a guidance for my new part-time job today
It was scheduled for 6 p.m. I was directed to wear a business suit
But I didn't have a summer shirt, so I needed to buy new one
I went to shop with my mom before I headed out
I could find it soon :) 
After shopping, I changed my clothes into my suit and then, found that I left a stockings at home on this particular day 
So I had to buy a stockings, too 
I had just bought some pairs of them recently 
However I noticed the time I supposed to catch a train was too late 
I thought in my heart omg
I couldn't attend the guidance
I couldn't believe how I misunderstood
I was shocked at my carelessness
new words
I'll keep my study today, too
A baby finally rised to his feet

Dream is not running
Running is always oneself
There were many beautiful rocks so I raelly enjoied
When I was climbing, I think fear at some time
But When I climbed finisy the rock ,I most happy
Every one charge climbing don’t you
This is the first dialy for me
This is my first dairy here
I think I can start from introducing myself
I live in Taiwan, located at the East-South of China
Taiwan is an island, surrounding beauty ocean
Of course many famous travel spots are related with ocean and beach
For example, Kenting(墾丁) is a famous traveling spot, not also foreign tourist like it, but also local residents love it very much
Kenting is a nature landscape, and you can see white sand, swimming people anywhere
Activities all you can think playing in the water can be found there, but some have to pay money
Here is really full of delicious food, but I don’t know whether it’s suit for foreigner
Mayday was formed from 1997 and still very popular in Taiwan
The members composed the team are a lead singer (Ashin), two guitarists (Monster and Stone), a bassist (Masa) and a drummer (Ming
Why am I attracted deeply by them
The answers are many reasons, including their songs and their spirits
Their songs are different with other band because it always touches me very much
The style of songs by they made are various and it reveals their strength and genius
The lyrics of the songs always are meaningful and reflect the thought of teenagers
When I listened to their songs, I laughed, excited, encouraged and even cried
Their music is true nice
However, it’s the touch by the songs rather than the pleasant of the music that makes Mayday is so fascinating and successful
They will hold a concert in Kaohsiung in December 5
I’m looking forward the day coming
My hometown is Kaohsiung, located in the south of Taiwan and it has one side facing to the ocean
Kaohsiung is the second big city of Taiwan, the first one is Taipei
Many years ago, Kaohsiung was an important harbor for trading and brought about its prosperity in the future
Besides, it played a significant role in the industry of Taiwan because there were some factories in the suburb
Furthermore, there is a national airport in Kaohsiung, so the transportation is convenient if you want to visit it
With the time going by, there are some changes in Kaohsiung
The local government did some effort to expand tourism and big constructions
For example, Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), shopping mall and an arena for World Games 2009
All residents were proud of the success to hold a glorious athletic evening
Besides, the one of most characterization is the enthusiasm of local residents, and we welcome any visitors to come here
In addition, there are many delicious foods, and you can find it in a night market
If you like nature landscape, you can go to coast in the sunset and look the sun hiding slowly under the ocean line
I never leave my hometown for a long time since I have born
It’s coincident that every school where I studied in locates in Kaohsiung
Therefore, my every period and memory can’t separate with this place
More older I am, more beautiful it becomes
Kaohsiung is a developed city and filled with kind people
It makes me have serious running noise
Even it results in my headache
Whenever I went to see a doctor, he always said that the allergy will happen when my resistance is low
Besides, the allergy is common when the weather change, especially temperature change dramatically
Someone say the moist air is easier to induce allergy than the dry air
Doctors tell me the best way to cure the allergy is to increase my resistance to cold
I hope I can get rid of allergy one day, or it’s really affects my studying schedule
But the premise is cats are absent in the surrounding, because I am severely sensitive to fur of cats
So, I hope all of my friends are enjoying outside with drinking, dancing or whatever
Me
Anyway, today I wrote a complaint letter to get refund from airline
It would be great if you could help me with this writing
I’m writing to complain about our flight with your company
We have just returned from Canada and unfortunately 
First of all, because of 3 hours delay of your plane, we missed the local bus services and had to a use taxi, which 
made us to pay extra money
Furthermore, your brochure promised us to have friendly well-qualified staff, but when we were on board they did 
not smile at all, and their every single action was too slow
Also, I have to tell you that we have not had the meal, because there was no vegetarian food
Therefore, we had to 
get out of this situation with a few candies
Moreover, contrary to your brochure, there were only out-of-date entertainments such as films in 1980’s there, and 
In view of all this we feel we deserve a full refund and letter of apology
I hope this matter will receive your immediate attention
This weekend I've got a lot of homework from the school
Especially, I have to write more than 3 writing tasks with 120-180 words
And also, there are several grammar and reading tasks
So, I'm in the process
I've already finished some of them, but still lots of works left
It would be great, if I could get any correction from you, before I hand out to the school
First of all, I totally agree with your idea to go and see much music, because in Tokyo there are many places to be able to enjoy music on cheap price
For example, if you visit club houses near my university, you can see many amateur bands playing wide range of music
Although they are not professional, the level is quite high
My most favorite one is located near Ueno station where you’re going to stay
If you get any extra request, please feel free to let me know
I'm writing the new article again
Here is a task about casual letter writing
I think it's easier to write than formal letter, because you can improve the vocab in everyday conversation
Thanks for your letter it was good to hear from you, I enjoyed reading your update
By the way, do you remember the family living my next door
They moved to the next town last month, and the another family has moved in the house
Contrary to the ex-family, which has 8 members, they are smaller family with only 4 members with 2 children
Although the new family is also great, I prefer the ex-family
You know, especially the old couple of the ex-family was so kind for me and every time I went to their house they were staying at home and we could enjoy having a conversation
Especially, the father seems to be working all the day on weekdays and I have no chance to see him
And also, every weekend they go shopping or something, so I rarely see them on weekends
The main source was Christchurch, which was located in the South Island, and I'm in the North Island, Although I was not involved it fortunately, watching the damage on the internet TV, I felt that there was no surprise that it could have happened to me
I would like to comment on the article about the work camp in Kirby on 23rd February
I feel I must point out that much of the information was misleading
Firstly, the article stated that there were 30 students, but in fact there were only 15 
Secondly, you claimed that they spent all summer picking fruit and vegetables
spent only mornings on weekends, and had free time on weekends
Thirdly, According to the article, the accommodation was old tent
However, the actual one was 
In view of all this, the article deserves to be corrected
you publish the corrected edition
I am bit sleepy because I went to the bed 2am last night
Anyway, today I’d like to share with you my emails written few days ago
Usually, you can’t get any correction after you send email
Then, it’s highly possible for you to make same mistakes again and again
So, I thought it’s helpful to get correction from you through this site

I think I should have been abroad when I was younger because I could have got wider view
So, if I were you, I would make many foreign friends and visit their countries as many as possible
Of course, it would be great, if you come to Japan in the future
Living in foreign country is sometimes very stressful, as you said, especially about language
However, personally, I'm satisfied with the life here and I wish I could extend the stay (I have only 2 more months
Especially, what I could live with 3 different families and also with one of my friends here was very valuable experience

So, let's keep be easy to write email, and please do it anytime you want
Then see you next time 
That's my pleasure, thank you for your reply
I'm willing to write as many articles as possible and would like to use English more fluently
As many my friends wrote, yesterday was St Valentin's Day
Did you guys enjoy it
Fortunately, I've got some cookies & chocolates from my friends and girlfriend, so I'm enjoy eating them at the moment

Firstly, I would like to know what transport I could use
I suppose it would be plane or coach, but I am not sure

I miss weekend
This part test not only your English skill but also your capacity to think
So, this is very tough part for non-native speakers
It would be great if you could correct my English and give me your own answers to the question
However, I suppose life without electricity was so boring for me
Especially, I would miss the media like TV or internet, because I spend much time on using them
That’s because our life is totally depending on electricity and I haven’t heard any alternatives before
Although there are other powers, such as gas, they can’t cover the energy which electricity is producing now
Which do you think is the best way of making electricity
That’s a quite tough question, because no one is sure about this question
That’s because, the amount of fossil fuels is quite limited and it’s not good choice from the point of view of sustainability
Also, Natural energy can’t cover the demand of energy for now
Although Nuclear energy has many risks, I believe it’s still the best way for now
For example, if they search why the rain forest in Amazon has been disappearing, they’ll know several reasons related with economic, politics or whatever
Because, I think if you get extra time thanks to them, you’ll have time to do the other thing
For example, if I got cleaning robot and it allowed me to get one extra hour per week, I would spend the time on studying English or something like that in stead of cleaning
I believe movies and dramas are playing an important roll
Although learning from text books or museums are also important, watching movies and dramas are more familiar with younger generation
Personally, I’ve got a lot of knowledge from them, for example I’m a fun of the drama set in the age of Civil wars in Japan, and thanks to them I become familiar with the life at that time
Here is the second writing homework today
This writing task is story-making
To be honest, I like to make story, because in other tasks like report, you have to follow many rules, but when you write story, you have room to make use of your own imagination
Anyway, it would be great if you could help me to brush-up this task
With tensed face, Sarah was sitting on the chair in the waiting room of the dentist
Actually, this was the first time for her to come here
That was not because she had not got any cavities before, but because she had simply been scared to be here
When she was looking through something to read, which might be a gossip article or something, her name was called by the receptionist
Entering the room, the dentist in his 50’s was sitting there with smiling face
When she was looking around the room, suddenly the boy laid on the next chair started screaming
“Oh my God,” she nearly said that
And then the dentist asked her to open her mouth with holding a strange drill
She wished she could have rejected it, but she had no choice but to do so
And the next moment, the tool was inserted and she didn’t remember anything just after that

We decided on traveling together a few days
He said \" i want to wear lungi\" (Lungi is Indian folk costume
It is like waistcloth
We looked for Lungi and discovered who sold
He asked Lungi price and began to beat down
We didn't know correct price but we guessed they sold higher than in general
So we always thought when we bought we should beat down as possible as we can
Maby at first the clerk showed about 55dollars
After 20minutes,he bought 46dollars
When he negotiated, I thought strange because the clerk's child was laghing
He took off pants and weared the Lungi soon but he was ashamed
He said \"The wind come under the Lungi
When we came back hotel, hotel man laugh suddenly
We received the his smile favorable and said\"Yeah
It's Lungi
He said
It's just tablecloth
he wound tablecloth which was 46dollars on underwear
Very high price

She explained chopstick to him \"This is Chupa Chups
I and sister roared
Naturally he didn't understand, but she said \"This is Chupa Chups\" many time because she didn't know the reason why he didn't
Maybe I guessed she thought her pronunciation was bad
We would like to solve this misunderstand, but she said \"Chupa Chups\" too hard to speak

I would like to say something about an economy and an stock exchange
I don't know how situation looks in other countries but in Poland if you are retired and you don't have own savings your life may be difficult in the future
Of course it is not the rule because there are also people who have really high pension and they life very well
But young people like me should worry about theirs future
In my opinion the situation is going to be worst with every year
People life longer but they have less children than before
So the group of people who work is getting smaller than this who are retired
And that is one of the reason why pensions are getting lower in the future
So I decided a few years ago to learn how to invest my savings on the Warsow Stock Exchange (The Stock Exchange that function in Poland
Since that moment I have achieved some experience on how the market function
I have to admitt that I lost some of my money but I also earned it on the market
Now I am still not a milionar but in the future who konws 
Of course investmensts on the market are not for everyone
I you fear of losing your money or you prefer secure way of getting money you shouldn't try it
But I can say that the market teached me patience and responsibility
There is a lot of aspects on how the economy works people should be familar with
Not everyone earn a fortune and I'm aware of that but I have tried it and I don't regret this decision
Formula one has become very popular in Poland since a polish car driver Rober Kubica started to drive as a professional F1 driver in BMW Sauber F1 Team
Probably In Poland formula one in peak of popularity was as popular as ski jumping where more than ten years Adam Małysz in my opinion the best polish sportsman ever was on top in general classification of world cup
This year Adam finished his sports career
If you don't know who Małysz is, I encourage you to visit for example http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adam_Ma%C5%82ysz
Let's back to F1
I often fall asleep watching F1 grand prix
Since that tragic day until now Robert is in a hospital in Italy
There was a risk that he could even lost his right arm because it was crunched
Fortunately everything is well now and as I read lately Robert has started to walking and in near future he should leave the hospital
I wish him fast recovery and I hope he will return to F1 in this season or the next one
It was not the first one car accident that Robert has
In 2007 in GP Canada Robert has very dangerous accident
You can see what has happend in youtube http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MZqBbLyp6oo. 
In 2008 in the same GP Canada Robert won his first race
This is my first post here so probalby there will be a lot of mistakes
I live in capital of Poland where I also study
I am on a 4th year IT on an electronic department at one of the biggest University of Technology in my country
I have some experience in job because for two years I have been working as system administrator in well known in Poland IT company
So if you have any problems with yours pc or networks ask me mayby I will be able to help you
Well, since I have passed English exam when I was at secound year of my studies, my contact with English is relly limited
So I hope that you will help me, and motivate me to work and improving my languages skills
I need some of your ideas how to learn a foreign language effectively
Until now I used to learn English from books with grammar and I read some of  novels 
But I still have no ability to write or to speek on acceptable level
Still when I want to write something I need to think a moment on every sentence and of course I'm not sure if I do it correctly
Especially if a sentence is complex
For me this website seems a really good occasion to write more
And now I have strong motivation to post here regulary
Maybe this way of learning gives me in future more self-confidence in using English
If you learn polish write it in this language, I will correct it for you :) 
At the beginning I wasn't sure if my English is sufficient enough to communicate on live with other people especially that I had quite a long break in writting and speaking in English
I am aware of the fact that my grammar skills are not on high level (that's why I am here
But I suppose that I was communicated enough because no one advices me to go to school 
It is very funny to meet other people
Text chats and voice chats are a great opportunities to know better other cultures and what people think about different topics
It is also chance of new friendships
With some of them I spoke more than some hours
I suppose that If I had known about this kind of websites before I would have done significant progress in my language skills so I recommend you to get interested in and to use them
You can simply guess my nickname :D
What is better, work in an international corporation or in a local company
Many people after graduate is wondering where they should apply for a job
The question is what is better, work for an international corporation or work for a smaller company
In my opinion it depends on type of human, his ambitions and expectations
A job in corporation is for people who are open and don't fear to contact with people from others countries
For people who like travels over the world
Probably this job is more stressful, but on the other hands it gives a lot of satisfaction
The salary in corporation is bigger and a carrer path is clearly explained
The main benefit of a job in a smaller company is that we grow up with the company
We have wider view on what the company really do
The best way is to start own business
Personally I am going to try in future every of this kind of job, starting form work for a corporation and finishing with my own business
Where would you prefer to live in your country or an abroad, in a city or in a village close to the nature
Will you finish an university
Personally I still have no idea on what to do not in ten years but even in next year after I finish my education
Probably I will try to find any interesting and well paid job in a city where I have study
Of course not to buy it but to rent it on my own or with my friends
Many international companies are building in Poland their branches so there is more and more jobs expecially in IT sector
Maybe after I get older I will move with my family (I assume to have one :) ) to more peaceful place like mountains or coast
Okay, that's enough these visions
Average length of the news is about 15-25 minutes
It's depend on a TV channel and a time of broadcasting
In Poland there are three main public channels and two commercial
Main public channels are called TVP1, TVP2, TVP INFO
The commercial one are called POLSAT and TVN
Each of the channel has the own news
First of all I have to say that no matter on the channel the news is very depressing
They are concentrated mostly on bad informations
It's probably because most people in Poland are pesimistic so they don't see positive thinks around them
In the news there are many informations about politics
It's the main part of the news, and this informations are also very negative because the news is mostly focused on showing how the main parties arguing about really unimportant subjects
I have a feeling that politicians in Poland after election completely forget about people and why and what for they were chosen
I noticed that at the end of the news they put some positive sometimes funny informations
In my opinion people should to avoid watching the TV news and try to look for information in independent sources like in the Internet
Television informations are in some way manipulated
I'm interested in how the news looks like in other countries
it's the first diary of me on this web site

I went out in a good humor,and I was being careless
Bcause of the car which forward my car was very slowly,I passed it with high speed
Then, a police man appeard behind me and chase me and warned me
You would already understand,yes,I was speeding
I was cought and lost 3 point( if you don't have penaltys,you can keep full of 3 points
And I have to pay 18,000 yen,about $200 in USA
It's a lot of money for me
After cought by police,I returned the way to the school,but I was not happy
So,my new license photo which was taken today is also unhappy face
Safety drive in very important
At last week, I tried to post my IT question on Stack Overflow and CodeProject forum, and tried to solute some question on these forums
learn how to cook
I've only cooked a few things such as sandwich and noodle
Honestly, I don't think that I'm good at cook, but someday I want to cook and prepare a meal like a full course dinner for my parents
Everyone who tastes it, wants to know her recipe :) 
Today, 5th April, is an Arbor Day
I don't know exactly whether there is also such a day in other countries, but anyway on this day people plant trees in a mountain
Several years ago, the Arbor Day was a red letter day in Korea
But the Arbor Day isn't holiday in Korea anymore
Honestly, I've never ever planted a tree in a mountain on Arbor Day, not even in a front yard
Did anyone plant a tree in the mountain on a day like this
For the People who can't speak English is very difficult to get a job
Because it is very important to speak and to understand English well
My English is terrible
I'm not sure whether I'm correctly writing
I have studied German more than English, so sometimes I'm confused, when I speak in English
Because I was a exchange student, so I could travel through Europe
They're all gorgeous, especially Italy appealed to me
In Rome I thrown a coin into the Trevi Fountain
According to the traditional legend, if visitors throw a coin into a fountain, they are ensured a return to Rom, so I hope to back to Rome again
I haven't decided destination yet
Probably we will go to South sea in August
But some day I want to travel to Europe again with family
Now I'm tired because have worked as a part-time cram school teacher all day long
But, in front of elementary school gate, I have to pass out advertising bills for kids alone tomorrow morning
I've never done this work and I'm nervous a little, but I will do it
Today My friend and I went to the gallery in Shibuya to see it for my exhibition
Then we suddenly wanted to go to Ikebukuro but I didn't know which train we have to get on
I hadn't known the Saikyo line can stop at Shibuya
I’m into watching \"kamen rider ooo\" under the influence of my nephew Haruto
Haruto is 4 years old, and always says \"Hensin!\" or \"Tajador!\"  and so on.(These all are a shout set phrases
I hadn't known what he mean for a long time but now I got everything
And the other day I watched MV sung by movie leading actors on youtube
They're joining together and enjoying dancing something like a samba
They\" are man today, a greed (monster), and Ken Matsudaira as Abarenbo-shogun (the TV period drama's star
How wonderful mix up
Hmm, I'm filled with emotions because I noticed this MV was made after the earthquake
The MC shows clear English to us and speaks slowly, so I kind of can get what he means
But I've still not gotten used to listen to English
Yes, I should listen and speak and write and read over and over again
Do you eat anything for lunch a hot day
it's really nice weather today in Japan :D
Hello, do you know this
my campus life started
My campus life on collage have been starting since 4\/2
The entrance celemony doesn't start yet
After finishing the test and I talked around, I noticed I am better at English skill than other students
Today, we went to the collage to have overhaul('physical checkup' is better
I felt a bit pity because my tall was not changed in comparison with 2 years ago
Is that becuase I am 19 years old
But In the train on the way to collage from my house, I am bored
So novels and iPod is necessary there
Muscular pain
I am having been muscular pain since this morning
But I have the pain not many
In this year, when I have started to go to the gym, I had the pain too much
In the result, I couldn't have been able to move for a day
Off cource, I can move today
Because I was used to it
I have to start taking Driving School to get driving license
When college start, I will not have free time much
Introduce myself
I am 19 years-old Japanese

Speaking english is difficult task to me
I think speaking english is different from writing it
When I have to speak english, I cant think up english words easily
and today i registed and installed Skype
I dont have many opportunities to speak english
I want you to help me on term examination of english class
The subject matter is about ''Defference between college and high school life
I have to write it in English on the examination
So, please correct my sentence
First, It became longer time to go to school
In my high school life, It took only 10 minutes to go to my high school on the train
But It takes about 1 hours 30 minutes on the train now
Though I felt little torture at first, I was used to it now
I often have a sleep, read books, listen to musics and study on the way to school on the train
So they are essential for me to go to the college
Second, subjects to study changed
And assignments appearently increased
Because of it, it took longer time to study them except at school
Finally, I came to have to behave more maturely because college students get out into the world in future and so am I
There is a no changed thing for me
It is mental thing
I don't think that my mental age changed
I guess my mind still reamain being high school student
But whenever I experience new things in future, I will be more mature
I think I am on a way to go to real changes
I am busy recently
I started going to the Driving School
There are many younger students like me of DS now
So there is busy
I can't reserve classes of driving skill easily
I could have taken 2 classes
And there also are the classes of subject
I want to get the license soon
Then I want to take my friends to drive somewhere,or some trips
And when I get girlfriend, I wanna drive to trips with her
By the way, I bought a suit for 入学式(an entrance ceremony) of collage the other day
I went to 2 shops of suits
I decided one of them, trying on many suits
So I was satisfied with it
I have to go to the shop in Shinjuku to take my suit
I came to be used to the collage
I made many frineds and we usually have lunch at the dining room in the collage
I really wanna join dance circle soon
By the way, I got the best of all English classes
Thanks to the grade of the test which all students took, I got the best class of English
So I wanna go abroad to study Architecture
I really want to advance my speaking and listening skill
Hair color and cutted
Yesterday, I went to hair salon to color and cut my hair after I exercised at the gym
My hair was changed to mat brown from black
And my front hair was cutted about 3 to 4 cm
A certain person asked me to show new hair of mine
Today I had a plan to go to Tokyo Disney Sea with my friend
Unfortunately I couldn't go there because of heavy wind and rain
But I go there tommorow
I was glad to hear forecaster said tommorow is sunny
Mickey always smile
I was tired today because I have walked for a long time
This story occured for taking my suit which I bought last week
This morning, I went to the driving school
I took 2 classes of subject
This afternoon, I went to the city
At fitst, I went to Shibuya to buy some clothes
I also went to some shops while I went to Harajuku by walking
It was difficult to advance the street
And I took a train of Yamanote Line (山手線) to go to Shinjuku
This is all
I realize this
I want to pronounce English very very well
Japanese can't be adapted to pronounce English
My hardest task is to improve my pronounce
This diary is so short
Yesterday, I went to Harajuku to shop with my friend
But I didn't buy the clothes much
After we finished shopping, I and 2 friends(contain a friend who went shopping with me) went to a local bar
It was PM 9:00
We drunk alcohle there, and we had fun very much
I am not strong against alcohle, so I am early to get drunk
After the bar, we went to カラオケ(Karaoke), getting drink
Besides, we also drunk in カラオケ, hiding drink cans in our clothes
We sang up
Sooooo we had fun
I was home at AM 3:00, then I straightly went to bed
This morning, I went to driving school
I was hard to get up early cause my stomach was still bad
But now OK
I'm happy to have 3 frineds on Skype
I just registered at Skype yesterday
It is little big for me
They are foreigners who are studing Japanese
And they also can speak English
So, we can teach the languages each other
Last day, I talked to one of them
Then I knew that my pronounciation is bad
But I feel glad to have contacted with foreigners
Do you know mixi

Ahaha
Thank you
I'm Japanese junior high school student
I study English
So I study English very hard
I can read many novels
and I don't like nonfiction
It's Japanese writers
I have many theirs books
I am not good at operating electric machines
Three days ago my portable audio player became worng 
It  could not get the music from the stock in my PC
If it is many years ago, we colud bring it to the shop where we had 
bought it
And then it would come back to us being repaired
But in these days I have to send e-mail to the maker and ask them
how I should do to get it repaired
Yesterday they sent back an indication to me but I could not 
PC words are so difficult for me to execute
Surely the world become convenient but it is hard to live in 
In this morning, my son told me that there had been  frost in his
I said to him that it should have not been frost inside the room
我说我的儿子这是不可能有霜冻房间里
I have been busy to attend the Year end Parties this year December
totally different from last year December
I have no time to clean up my house as a Year end Cleaning
In japan, once at the end of the year ,we give a thorough cleaning, 
even to the corners , to our  houses with gratirude and we clean out 
dust and stain during the old year
We cleanse the house and welcom the new year,that is,  the New
Year Gods
We change stream of air fresh around the house
Good atmosphere and good aura charm good and lucky  gods
My died grandmother was a lady who had been born in 1899 , Meiji 
While hearing to ringing 108 times of New Year's Eve Bell, she gets the very first water from the tab to a cup ,and she serves it on the middle of the \"butudan” where is the highest place in the house for her 
After in the morning, she makes each of  us,grandchildren, drink a
mouthful of it , which she calls \"the very first water of the year
For me ,a little child ,that tepid water was even not a thankful thing
However even now it becomes the precious memory
It makes me remember the affection of my grandmother for families 
and the meaning of coming New Year
Do Cleaning up
Tomorrow is the day of putting in an appearance to show our skills in
learning sign language
I made sentences about Helen Keller who had been born as a blind, a 
deaf and a dump
I wonder how she learned that there was an each  word or an each 
name which represented for all the things that she had never seen 
How could she understand the sun and the moon
But I heard that she had even known the abstract words, such as
God who has no visible body and love that can be hard to understand
Every year I write them after I received others' ones
Almost two-third of people giving greeting cards whom I haven't seen 
During the begining  of the year ,we greet each other \"a happy new
Though we haven't meet for a long time ,it is a little bit odd to write 
that please go well with me as well as last year in the greeting card
in Kansai area
In Kanto area it is until Jan
We throw away decorations made of pine tree called \"matu-kazari
We celebrate New Year by welcoming  New Year's Gods at \"大正月
New Year's God  visit our houses by finding pine tree and go into the 
houses and stay beside \"kagami-mochi
We put \"kagami-mochi\" on \"Toko no ma\" where is the  most holly
If it is busy inside the house they will go away, so during three days 
of begining new year ,Jan 1st to 3rd., we housewives don't cook in the 
Each of \"Osechi\" dishes has a meaning  to hope happy life like 
to live  long to have many children  to have a lot of harvest ,etc
In Japan we count our age to add one year when a New Year comes
The ordinary age is called \" 満年齢(mannenrei）\",and we gains one 
Several decade ago, people who worked as a servant to live in the 
shop with owner merchant and his family  could take holiday after 
ending  New Year's period
They return to their hometown where their parents live
It means to go back to the counrty apart from the city
Their holidays are only two days per a year 
On now ,it is forbidden against the law of working rule
We asked the teacher who invented the keyboard
Was it invented by Bill Gates?\"(We also know that is not
A week later ,in the next lesson ,she gave us a paper in which the
story of typewriter being born was written 
typewriter but he sold the right soon to Mr
Densmore made an steady effort to sell the device and finally got  skyrocketed sales
There was also a sentence as following
keys for letters commonly used together to slow down typing to solve the jamming problem
However , when I read that sentence there ,it was not my\" time\" to 
know the alphabets' order on the keyboard is not related to the
frequency of each letter used in English language
I asked her how their salesmen had sold the machines one door to 
another 
I would just try  to make sure whether everyone in US knows this 
story which I had gotten  somewhere and sometimes in my life
I told her that they had explained how to use the machine with one 
word ,and asked her what the word was
We felt a sense of victory in front of defeated teacher
That is why this diarie's title is \"Typewriter\" 
The one special word is typewriter, of which letters are placed on the 
It had been maybe by chance, but it is enough for me to abandon my
After this, the revenge of our teacher had begun about Christmas☆
Recently we talked about the alphabets in English conversation class
Our teacher prepared us the game ,which was to guess the hidding 
words in the sentence and to fill in the blanks
Of course ,my  first suggesting letter is \"e\" 
It is because I have heard that the most frequent using letter in 
English is \"e\" when I was in high school
And maybe the second frequent using word is \"t
I have no confidence because I forgot that my high school teacher 
said  what the second letter had been 
Is it true that there is a  frequency order in alphbets
There is another reason that I choose  the next letter \"t
Why I think so because these \"e\"and \"t \"are settled in the first line 
on the keybord 
And we use our two fingers of left hand,middle finger for \"e\"and 
pointer for \"t
It is more easier  for us to use these two fingers than other two
little  finger and ring finger
Therefore ,\"before the some time\", I thought that the alphabets' order 
on the keyboard is based on the frequency of each letter using
The next word is \"g
There must be \"o\"and \"d\"（＾ｕ＾）
We guessed
After  finishing  3 more games , we won all the games easily
It depends on that other sentences ,which she also prepared for us, 
included full of love and the Bible words
At last the teacher asked us what is the most frequent using word in 
We got confused because we had never think about it before now
Maybe~\"あ\"？？？
We felt a sense of defeat in front of the teacher triumphantly
Last weekend the movie titled  \"Shizumanu Taiyou\" opened to the 
It means that \" the sun which is not dropping
The author treats the crash accident of airplane based on the actual
happening of JAL occured in 1985
I think the title hints  that the time is stopped on that day for the 
bereaved families and never comes next day for them
At that time all the book stores which is related with JAL company 
never put and sold this book series on the storefront
Over 500 people died ,and there included  a lot of children on summer 
is that the baby's skull was found inside one's mother's ribs
Untill the last moment the mother kept hugging and protected her 
How frightened it was  for the children who had been traveling  alone 
Today I was lectured by the professor of Virus at the university
The virus of cold only can combine with the cell of throat and gets into 
human's body
That is, if we swallow or eat the virus of cold, it could not get into the 
body throught the cell of the gullet or the wall of the stomach
So it is very effective that we  block the virus at  the throat and prevent
it from going into the inside
Since now though I have been taught the effect of gargling, I could not 
But when I feel something wrong at my throat, early taking medicine
I wish I could have known this before long
Last Friday at English conversation class,  we talked about tetanus
vaccination with our teacher from Colorado state
She told us children had been vaccinated it every 10 years in U
even after they grew up
In Japan we seldom take vaccinations after growing up
Her father made her take it because she often put off her shoes while 
If she was poked by a nail , there is a risk to become tetanus
While  hearing  her word \"poke\", we all wondered what was happened 
We can't hear the distinction of two
One is a top of the finger and  the other is an iron stick
We said there is no word which represents two different meanings by
same word in Japanese
We replied two words had different Kanji
In the next class I am going to correct it
hello, I want to communication with foreign friends who speak English
Umm, i have a question

My work was software engineer in consumer product farm and I just quit the company, so I'm free now
By now, I have been to
Noth Ameria: US, Canada
I'm thinking to go to Africa or Middle East countries next
I was happy to talk with you last week that I got a new thought from you
I am interesting in “Appreciative Living” that you mentioned
Therefore I try to seek it from the Internet, the link as below
The website shows that we could have our own “appreciative circle”
I am just thinking how I start from this
It shows we do not need expert, experience for this, just need guide book that we can start our own
Is it true
I think it will be worthwhile for our project as well as for my company
I will get book from Amazon and read it first
If I have any problem I will ask you and have short discussion after I read it
Even we can have a book club and invite someone who also interested in this, we can learn and share together
Today, I went to a station in central Tokyo by a subway
A shop at the arrival station was selling rice balls and any kind of them was selling 100 yen
Fixed price \"150 yen\" was written on the price tag
When I bit Onigiri with happy, my tooth was struck by something
It looked a small stone
Shop items sell cheaper than usual with embarrassing reason
Illnesses are worth goodness and badness - For doctors
For example, \"SARS\" is verz bad illness
So they hope for extermination strongly
It makes a good \"customer\" for the doctor
In addition,  the medicine that cures them will not be created
This topic is quotes from the book on famous doctor in Japan \"Takeshi Yoro
I read a book '' tiisakimonoe
It is a form of a letter 
In this leter a man tells his children how he and their mother(his wife) have spent their lives ,and how the mother died 
He expects his children to read this letter after he die
He hopes that his children will live alone 
My favorite sentense is ''Death overwhelmed everything ,and this saved everything
This is a sad story ,but told me  ''whatever happen to you ,you must live
But I'm not good at it, especially listening and speaking
I want to learn English, so I hope you correct my English diary

Two or three years ago, I tried to learn English because it was needed in my job, to communicate with my collegue in abroad
But, in April I moved to another section, and where I seldom use English
Tonight, I found this Lnag-8 sight, and I decided to restart my challenge, learning English 
There are only 3 times that I have been in abroad, but those experience push me to learn English, because to communicate with foreigners is exciting and precious
Perhaps, it will be difficult to write a post everyday, I do my best
Last meeting of the year
We had the last meeting of this year yesterday
So, from today I'm enjoying my New Year's holidays
In the last meeting, we often drink just a cup of juice - there's no alcohol drink, and have some snack and sweets in our office, and enjoy conversation with colleagues
After that, some people go out for alcohol drink, but I often come back home because my family wait my back
In Japan, we usually have Osechi, which is traditional food during the New Year's Holidays
I think there should be traditional New Year's foods in another countries, but unfortunately I don't know
But there are two problems
I had experienced only desk work and a clark of a pet shop
Second,my husband opposes my taking a job
He says that we can live enough by only his income and I will neglect my duty,that is to say housework
Maybe it's sure,but am I living only for housekeeping
I go to golf lesson every Tuesday with my husband
I have practiced for half and a year but I have never played a round on the course(By the way,about short course I have played twice or three times and the scores a that time are about 90
This week I learned the angle of my hands when the head of the shaft is close to the ball
I can't always keep the angle,I mean, my wrists  are stretched
My teacher tells me that many women who play golf were bothered by that because their power is weak
I would like to break myself of this habitas soon as possible and  play a round in this spring
I aim at the score under 100

I was so nurvous when I wait in the waiting room
After I waited there, the colledge student lead me the room where I was interview as a exam
Before today, I practiced so hard but, the interviewer asked me different question
If I'm able to review today's exam time, I want to do again
Today, I went to the school to learn driving
I and my friend were together yesterday but , I was alone
So, I was so nervous
If I'm able to get the licence to drive the car, I want to go shopping
And, I want to drive with my family

B:I will consult our Head Quarters designer today,and I will reply by the day after tomorrow
This month is fall season
I was wake up so cold
My job is a university official staff
The students are working on preparation
English not easy to improve
The second day of the \"unordinary\" weekday has begun
The transportation network in the Tokyo metropolitan region is still paralyzed due to electric power shortage
Many people cannot go to their office, so many shops is closed throughout the day
Every day, many bodies are found at the afflicted area
9,700 people who were missing and thought desperate have been found alive
It is one of few good news for the past few days
And, the fire, which broke out at a nuclear power plant, have been extinguished by working with US armed forces
Japanese citizens would not forget the gratitude for this work
Especially the user interface to correct is excellent
However, I think five-stars system to represent thanking is not good
In my humble opinion, one-star system is more adequate for Lang-8
The reasons is following
 I want to represent maximum thanking to everyone who correct my text
YouTube have stopped the five-stars rating system in the past
One of my hobbies is programming, and I have released some free software(mainly indie games for Windows
Although texts of my games are written in Japanese, it seems that my games are played by some foreign users
As it's very quality, I want to merge it into my game files
I wrote mail text to a patch's author to permit me to do it
Will you please correct following text
iPad for english studing
Today, I will buy a iPad
One of reasons is for studying English
I sometimes read English paperbacks(mainly for children) for studying
However, getting English books is bothering works
Since I search and order books at Amazon, I have to wait arrival of packets for quite a time
By the way, in Japan, the influence of e-Book movement is limited at the present time
How about in the best place of e-Books, English-speaking word
What I said in last diary entry are as follows
 But, a certain English speaker have an opposite opinion
And I received some opinions about it(thanks
I believe that any languages have strict rules, and we can write clear texts in any languages
In the same way, we can write poor writing in any languages
There are many text, which are hard to read and can be interpreted to multiple meaning, all over the world
So, both opinions \"The English language is logical\/illogical\" and \"The Japanese language is logical\/illogical\" are not correct
The important fact is usage of the languages
However, we might say that a certain language's feature urges people to write ambiguous sentences
But, my command of English is too poor to judge which language has this feature strongly, Japanese and English
Mochi is a Japanese word meaning a rice cake
Probably, the word \"sushi\" is comparatively famous
Do native English speaker know the word \"mochi\" as well
An Unordinary Day Has Started
Looks like an ordinary day, but an unordinary day has started
Lifelines has damaged yet
And electricity shortage, due to stopping some power plants, is serious
Yesterday, the government announced rolling blackouts
Staple foods, like rice and bread, is vanished from supermarket and convenience store
This disorder would be continue quite a time
One of these is \"casualty
First, I thought it have meaning which is similar to \"casual
As a matter of fact it means victim or disaster
Do native English speakers not feel out of place about these 2 words
incorrect
He is more tall than she
It's hard for me to use properly -er and more
It seems that there is no clear rule whether or not I should use \"more
In daily conversation, don't native English speakers say as follows
In this case, concatenated sentence gets to be \"He is more tall than she
I wonder if native speakers often say like this, when he cannot speak fluently
Anyway, these are not elegant expressions so much, so these don't appropriate for formal occasions LOL
Many Japanese believe that English language is much more logical than Japanese language
The reasons of it are following
However, I was surprised that a certain English speaker who has very good command of Japanese said \"my impression is opposite
That is to say, Japanese language is logical and have strict rule, English language is not logical
When someone begin to learn foreign language, first of all, he would study the \"rule\" of the language
And then, he would study simple sentences that follow the rule strictly, so he would think like this
He knows slang, illogical rule, incomprehensible expressions of his native language
He would always compare the language and his native language, and believe that the foreign language have strict rule, but his native language is not logical
This is the reason why someone who learn foreign language think his native language is not logical, I think
But, perhaps, he will recognize that the foreign language is as illogical as his native language is, when he master the foreign language
I'm live in tokyo in Japan, and I'm working as a computer engineer
During holydays, I sometimes play analog games with my friends
One of reasons why I'm learning English is to read technical books
I want to read English novels and watch movies without dictionary and subtitle in the future
When I learned an expression \"a lot of\", I thought of following
Do you know Angry Birds
This is a iPhone and Android game
It's not famous very much in Japan, but it seems very popular in the world
The game have got more than 10 million downloads till now
This is Tony-san's comment I received
I first knew the difference between \"house\" and \"home\" a little
It was very unclear for me since I started to study English
I have a feeling that the word \"home\" is wonder
I (and perhaps many Japanese) think of house when I hear \"home
However, it seems that the word \"home\" have much more meaning which is some kind of warm than \"house
Steave Jobs's presentations
It seems that Steave Jobs's presentations is famous around the world
I feel that his speech sounds easy to listen
Do native English speakers also feel that his speech is easy to listen
incomprehensible countable and uncountable nouns
Countable and uncountable nouns are basics of English grammar
But it is so hard to use these nouns properly for Japanese
Because the Japanese language doesn't have the concept that nouns are obviously countable or uncountable
Besides it seems that there are something differences about \"count\" between native English users and native Japanese users
Followings are example of mysteries
I can see that water, beer, information, advice are uncountable
First, I thought it's so easy to understand
it could be considered that objects which have not form are assigned to countable noun
But bread and meat are uncountable
Furthermore, furniture and baggage are uncountable
On the other hand, \"I have *a* headache.\" is a proper English sentence
I don't think we cannot count headache
I have ever had two headaches
I think I have to memorize each of primary English words is countable or not
This is a simple puzzle game, you can play this game casually by one hand
When your game is over, you can see an illustration which draw the fate of the main character
A illustration which you can see depends on your score
if you get score more than 10,000, you can see an illustration 2
I'm going to write a text \"End N\" at the right-lower of the illustrarion
d
I write \"End2\" at the right-lower of the illustration 2
And, I have a question
In this case, do you feel that the expression like \"End 2\" natural
It seems that Japanese is considered as hard language to learning, especially for European and American
On the other hand, Japanese people have generally poor command for English
I think the cause of these two phenomenon is distance between Japanese and European language
This is a article about difficulty to learn language for native English speaker
In such serious situation, one of what I can do is enhance my skill, to 
I have to continue to learn English to gather worldwide information
I'm going to publish not only Japanese version but also English version
note: This diary contains Japanese curse word
Handling curse words properly is very very difficult, especially for non-native Speaker
Of course, it's very difficult for me to handle English curse words for me, but it's very difficult for me to handle Japanese curse words as well
And I was asked by benuaqk-san
This word is very difficult to handle because it seems that THE WORD is used casually until some decades ago in Japan
Before some years ago, a certain old politician caused problem due to using THE WORD
THE WORD is replaced to the other word
As these are old works, it's common occurrence that the author is already gone
As a matter of course, fans of the works don't accept that other person correct the text
Back To The Future\" evokes my good memories of childhood
I watch the movie with my brother and sister avidly
His funny and crazy speech and conduct were amusing me exceedingly
Biff Tannen was a fucking nice villain
He formed typical type of \"jock\" in my image
I sometimes watch the movie, and it is amusing supremely even now
By the way, the stage of \"Back To The Future 2\" is 2015, 3 years later from now
It seems that flying cars will not realize
But some of \"future items\" within the movie are now existing
Furthermore, one of problems about curse words is these are famous amoung non-native speakes
This is wikipedia article about English dirty which we don't use unnecessarily
But, I hear these word very often in Hollywood movies
Short and catchy word tend to get to be curse word, so curse words are so easy to remember
But we haven't use these word casually
meaning of \"bugging out
I have a feeling that I sometimes see characters who can't speak English on American fictional story
For example, there are two boys who can't speak English on the movie \"The Bad News Bears
This is some old example(1976
And as comparatively new example, I can pick Tuck and Roll who are Hungarian twin woodlouse on \"A Bug's Life\"(1998
Is there an original old character of this type of characters
It seems that it is the 5th biggest earthquate sinth 1900
I was at work in the office then, and the shake was too big to stand up
As my family was all safe, I was relieved
push to resume
I'm developing a game for iPhone
I'm going to write a message \"push to resume!\" on pause screen
I have started facebook
I will start to use it to communicate world wide people
In Japan, facebook is not popular very much, because mixi, which is SNS in Japan, have already used widely
But recently, some people(mainly early adapters) have begun facebook as well in Japan
childish spoken English
In the game, there is a character who is very young girl
I have finished my meal, of which my I don't like, too
I didn't cry when the injection
Mam, are you gonnna go yet
Come tommorow, too
Today I will write about expensive sushi, so called \"no-rounded sushi\".(*1
For example, some Japanese eat sushi at New Year or year-end party
Because we have a sense of luxury for sushi
In this kind of sushi is comparatively expensive
We sometimes call this kind of sushi \"rounded sushi\".(*2
It is typical sushi which is not expensive
Here are one more examples
It contains many illustrations of plant, but most plants doesn't exist in this world
Furthermore, it was written in UNKNOWN language
Few days ago, I heard the news that it was identified when it was made by using radiocarbon dating
It was written in early 14th century
I feel this mystery very exciting
But some people says this book is just bullshit
I think it will remain mystery forever, and it should be
I am so bothered Whenever I often try to emphasize my sentences
Because there are countless ways to emphasize sentences
It's such tasty
I think \"so\" is a so easy-to-use adverb
It's so easy to type, easy to speak
fucking\" is a fucking indecency word
It's fucking terrible that you use the adverb frequently especially during meal time
A article, illustrate Japanese curry as drugs, become a popular topic around some people in Japan as a reason for it's excessive sensational expression and love for curry
Chris Kohler, an author of this article, is a reporter of video game
But he sometimes write articles about curry because of his curry addict
Later, a offline meating was held with fans of the article and him(of course, at the curry shop
They seemed to enjoy to talke about the curry and the video games, and the meetig will be held next year
He said \"That article for USA people, but seems to be popular only in Japanese people
Following is the sight at that time
There are many (offline) English conversation schools, and I guess these are valuable for many people
However schools costs me very much
I have to pay about 30,000 yen as matriculation fee, and several tens of thousand yen per month if I go to English conversation school
Online English conversation school generally use skype
I can learn English conversation at home, and it costs me only 3,000 - 5,000 yen per month
Furthermore I can save time of commuting to school
There were full of terrible hardship behind their unbelievable success today, especially before they had finished their first long movie \"TOY STORY
At that time, Pixar hadn't developed the full-length movie, and they ware novices at scenario
As you know, \"TOY STORY\" achieved awesome success, and thereafter Pixar was going on making splendid movies
I think one of important reasons about their success is their attitude of emphasizing the story
TOY STORY\" was the world-first long movie made with computer graphics only
This can be the big reason of this movie to be marketable
Nevertheless, they had no conceit, and they thought the following
The most important thing of the movie is story
 ice cream soad
These are very popular sweet things in Japan
Do you think these can be seen as sweet stuffs for non-Japanese people
Kashiwa mochi is Japanese sweet cake wrapped in a leaf
Because I sometimes sore throat, and my friends who came to my home keep dripping nasal mucus
This air cleaner is selled about 30,000 yen at electric appliance store
However I could buy the air cleaner about 20,000 yen at Inernet retail shop
My native language is Japanese, and I was often surprised at Japanese diary in Lang8
IMHO, although many diaries are manufactured by native Japanese speaker in SNS and blog every day, almost of those are useless except for oneself
However, diaries in Lang8 written by non-native Japanese speaker is much interesting
Of course, these diaries contain grammatical mistake due to written by non-native speaker, but there are more interesting than general diary written by native Japanese, I think
I think reasons of this phenomenon are following
 People who learn foreign language have desire to improve oneself
 So, there is a tendency that they have good writing skill(in one's native language
 Good logical structure of text is independent of language and common to the whole world
If the noun is a human or an animal or time, you don't have to use \"of\", but possessive
The keyboard of the computer
After I studied above mentioned, I googled in English
And then, I found many English expressions such as following
Although real cars is consist of hard iron, this movie portrays many personificate cars as soft and cute
The story of \"Cars\" is based on the real American road \"Route66\", which was abandoed due to new  interstate highway
Route66 is not familiar among Japanese, but I could feel sadness of people sliped into obscurity
This is sequel of this
I was asked about inexpensive course fee of English conversation school, so I'm going to write about it
English conversation schools which I know are following
I picked up fees of most basic course
It seems that every day I can take a class which takes 25 minutes
I think the most big reason of such a low rate is low personnel expenses caused by nationality of lecturers
personnel expenses directly related to fee of one-to-one lesson of language study
Though I don't have friends which learn at online English conversation school, so I don't know the quality of the lessons
I'm going to write a diary when I will take a online English conversation class
I'm developing an iPhone puzzle game, and I'm considering about the English title of this game
I think it doesn't make sense to you, but it's no problem
But if you feel it's hard to remember, it's huge issue
I followed a certain technique to name a product
The technique teach me that it combines a popular word and an alien word
mochi is a Japanese word meaning sticky rice cake
The theme of this game is food and sweets
It is difficult for me to handle tense because I cannot judge my sentence whether correct or not
I want to clean my room before he comes back
My daily life is getting ordinary little by little
The day, when the big earthquake was happened, is just 12 days ago
My daily life is getting ordinary little by little
The journey to the reconstruction of the location of the disaster wouldn't be easy
I'm going to make my humble contribution
I have registered premium account
I have registered premium account
The reasons why I registered is as follows
 I will study harder if I paid money, even though it's little money
 The fee of premium is 5$, and recently, the yes is stronger against the dollar
Dou you know Engrish
Engrish is funny English expressin by no native English user, especially by Japanese
All your base are blong to us'(AYBABTU) is one of the most famous and popular Engrish expression especially amang the Internet users
AYBABTU's first appearance is in 'Zero Wing', which is english version of Japanese video game
Afterward, this phrase is used with romp all over(ex:youtube
Although I can recognize this phrase involves grammatical mistakes(such as mistake of abount plural form), but I can't feel this sentence such strange and funny
Perhaps, only native English users can feel AYBABTU is ridiculous
Do you memorize words of foreign language by using word book
I often do so, but I forget words soon every time
For example, I wrote diary about the word \"casualty\" before
It is generally believed that Japanese language doesn't have articles
Today I will review about usage of articles
I visited a town which is famous as a hot spring resort
The town of this sentence is a one of famous towns
In this case, a famous town exists only this one
In addition, a word \"article\" itself is puzzling too
Whenever I see this word, I interpret as newspaper article
I was pointed out this at a comment of yesterday's diary
I first knew the word \"curse word
I think there is some kind of gap between Japanese and English about dirty words
However, the Japanese word which is direct translated from \"crazy\" is considered as a taboo word (especially on TV
A few months ago, the serialization in 6 yeas was finished
The story was beginning in 1629, at the stage of the showdown between Fujiki Gennosuki and Irako Seigen
They were so strong swordmans
The defeat means death
But Fujiki had only one arm
And Irako who is rival of Fujiki was blind
And beside them, there were two women
Each one believed the victory of her partner
And then, the story go back to the some years ago
The story portrays deliberately their meeting, and what happened to them from then on
The work is noted for intensity of cruel graphic and deep theme
As I don't know the difference between \"x-one\" and \"x-body\", I will study
It seems that \"x-body\" is more colloquial than \"x-one\", but these are basically same meaning
Does anybody know where is my wallet
Does anyone know where is my wallet
Did somebody come home when I was away
Did someone come home when I was away
Please point out if these are unnatural sentences
It's hard for non-native English speaker to handle polite English expression
I'm studying basic of polite expression
This is (perhaps) collect English, but such a curt expression
These are a little polite, but have direct nuance yet
It seems that this is somewhat polite
This is euph and polite
It appears that the amount of donation reached about 10,000,000,000 yen each from America and Taiwan, for the damage of Japan's 311 earthquake
Such incredibly big money was donated as their goodwill
Now Japan is certainly exhausted
Before very long, we will reconstruct, and return a favor to them
I thought of the following
But, native English speakers never say \"keyboard of computer
In this case, a correct English expression is \"computer's keyboard
Furthermore, more natural expression is \"computer keyboard
And, \"son of him\" and \"newspaper of yesterday\" are correct English expressions
A newbie, not limited in English, tend to just learn existing rules or patterns
Consequently, sometimes he gets to be a man who doesn't think himself
It makes a newbie to think and feel by himself
Japanese calls musician \"artist
Don't you think strange
Or is this right answer
I imaged \"artist\" is painter or sculptor

In fact, all the countries have it
Many reasons for people in each country need music
Firstly, people used musical to play for respect god or anything else that they respect; spirits, nature and etc., they thought song will make that satisfy and bless them to happy life
Although, we play it at church now
Next, music can influence people to enjoy and have energy, therefore musicians played it in events, festivals and parties
Finally, some music can relieve stress, so it is brought to heal and knows as music therapy, which can hear in hospital, school or home
In the other hand, music can divide in 2 parts; traditional music and international music
Traditional music is identify country music that people can know where are songs from
Unlike, international music is music that accepts all over the world
Some countries, traditional music is less play in present than the past and difficult to hear
In conclusions, we need music to play for respect Jesus, enjoy in events and therapy
In addition, we should to keep traditional music before it will lose because it is important due to it is identity in each country more than international music that can hear in many country

What do you think is the most important : motivation, working a little everyday, methods
In my case, I've been studying english for so long now (and without motivation) that I've piled up bad habits and I'm trying to get rid of them
I've begun to learn it seriously few months ago
I've realised that I have a strong writtencomprehension but I'm weak in expressing myself
Today I learnt a very dispointing news
Well, I'm a big fan of James Bond movies and I heard that the latest movie was just cancelled because of a lack of money

I'm so exciting to find this website
I'm an outgoing girl who have great fun to dance,sing,travel and make friends and so on
To be honest,I personally feel that japanese is more difficult for me to learn
 When we learn language, we should read more, speak more, listen from time to time and writing every day

Two days ago, the richest Chinese millionaire came to Taiwan and he prepared seventeen million dollars to dole out it to the poor Taiwanese
Because of the sensitive politics between Taiwan and China, his behavior got some dispute
Some people argue his behavior is too lofty and it harms Taiwanese degnity; in fact, they think Taiwanese are not beggar and do not need a hypocritical charity

It was not thought that the aftershock came to such a distant place though there was no big damage because it was away
I not surprised am scared for the earthquake of about four in the seismic intensity
It updates it because the Internet is not connected in the place for the move, and it returned to local once
It ties on May 6 and it restarts
Italian is studied at the school now
It is because of going in the winter of this year to Italy

TO DAY
I went to food shop \"OKONOMIYAKI\" 
After one hour's drive, I got to the railway station and found him
I had a good sleep
I did not get up until 2came to my dorm and woke me up at 11:00 p.m
After a sumptuous lunch with my friends, I had my hair trimmed (I am much cooler now
That black tiled floor is so well cleaned that I can even see my reflection in it
Then I stepped on the well-cleaned floor and found out it was a pool
It is the birthday of one of my colleagues today
He is also my roommate
But he did not tell me that today was his birthday and just hanged out with his friends
I think he did not tell me maybe because it is not quite proper for me, a stranger to most of his friends in his department, to go with them
I am not angry because I understand
But there are many occasions like this, even in my own life
Why do my boss always criticize me
 Maybe it is because I ate too many bananas, corns, and cucumbers
That is so coooooool
I have been learning English for many years, maybe 14 years, started when I was a kid in primary school
I am a little ashamed that I failed to manage this language
Today l start LANG8
But I want study English
Because ,I work at very famouse hotel
So many gest come my hotel from all over the world
Somebody,please correct my poor English sentence
Now, I am studying English language course at Victor University in Melbourne
Welcome everyone to change my mistake or grammar
If some people whose like learning chinese, we can help each other
Aslo, people who like travelling to go to China, you can ask me and I will proivde some interesting place for you
but I'm living in London now
I'll being to live London 1year and half
and I'm going Reading festivan for listen to Radiohead
I like joke and Im funny, I think
By the way, Im going to go NY next Feb to April, so, where is your recommended place
Please give me your idea
Then, I was in Canada(Vancouver) during last August
I could make many foreign friends
Now, I wanna more foreign friends
I dont mind your age, sex, and nationality
If you wanna learn Japanese or about Japan, Ill teach you
lets talk with me
This is Japanese popular animation
The new story starts at this spring in Japan
albite
I did from twelve o'clock at midnight to six o'clock in the morning yesterday
I was glad a burglar didn't come there yesterday
If he came there,I would desperately ran away
I' m going on a bus
Too long
I 'm afraid that I will be exhausted
I have recently practiced a new way of studying English to improve Japanese accent
WBC (world baseball classic) is taking place tomorrow in Japan
But,there are something I'm worrying about
Ichiro is not in good conditions
I'm taka
I'm staying in Ireland to study English now
I had a account of Lang-8 but I forgot my password
So I made it again
My university started last monday and some clubs also did
I was looking forward to starting it during summer holiday
However I'm bored at weekend
I dont have something to do
to be Christmas
In Korea, I used to enjoy christmas going shopping or karaoke  with my friends, but now I have no idea how to spend and enjoy x-mas in Canada
How do Canadians enjoy christmas
I think having a practice in writing in English must be helpful to improve written skill
I've sometimes tried to write an essay, but I always hestitated what topic i should take
So now I wanna ask you guys who are in same case as mine
How do you choose a certain topic for writing as a practice
Which one made you be able to have an interest in
tAlong with the development of the Internet, seldom people have the habit of keeping a diary
People often communicate with others through a variety of communication mediums, but they seldom have time staying alone thinking or writing
They forget one most important friend: themselves
How to be a loyal friend to yourself
Talk to yourself in your diary honestly
Prevention (1992, p.47) suggested 21 ways to staying up in down times
I read about old friends, and places that were once home for me, and often must read five or six times before I can recall them clearly.” Keeping our past in mind is important because I believe everyone values his\/her past life, or we do not need our memory and we will be like a piece of blank paper before die
When we read them several years later, we may recollect the houses we used to live in, the friends we used to be intimated with and the social environment at that time
The second thing we write on our diaries is our thoughts and feelings
It is fun when we look back our sort of childish thoughts when we were young
However we do not look down on them for we know that is how we have shaped our temperament now and maybe we will laugh at what we are thinking now in several years later
Then they chose  hot majors according to their parents’ suggestions and then attend universities, in which the same major’s students’ classes are also exactly the same no matter they like it or not
Those innate traits will not change throughout our life, thus we can be sure what career we should have in the future instead of following the current trend which probably not suit us
It`s long time I was here last time
≧ω≦*) Many things have happend: I had finished my first year in University and had taken the academic vacation
But I desided to pass examinations once again and to try to enter the other facultet where I can study Japanese
I want to do my best to make my dream come true
S.: I`d like to say \"Welcome!\" to all my new friends
It`s very interesting for me and in spite of some difficulties I very like that language
After the college entrance examination,I have 2 month left before going to the college

I had a test of vietnamese today
I made all sentences correct but the intonations that were 6 types were totally wrong
I just whispered to me that it's unbelievable
I thought all i wrote were right
Red marks on the page were like blood when i saw them
Vietnamese teacher said you're not so bad as i thought
what
I felt i was getting happy with that despite what he said like
I spread the books to study as soon as i got back home
As times pass by, My eyes went down the table below
I tried to wake up hardly, spanking my face harshly
After an hour i've got beet root face and I got into sleeping after all
Now, i got up and writing this

I'm really interested in learning English
Bilinguistical person

At the end of the day, smartphone can provide it for you
But it costs $100 a day
Have you ever read '1984' written by G
owell
Or guess what it is
Why not it is Big mama
It is focused on the men has got power
What can you imagine world will come after era of smartphone is gone
The future i scared
I heard from one of my friends about our future
We plan to go to Vietnam to get a job that is related to the field of trading product in Kor
We have to make a lot of firends when we've done those things because we could get more information on vietnamese culture
He really sure that we can make most of it
But there is one thing we should be carefull is to care of us each other
drink too much, smoke a lot, hook up a girl, go to the club alone even though it is out of mere freak
Of course i'll
I come up with something scared
that is what i am
My will is too weak to hold the oath(swear?) tightly
I LIKE Haging around people who like them
Do you believe in UFO
Nowadays, Whether alien exists or not is rising on hot issue
Because NASA announced that the creature we never can image could be alive somewhere in the universe
But I don't think UFO does exist somewhere i know
It's because that human beings are right alien
Here is the story i want to speak out
There were the only one type of alien in small universe hundreds of thousands of millions of year ago
That's right it was origin human I'm gonna tell
However, the human was just tiny little very small thing like fly ruber at the moment
The bigger time was, the more bigger universe was
This is rihgt the big bang theory ( I like soap opera
though
By the time the earth came out from dark dust in chaos, the sun which came out earlier than the earth had been becoming hot
some residents living in the sun evacuated with elasticity they had.(They could get to the earth because the distance was't far between them
Think
the usniverse -Times- was just born in a few years.) They eventually settled down on the earth without any danger
And they tried to get used to new circumstances which was the same as the sun at that time
As time passed, They become a dog, mices, cocoroaches,  and human
Thank you for readin 'FANCY world.' 
I don't smoke
Do you think smoking is a popular way for people to ease their stress
Smoking just makes smokers think they felt released
Actually they don't feel they are getting addictive by nicotine
What does government do for them
Raising a tobacco's price
What cigarette cost jump is to make the poor and smokers light up special cigar imported from somewhere like cuba
If the cigar price increase up to the imported one
They will choose the one came from exotic country
On the contrary, It's so ironic that they will try to work hard more
They might as well do
They will want an expensive one
The more the price is up, the more Gov's pocket is gonna be full
In short, Don't smoke and get your fresh air
Government wants to be the rich
We should be the rich
Especially when I see somebodies are studying Chinese
I hope I can increase my lingual skills with you here

For example, if they can’t cut costs or lay off when they have poor results, they will go bankrupt
By contrast, When they have good performances, they will need more workers
In Japan, many large cooperatinos start to give up a lifetime employment system now because they begin to realize the system is irrational
Secondly, it is hard to maintain workers’ motivations when they are hired for their entire lives
If companies promise emplyees to be employed until the retirement age
In Japan,  the gorverment-managed railway comapany had reported a huge loss every year
In those days, it had ensured a lifetime employment
By contrast, they work hard if they have a possibility to be laid off
The Japan railway company has made big profits since it was privatized because employees have a probability to be fired and devote themselves to thier work
It has recently been anounced that a new movie theater may be built in your neighborfood
I agree that a new movie theater is built in my neighborhood, though some people say that it would be a bad thing

Many old people live alone in our town
A movie which they watch would be one of common topics
It will relax you

I finished my web conversation with my best friend in Hong Kong just now
I missed her very much
I gained many in New York, but lost many in the same time
Seems the boundaries between us are not Jet Lag only
But being in New York, possitive thinking is better for me
I gained better english, and the difficulties matured me
Don't know what will be happened next year
Today is a nice day

Life was like a box of chocolates

Here we pay about 300,000 yen(3,200US$) to get a license for driving usual cars

Then, talking of sickness, what is said to make you get better when you are sick in where you live
Whenever I got sick, I am forced to have gingers, by the way
It's been so long since the last entry
Please think of it as a writing training
Here we go
I have no doubt I have a Japanese accent in English
I cannot but speak in that way whether or not I prefer it without magical trainings
Honestly, I don't want to be using such a strong accent that some people might not understand what I just said
Then, should I pursue a fluency in the Standard English
True, it is not waste of time to put my goal to become fluent in the language
However,  concentrating on one less significant thing about a language(at least for people unable to make themselves understood smoothly with it) just wears you out, especially when you are still not there in the language
Thus, I should rather put energy into gaining correct pronunciations which are legible to others
Today I enjoyed karaoke with some friends
I really like singing though my voice is far from comfortable
our house is now being built
I attached some pictures so you can see how it is going for now
Be careful when you have red wine by the way

Anyways, I really appreciate you taking your time for this article
I just wanted to tell you (if any) that I am available now
Send me messages, and force me to correct your Japanese
I know in English language, you use \"it\", \"these\" or \"him\" when you have talked about it in the close context
Let's posit the premise that a country \"The ABC KINGDOM\" would exist in this world

Also, I'd really like to go to a Ghibli exhibition which is held in Geijutsu no Mori right now
You can take a picture on Totoro

Therefore DSi which I bought is amazing

I joined this website that one of my friends recommended yesterday
I could find some korean who  had already joined to study English like me
and I felt excited to see someond's correction
when one person wrote her diary in this site, the others living in other county corrected it
it seems to me that this way is a very wonderful idea for writing
The following is My first writing at \"Lang-8
This is the sentence of my profile at \"Lang-8
I study both English and Chinese as foreign languages, and it is English that I mainly study
So, I am studying English mainly at \"Lang-8
I write a journal on Lang-8 for the first time in ages
But, not that I have been writing some of them on other sites
Hi, I haven't seen you for long time
A reason that I haven't been writing some journals is that I have been waiting for some corrections of my previous journal and I haven't keep up with the pace of writing journals on Lang-8 because of a long sentence of my previous journal
Also, I thinked it was because of it and it was a little rigid sentence that they wasn't corrected
All right, if I am in a position who correct my long journal, there is something which makes me depressed somewhat
I'm going to write a little short sentence
Thank you for coming our salon few days ago

We are supporting for japanese company,when They will go to Australia
Looking for tenant,Marketing, Promotion, etc
We will  intoroduce to you in this friday, in this case as well
We hope to obtain the cooperation of your company
For exemple, Our coustamer paid to you amont of maney
We`d like to includ this time
A typically case of using \"っ“, It's used when you want to say something verb as the past
For example 'いう'(means 'say') is present behavior, and if you want to say as not present but past, replace last character to 'た',  so 'いう' is converted to 'いた
In addition, sometimes add 'っ' before 'た', as a result it'll be 'いった
I'm not sure the rule when it should be added 'っ', but i guess that there is only way to remember pattern as each verb if it's added 'っ' like a English verb which can't have 'ed
Of course I'm not teacher so this might not be correct explanation
Several days before，I had drived to Jianyang——a same city of Sichuan, just for business

It makes more relax my body than when I don't use
Maybe It just my imagination

I bought two shoes in Yokohama today
It's a very rare situation
That's because my foot size is too big for japanese
A lot of japanese woman needs the small size shoes about 23\/23.5\/24 cm, but my foot is 24.5-25 cm
So, i almost can't find a shoes fit my foots in Japan
I always buy shoes the imported one or when i travel in Europa

Yesterday, one of my friends' facebook friends sent me a msg, and surprisingly, he was my friend's boy friend, and according to what she said, they were not going well
She was surprized by that he sent me a message, and asked me to erase him from my facebook friend
Is she jealous of that he's interested in other people
It's no matter to erase him, but I don't feel clear
I think waht someone have interest about other is natural and usual, but if she doesn't like that he is interested in others, she won't be in good with him
It especially looks like that men in America tend to contact easier than ones in Japan
Actually, is it right???本当はどうなんだろう？？？
but I'm going to work hard to write it
Give my regards to you
I sometimes make some dumplings called gyoza for dinner
In that case, I buy their skins at a grocery store instead of making them from scratch
The product's name is 'Won Ton Wraps' not 'Gyoza Skin
The product that I usually use is American one, and I don't know the reason why they are tastier than Japanese one though, they surely are
Maybe, they have less additivees
I prefer American taste to Japanese taste, but as for the amount, I prefer Japanese one
Japanese skin is usually selled by 30, on the other hand American wrap is selled by at least 50 to 60
If you want to buy 10 wraps, you have to buy 50 wraps
I've bought them some days ago, and I made some gyoza with about one out of three(1\/3) of a whole product; so I have alot of wraps now
According to the recipe of their webcite, this can be something like pie
The Darkness Of Bus
The bus is not on time so much,but it's reasonable and convenient,so I like it
But there is alone point I care
In the night,it's almost utter dark inside the bus
Due to the darkness,I've lost my knit gloves in the bus
It's new and I like them very much,so I'm sad
Some friends came over my house,so I made some dishes
When I was prepareing dishes,the fire alarm was starting to go off
The sound was so loud,and I was very surprized by it
The alarm didn't quit immediately,so I stoped cooking and called concierge to know what happened
I was relieved and rresumed cooking
But!There were a trouble I hadn't noticed
When the alarm was going off I was making a Spanish omelet,and the bottom of it was barned
So,I removed the brown part and made it quiche with an extra egg and cheese
With much trouble,finally,it was tasty
I was happy to hear the everyone said it was great
According to her, there is a bacon-flavored floss
The shop also has a lot of other flavor!!さらにお店にはほかにもたくさんのフレーバーが！
Interesting though, I won't try the bacon one
Difference Of The Country
I arrived at New Jersey at Aug\/22\/09
Comparatively I'm used to American life,but I'm not used to American unit
For example,I toasted a slice of bread with oven this morning,it was burned because of high temperature
It is used F in America,it's used ℃ in Japan
We went to Brooklyn Botanic Garden last Sunday for cherry bloosam viewing
The festival called 'Sakura matusri' was held there and there were some special performance and exhibition there
I'm not sure about the reason why I attracted by Bonsai, but I was especially attracted by the Bonsai exbition
My favorite one was a big tree in bonsai with a lot of small pink flower, but every piece of work looked gorgeous
Actually I have never thought that before, and far from that I thought that bonsai was too quiet, so I was surprised by me
Bonsai is enjoyed by rather elderly people in Japan, so I wonder I've got old enough to enjoy it
I've taken group English conversation lesson once a week, and the teacher always prepare some interesting article or topic that promote our conversation
It was really funny and interesting question that she asked us a few weeks ago; if you were thanksgiving food, what were you
Turkey, stuffing, mushed potato, corn, cranberry or pumpkin pie
Every student pick up one for yourself and one for other students, we are group of 4, and gave us a good reason why you chose your answer
If you had been there, what did you pick for you
brownies
I made brownies in order to give to may husband and some friends yesterday
I made them in Japanese recepi with American ingrediients
But sudly the brownies  were not good
I think there's a difference between Japaneese chocolate and American one in how much sweet
And moreover I think I baked too much
From now on I'm going to cook them again with watching out the oven and other recipe
I  hope it will be tasty next time
Milk chocolate and peanuts butter spread on the dough, some banana slicees on it and topped with a lot of marshmallow
And its taste was great
Its melting marshmallow was espesially excellent
The final exam is around cornaer
At the beginning of this session, I didn't think that one month was short and much time left in this session, but now I think it has been short because of you and classmates
When I can't speak what I think I feel terrible, and sometimes feel depressed and do not feel like going to class
However once enter the class, I used to find that class was surely good
It have passed for 4 days since coming new year,but it's my first journal of 2010
At new year's eve,I and my husband had joined a running festival called \"Emerald Midnight run\" at central park in Manhattan
On that day,it was snow,so I wondered if it carryed out,but it did
If we missed the bus, there was no way to getting home until next morning,we gave up the whole distance and planned to stop the run when we reatched the half distance
There were a band performance and a costume contest before running,they were very entertaining
At 12:00,there were fireworks above my head,they were amazing
I want to join it again and run completely
Yesterday flossing my teeth,my cavity filling was off
So I have to go to dentist
Being lucky,I could make the reservation for tomorrow
But I don't like dentists as manay people don't like it
Going out buildings,I felt chilly
In there, there were some people wearing down jaket,some people wearing t-shut
I wonder if he felt chilly
Last Thursday, we had a heavy snow
In spite of the snow, I had some things to do that day; going to the dentist, going to my school,  visiting my friend's home, taking a seminor of English pronunciation.(oh, what many things there're
At the day, I was actually busy, but it turned out to be really funny
After seminior, during my friends and I took a walk in the heavy snow(it was alomost storm, and my umbrella was broken><), I felt just like we were in our school days
I dont't know what made me like that, it was like a magic
The Cat's Recent Action
It has been almost a month since we began to take care of one of our friend's cat while she is out
Even though I think she asks a little bit too much feed, everything has been good
she really has a good appetite
She seems to become familiar with us; Especially with me, She looks familiar with me more than my husband
Actually she is on my lap now
Btw, she has taken interesting action these days
After eating feed, a short time later she gets on a washstand and looks at herself into the mirror crying
I go to school to study English and we students discuss about many article at the class; education, health insurance system, natural disaster and how to recover
I'm a kind of nurvas, because the next is supposed to be by me
I've decided the article, but haven't done the preparation for the presentation
I've been interested in the special shoes which make daily walking into a sort of excersize, like puma body train, sckechers' shape ups and reebok easytone
I found and tried some of sckechers and some of reebok
One of them felt like walking on the sand, and one of others felt like being pulled from the top
The information on the ad about these shoes looked really work, but I had no idea about it really, really worked
I have wonderd whether these shoues I tried yesterday didn't fit me
If you have tried or used these shoues, could you share your thought or experience
One of my friends is chef, and  we had nice dinner at the restaurant that he recomended
The restaurant was really great, its drink, food and atmosphere was totally amazing
It was really surprised of me to had missed to get off the bus, even though it was the lst bus of a day
It really screced me!>< 
Thomas, US Virgin Island
I enjoyed snorkeling there
This program is one of official programs of NYCity in order to meet children difference coultures
Because the area we're going is a little far from my house and I have been busy recently, so I haven't done this work for several months
It have been very cold recently in NY
It's my first time to be in NY in winter,and I didn't know so cold
It's such cold that I want to go to a hot spring,especially Japnanese style's one,or a Swedish sauna
I really want to take it,and I feel hot
One of my friends is sent to the damaged area in Japan by her company for relief effirts of the earthquake
She has a cat and she asked me to take care of her cat during her absence, so  my husband and I began taking care of her cat
But soon it turned out very good and fun to have a cat because she is so friendly and cute, and she get us to wake up with her crying in the early morning
I've got driving lesson in New Jersey
I've got a international driver's license in Japan before coming the US,but I didn't drive a car in Japan,so I've taken the lesson
In Japan,driving lesson has many hours to drive on road including expressway
In the US,there are less hours to drive at driving school,is it possible to have a lesson on expressway if you want
Last weekend,I was going to go to Manhattan for some shopping and eating pizza with my husband
The pizzeria that we was saupposed to go is really nice,so I was looking forward to visiting there
But,due to his cold,I couldn't get there
So,since the last night,I've been going to eat the pizza
His cold is getting better,then I'm going there this weekend
The Stores Were Closed On Sundays
Yeserday I went IKEA in New Jersey by my car with my husband
The roads to IKEA is complicated for me,so I got there with much trouble
There were no car at the parking,so we felt strange.(Usually it is very croeded
And the entrance was closed with opening hours information'Mon
It was no help to do,we unwillingly went back to home
In Japan almost shops and department store are opening on Sundays,so it was unexpected  that IKEA dosn't open on Sundays
We felt acually differences between the countries
According to weather reports,tomorrow will be rainny and snowy
I wish it won't be rainy or snowy
I washed my jeans with washing machine yesterday and I tried to wear these this morning
To my surprise, I found it too tight
At first I thought it shrunk, but thought back a secound, I wondered if I gained weight
Anyway, I'm having a trouble not wearing it comfortably
I like cooking,but these days I don't feel like cooking.(I have no idea for it
I don't like feeling doing loundry either
I don't feel like doing chores,but there are nobody doing these,so I do
I especially have trouble with to decide the menu about cooking
Today's entry is the one continued from yesterday
I cooked brownies using a other recipi from before.(Sadly the one I made before was not tasty
Though I had been nervous until I sampled it,this one was better then before
I was relieved to make this,and I tryed previous one again
I was surprized,it turn to tasty
Actually it was bitter,but it was also rich,and it was great with ice cream and some fruits,so if I serve to a friend,I do in such way
I'm giving it to friend tomorrow and I'm wondering which brownies I give to friend.(For my husband,I gave both with nuts ice cream and some fruits on valentain's day
I'm into veggie and fruits juice these days
There's a nice tiny sandwich shop near my school and they serve a lot of veggies and fruits juice and fresh smoothies, so I wanted to make it by myself
Following the shop's recipe, I put pear, celory and spinach
I preffer eating them by nature
The NewYork's Bagle
A few days before,I ate a bagle sold in Manhattan
It has been a month and 2weeks since I moved to New Jersey,but it was the first time I eat it
In Japan,I like bagles and I used to eat bagles,but NewYork's bagles 
are quite different from Japanese one
Especially,I was surprised the height
But I like both of them
An Advice about How to Improve English
I got some advice about how to improving English, especially listening, from my teacher today
The means is so simple
Though it has passed only a day, it seems helpful
After I got advised, this means is so reasonable and natural, but I didn't do it before
Even though I have rather slender figure and my chin is sharp, I'm conscious of my face line
Also I'm conscious of the highness of cheekbones
Do you know any good way to improve the face line
One of what I like about the U.S.A. アメリカの好きなところのひとつ
One of what I like about the U
S., there is usually sort of sale at shomwhere in a shop even without particular sale season
I can enjoy sale price though a year
I have a friend who want to talk to
Though I don't know why, I got a energy from him
So I wanna talk to him more and hope I have some chances of talking
Nice Resturant
I also have some favorite resturant in Manhattan, though there are so many nice resturants to visit there; it is French one
My husband and I have visited there twice for this fall, its amazing and beautiful dishes always surprized us
But, there is only thing that I am disappointed by the resturant
I really really like all their dishes, but I don't like their desserts very much
I think they are not flavorful enough
I wish they would serve the dessert that fit my taste
Since coming here NJ which is a 15-minute bus ride from Manhattan, I'm into the way of cook for vegetarian
I don't know the clear reason, but maybe because I can see more cafes, resturants and grossery stores for vegetarian and other heathy diet in here than in Japan
My hasband loves meat, especially beef, and wants to have any meat including fish for every dinner, so picking up a menu for meal is troublesome
At the party I talked with a friend  who is charged in ecology
He is a leader of the community,and he knows very wall about ecology
I'm interesed in ecology,ecological movement and organic food,so we enjoyed talking 
In the talking,I heard a interesting thing
Before,I thought organic food is good for only ME eating them,but it's not right
The reason is that not using farm chemicals is good for their halth
I was so releaved to hear that
I'm chosing the organic food
I was sometimes given hugs by my friends from not Japan these days
There isn't this custom in Japan, so I didn't understand what makes people give hugs each other, but recently I understood the meaning in my way when I was actually given it
In my opinion, people want to express their feelings and thoughts that they can't express in words
Because in my case, after enjoying to talk and when we had to say good-bye, I wanted to express my feeling somehow and used body language 'hug', insted of we couldn't understand as exactly as we thought
What do you think about this?What makes you give hug
Lastweek,from Tuesday to Friday,my friend  had visited my house in NewJersey near Manhattan from Japan
It was the first time for her to visit Manhattan,we did sightseeing for three days
Espesially,broadway musical,'The Phantom Of The Opera' was fantastic
The acting,the singing,the stage settings are above the word
Buying the CD(highlight of musical),Ilistened to it
It's snowy today,not just snow,it's snow storm
A wether reporter has reported it for a week 
Actually,on last Satursday,though it was expected to snow,it wasn't snowy
So I didn't care about it completely,and I invited some friends
I'm very sorry not to meet friends
The Feeling 'Like
What on earth is the feeling 'like
Is it possible that a people whom I didn't care first become the people whom I like so much
There's the opposite case,of course
The feeling 'like' make me happy and cheered up
And it make me want to communicate with them more
I love Me having the loving people,but I wonder what make me feel 'like
Because they have your favorite looks
They give you a return?They are respectable
Being thinking I think I'm selfish
Especally with a feeling 'Love',I think there's a chance that turn to fall in love
I missed the bus stop that I was supposed to get off this evening
I seemed to fall asleep listning to my favorite music
I guess yes
I usually use the bus and the subway to go to the school, but today, I walked in stead of the subway
Because I went too far, I had to take the another bus that go to the opposite direction
The bus is not many, actually two buses in a hour, in the evening, so I waited for almost 40 minutes
I don't want to miss my stop any longer
Today I was spoken by a man selling nuts at a stand nearby TimesSqare
At first,I thought that he make me buy some nuts,so I was suspiciou about him
But it's not true
As he spoke,he has been to Japan for seven times,and he was soccer coach for many kids in some nationalities in Japan
He showed me a picture taken in a soccer ground
It was nice picture
At last,he said to me, 'Welcome to New York'(as I said him to be here due to my husband's business
I think in New York,there are many open-mind-people than Japan,and it's so nice to the country
I got a call from the bank I made a account today
We talked in English, and I couldn't tell him what I wanted to tell immediately
If that happeded now, I can tell him them
I went to Cuncun for 4days on ThnksGivingHoliday
It was warm and the sea and the beach were so beautiful,it was great holiday
BTW,there were so many Japanese,I was suprised  by it
When I wass in Japan,I didnt think going there because of so far
It takes about 14hours to go Cuncun from Japan
I want to go there
When I speak English, my brain seems to use almost one hundred percent on just making sentences not comprehension, back ground and something that is needed for conversation
Holiday Reception
On last Tuesday,I went a holiday reception
It was hold by the guraduated people of my husband's university
There were 30~40 people,from older to younger there
There were people who still studying
Their studying were many things,for example,structure,dance,politics,and so on
The party was so pleasant,and time flew
We had not so much time to talk with,so,we are meeting at my home  or somewhere soon
The hurricane Irene was approaching last weekend, and everybody was talking about it
Of cause, me, too
Lucky me, last Friday when we were going to see it was fine with wind
So my husband and I went to the theater wihtout any trouble
I have seen it in movie, and to tell the truth, I didn't like it that much
I espesially like one of the performaer
His face and singing was fantastic
His face brought my school days back to me, because he looked like my ex-boyfriend in high school
Anyway, every performaer was GREAT
There were some part that two or three people was singing at the same time, and I liked the harmony of their singing
We liked it so much that we tried to buy the cd at the suvenior shop in the theater, but it was too expensive; it was $40
After getting back home, my husband find and buy it for only $12 in itune
I'm so happy to listen it anytime :) 
You can find it in youtube, try it
Though I have taken many Englsih classes in the US and I meet a lot of teachers
Indeed, the good condition, my class is very small, affects the quality of class, but even if I take account of it, I think so
I met with my friend two days ago and talked about the class i've ever taken, that's why I think back on my these school days
In Japan,people put their hands on their month when they are coughing
But in US,people cover their month by their elbow inside
A few days before,I put my hand on my month when I coughed because I didn't know that
Then I was advised about cough by my friend in Ameica
He said,'the hand is used for shaking hands',and I thought it rang a bell
We talked about a lot of things; How to bring up children in my country and her country, for example, who take care of children if both father and mother work and they are out in the daytime, the difference between public and private school, and the relationship among own family
Both we can't speak English well so sometimes did not get each other's idea exactly
But the relationship between wife and her mother in low was not this case
We did not use English very well though, we were able to get our idea easily
Because we share the same idea; The relationship is sometimes difficult
We are from different countries, but have same idea from our experience
I just started 'facebook' yesterday
Though I knew the name of facebook,I already do 'mixi',kind of sns, so I haven't try that
A trigger was my friend  I want to be closer and I can't see very often
The friend do facebook, and he asked wether I did facebook
Because of  that I began it
First I was surprized by the quickness of reaction
As soon as I resistered,some of friends send me messages
I was happy to contact with them and I thought how useful facebook was
At first I was happy,but thinking about friends and friendship,I wanted to have deep friendship
No doubt it's so convenient,useful and a chance to keep contact,but I think it's alse kind of superficial friendship
I think everything have two faces,good and bad,of cource facebook has,so it's completely up to you, how to use
I don't know the reason clearly why it happened, but my hands have became terribly rough resently
Skin troubles generally don't happen that much this time of year
I tried some moisturizer, but I haven't found the best one
Everything so so
I've wore gloves during doing dishes, and it seems to work
I guess that the best way to recover is to avoid to do household chores
I called the driving school I attending for confirm my reservation in English
Before I dialed,I got pretty nervous
It's not easy to speak in Englshu,moreover it was noisy
Confirmation somehow has done,but I couldn't speak as well as I thought
But it was a good training to use English
These days, I'm wondering what dafines you as a good person or a bad person
I think I define someone as a good person, If I'm said something good with a smile, and on the other hand, I defined someone as bad person if I'm said something bad or terrible
While I talk with someone in English, I can't explain my feeling exactly as I really think because I don't have enough English skills
In other words, I sometimes speak somethig good with not good feeling
My Japanese female friend had Spanish boy friend before
They have their native language each other, so they talked in Englsh
According to what she said, she didn't love him VERY MUCH, but she couldn't express her feeling correctly because of lack of vocaburaly, so she said 'I love you!', and he seemed like the same
The question about acting is getting bigger and bigger
Some days ago,I watched a dvd 'P
It was on a roadshow about one and a half years ago in Japan,and I wanted to see it on that time,but I hadn't chance to see it
I like love comedy,and also moving one too
Though you might think I have a strange taste,I like shedding tears with moving one
About 'P
I love you',I really liked it
話がそれましたが(I don't know what should I say in English..)PS I Love youについてですがとてもよかったです！
Each musics were great,scenes were beautiful ,the actor,Gerard Butler was fantastic
Additionally,supporting actresses were cute!They made it funny
If you haven't seen it,I recomend YOU
For example,something is wrong with sound,I couldn't type '3
Because of that,the other day when I sent a e-mail to my friend,I sent a wrong zip-code>< 　(The code dropped '3
At first,I was planning to buy a pc made by Japanese maker,because my husband works at Japanese company that makes pc
But looking around in the store,my thought had changed to buying forghin makers' one,because of the inexpensivness
They were really giveaway items
It's about 5months since I came here,New Jersey
During the 5months,there were many things of cource,for example,having some partys,going to some museun,going to shopping and so on
Through those happenings,what I like about this country the US is the people living here
First,in my opinion, Americans easily open up for other people conparatively
Second,I think Americans have a strong sense of responsibility,for instance,people seem keeping their health
Of cource I like Japanese,but I like the difficulties from Japanese
I feel kind of impatience,because of my limited vocablary
I had my friend coming over tonight
 * i have a question; My friend came to my house tonight
Are those same meaning
She has been worrying seriously about her love, so I called her to come to my house
We really enjoyed talking, and ate a lot and drunk a lot
The first drink was beer that was foolowed by red wine
It's already 12:30 am, and I feel still full
What is the food that you want to eat when you are really tired
My husband will be very tired when he gets back tomorrow because of one-day business trip
What shold I make for dinner
Thai,Vietnamise,Mediterranean and India,I love all of them.(To be Exact,they might not be called \"ethnic cuisine\" 
And I like cooking too
Today I found a good source of Indian cuisine on web
All of the dished seemed d66elisious,and easy to cook
I made one of the dishes containing some kinds of spices for today's dinner immediately
It was so delisious,and I felt so hot that it seemed to make blood circulation good
I'm lucky to find the page
There are events called 'Broadway in Bryantpark' on every Thursdays in July
I especially like the main performaer, and I hoped I could see him
As the schedule the show started, and as my expectation, he show up
His performance was just ten minitues or something, but his singing voice was amazing as usual
After that he moved under the stage and seemed kind of free, so I went near him and told to him that I really liked his performance
He was so kind, and I got my picture with him
Journal Was Vanished
Just now,I was writing a journal on web
I opened some web tab,and I was using some pages
At the time,Lang-8's page was backed,and my middle of journal was vanished
There was no choice,I wrote it again
When I was about to write a email to my friend about the date we'll meet because he can't make up on the day that we are suppose to meet, I just got a email 
The email said we can meet on the day that we were suppose to meet and we didn't have to make re-schedule, so it was a very good timing
Yessterday I went to discount depertment,Century21 near World Trade Center  to get boots
There were so many boots there,and many people looked for their boots and tryed them on
When I tryed some boots,people trying boots near me spoke to someone \"do you like this one
Some people there answered her,and they began talking about boots each other
It was the first meeting for them
In Japan,there isn't such a thing often
I thought exchanging the opinion with each other,especially people meeting at the first time is great,and it's so nice in this country,US
I saw ants in the living room today and the number of the ants was about 5
I haven never seen any ants before and also any insects
I went to Target for some pesticide instantly
I hope it works
Sometimes I'm asked about something in English,but I can't answer well
I think the reasons are English skill,vocabulary and lack of knowlege
Even if I asked in Japanese,I think I can't express my thought as I'm thinking correctly
What I asked were many kinds of things,for example,about what Japanese goverment did for foreign disasters and what I think about men who have been seeing with not one woman on same time
The first question is because of lack of my knowlege
After coming the US,I feel necessary of knowing about own country more than before
look for an apartment
I carrently share an apartment with a Chainese man 
He is very kindness and tidy mam
However, I'm thinking about moving another apartment, becouse present apartment is far from my office
And also, I am thinking it's time I try to live by oneself for me
Now in Sydney, apartments almost are not available ,although, rent is terribly high
It's going to be hard job
“I'm doubt your personality”
I had a fight with my girlfriend again last night because I forgot a little promise that I had to call to her
I thought, it was small things for me but it was important things for her than I thought
She cursed out to me furiously about this matter
Of course, I apologize to her for my mistake seriously
Even thought she said to me
“ I'm doubt your personality.”
What a terrible ward
If I had been close to her, I would be settlement about this problem
But it is difficult to understand for our understanding each other because we are so far
Hard day night
So I can't write this diary these days and little bit disappinting about this
The close of the party, one of my friend got violent when he was drinking
While we waited the bus at bus stop in order to went back to home, he kicked around there such as garbages,walls and us
When he kicked a wall of buildung, a man talked him to notice about his act
But, he was just going to strike at the man suddenly
The man also was really enthusiastic about fighting with him
Around some people helped us to made to stop his fighting
I don't want to make a friend who drink heady liquor just like this
It was a hard day night
I went to Jenolan caves a day before yesterday
Jenolan caves are regarded as Australian’s most outstanding cave
I wanted to get there since I came to Sydney, however I haven’t got a chance to go there
Because there is so far from Sydney, located 175 kilometers west of Sydney
I went there with my friends and we enjoyed to drove about three hours
On the way to Jenolan caves, we were surprised that we found a dead wombat on the road
I first time to see wild wombat even as it dead
When we arrived the entrance of caves, there were many courses of cave tour
I wanted to participate a kind of adventure tour that can go inside very narrow and vertical hole
Because of I love adventures
But our friends turned down my request
They need to take part in normal course
So, I participated the two hours normal tour reluctantly
Caves were very beautiful and amazing
But I was really board around the end because of I couldn’t understand guidance by English guide
I thought I have to study English more
I’ll go to there again and try to adventure tour next time
I am writing this after a long interval because I went back to Japan as last dairy
And then I have to take exam of the IELTS next Saturday
I have not confidence to get a good score because I haven’t studied English at all while I stayed in Japan
I am writing English now for a long time in the first place
I am wondering about trying to struggle fruitlessly this week at least
Anyway, I will try to do writing practice for IELTS in this site now
So everyone, could you help me to checking my writing
He will spend several days in your hometown, and has written a letter to you asking for advice about things to see and there
Write a letter to the colleague suggesting what he should see and de while he is in your hometown
You are looking forward to visiting my country aren’t you
I was very pleased to hear you will be visiting Nagoya of my local town and hope the following information would help you significant your staying
First of all, Nagoya is really big city, the center of economic and business: hence, there is not much sightseeing places
However, I think you would like to see some places that are unique to my local town
I know you are interested in some kind of art and also miner places
Nagoya castle is visited by almost visitors in my local town
If you are interested in the Japanese historical place you should visit there but I would not suggest there because it’s really common
Nagoya city has a lot of industry so you will be able to visit some of them
Especially I recommend you to visit Toyota that is largest automobile company all over the world that as you know
If you visit there you would be able to see a process of making cars and high technology industrial machines that the newest model 
It may be that you can get a mini-car of Toyota newest model
Moreover, not far from there you can find the Toyota museum that has historical automobile collection of Toyota and some advertisement items they have used
Other interesting place are a Nagoya port aquarium, which you can see big killer whale and some mammal animals
There located 10 minutes from Nagoya station by subway so it is easy to get there
As you have not enough time in Nagoya, you probably will not be able to do much more sightseeing
I have taken about one hours
It’s too much time I spent it
It was really hot last night like a Japan summer
I’ve hard that Sydney’s summer is very dry
So I’ve thought that living Sydney in summer is comfortable compare with Japan
It is misunderstanding
Most days are very dry but sometimes it has become terribly hot and humid day that we cannot sleep well
Yesterday night was exactly just like the night
According to my Australian friend, it hadn’t been become like humid day by 5 years ago
It seems to be affected by the global warming
The Earth is definitely becoming hot
We should do something for our earth we can do it
This Year was in no time for me
I feel that it be a short time as age goes on
This year will see the beautiful fireworks
I’ m looking forward to see it
Recently, I am disappointed about me because my English skill hasn’t improved ever since I came to Sydney
But I realized that it was over-optimistic thinking
I know it about it now
I made a resolve to study English everyday any number of times but I haven’t done it because I have always felt sleepy and taking a nap when I back to my room after finished work
Although, there is putting a paper that writing “ Must study English at least 30 minutes everyday!” on the wall in front of my desk, but it has been meaningless
I have to take a lELTS test next year in order to getting my permanent resident status but I have no confidence getting good scare
And it seem to me that my English won't be progress anymore
I steeled myseif to start running 
I made a application for a Sydney Marathon today
I lose no time in getting to run about 25 kiro distance
The time was 2 hour 20 minutes
It is decent time for me at the moment
My time of target for full marathon is within 3 hour 50 minutes
I have to maintain training in this way towerd to the Sydney Marathon
My aim of training to run less than 600 kiro by the day of the Sydney Marathon
I will do the best
It is crowdy in Sydney
My feeling is not so good as the weather
Because I disputed to call with my girlfriend last night
So we are keeping love with long distance between Japan and Sydney for about eight month
However, I might be limit that continue to get on with her
It is really difficult to keep long distance love, isn't it
I hope it will be sunny tomorrow and our relation too
The cat seems to be keeping by someone but I don’t know who have it
According to my share mate, her name is Joker and she is very old
She is really cute cat
When I leave from my apartment I am sometimes interrupted with her since she sit down in front of my apartment
I always cannot help care about her when see her
To tell the truth, I didn’t like cats because I had a big dog when I lived in Japan
However she is special for me now
I am looking forward to see her every morning nowadays
My wife bocome pregnant
My wife become pregnant
The unborn baby will be our first baby
On the other hand,I am concerneed about this fact because my english skill
But my english skill is terrible as like this
Although we live in Sydney, my wife and I usually speak Japanese in most of our life when we are at my home and at office too
Because we belong Japanese company
We have not generally improved our english skill for some years to come
I worry about that I wonder whether I can bring up our baby in this country
It is my honest mind at the moment
We were enjoying have a yakiniku and drinking beer
I choose Japanese beer the name of “Megumi” because it’s my favorite
I drank first bottle of beer as soon as I got it and ordered next one soon
I asked one of the staff to bring me a new bottle of same one while point at the empty bottle
It’s a frequent mistake but I was surprised that what she said
Why I have to do it
Were you making a mistake yourself weren’t you?” I said
And she said “ I know but I would have to throw away this beer if you don’t receive it and I must pay about it instead of you.”
“ I understood you mean but I don’t need Hineken
Suddenly, her face reddened slightly and went back to the kitchen
At the moment, I realized that she attached a name card
There was writing “Megumi”
The owner wasn’t very happy about it
I was going to give in about her claim reluctantly and drank up this beer
After that we went out from the restaurant and I felt that didn’t understand about this matter
And my co-worker said to me
“ I’m sure that I had seem her when I visited there last time too
It might be she has been working there for a long time at least 3 years.”
In my birthday
Last 7th of January was my birthday
My friends took me to dinner at the Uighur restaurant after finish work
I’ve been interested in the restaurant but I have no chance to visit there I’ve ever had
Of course I’ve never been to Uighur, so I eat those food first time
Despite the first time I ate, I had a nostalgic flavor
My thought went to the country while I had a dinner
I think that most interesting things living in Sydney, we can eat some kind of food all over the world
Because it Sydney is multinational city
I might as well go to what kind of restaurant next time
A day that I had a hated for about me
I had hated for about me a day before yesterday
The day was my day off
I wanted to lot of things to do so I made a plan that I have to do last night
As my plan, I get up at 7am and go running about one hour as soon as I get up
I intended studying English remaining the morning after taking shower
And then I wanted to clean my room, go shopping, swimming at the beach and of course writing diary in lang-8
But actually I never do it
I thought to go running after I got up but I was in no mood for doing it and I started reading Japanese comic books on my bed
I realized that don’t doing it by myself in the afternoon
So I moved to in front of my desk in order to study English but I slept on my desk as soon as I was reading English
I didn’t go shopping, swimming and didn’t do writing on lang-8
I never do it that I want to do
What a being weak-welled
I got angry by myself
I will never do same failure
My nane is kojiroh
I im trying to write this diary first time
I am looking foword to reseive from your reaction
I introduce by myself
I am japanese
Actually I live in sydney now
I've been here for one and harf year
I haven't progress my english skill
I have trouble making a living, because it my skill has not made progress
So, I make a fresh resolve to write this diary everyday
Could be
Please give me advece and touch up my writing
But I don’t give up writing this diary so please don’t forget me
I decided to go back to Japan temporary next month because I get long days off
I am looking forward to seeing my girlfriend and some my friends for a long time
And I am looking forward to eat Japanese food, of course my mother’s homemade dish too
And then the most of pleasure things for me is climbing mountains
When I was live in Japan, I belonged an alpine club in my local town so I used to go mountains every weekend
However, in Australia, there aren’t high mountains
I went to top of Mount Kosciusko that it is highest mountain in Australia, as soon as I came to Australia
I have no homesick, I have no food sick, but I have a lot mountain sick
When I get my day off, I usually go to running about 6km around the beach nearby my apartment
It is my pleasurable time that running at the coastline while looking a beautiful sea
Actually I’ve had been running about 10km almost everyday when I lived in Japan
I’ve participated the full marathon a couple of times
However I can’t do it now because my job takes long time about 14 hours a day
I get up at 5am and then come back my room at 9pm whenever go working so I haven’t enough time to run
I couldn’t no longer run firstly and longer as I used to be but I wouldn’t be able to run how beautiful environment in Japan
I’m thinking about keeping running even if only days off and I wanted to try to participate the Sydney marathon someday
It's sunny day today
There is not a shared of clowd in the sky
So,　I went running to the beach this morning
Actually, there is the nice beach for ten minits running from my apartment
I could see really beautiful view espcially today
I always have been foggetten any disagreeable happen, when I see this view
I am going to go to the beach again after writing this dialy and visit a cafe where I can see the beach in order to study English
Studying should do comfortabley, shouldn't it
On the 11th of this month, that day is very important for Japanese and Australians
There is held the match of the game Japan vs Australia for the 2010 world cup final round of qualifiers
I am really looking forward to watching and interesting in this game
Australian national team is most should be caution for Japan national team in the group A
I don’t remember that one of the game of the 2006 world cup in Germany, Japan was disappointing losing to Australia 3-1 in their opening game
I think that Australian national team is still really strong now because most Australian players are playing in Europe
I expect that Australia has the edge over Japan but I don’t know what will be happened in the game
Japan can’t match for them about the rugby so I hope Japan team gets back at them into the football games at least
Our feelings had always been disappointed since 2006
I'm supprising about this site
Everyone has given me a good advice and then responses are too fast
I wish I had known this site more early
If I had found this site, I would't be worred about my writing study
I believe that my English skills are sure to progress for this site
I liked drinking wine when I was in Japan but I have became crazy about wine since I came Sydney
There is good red and white wines in Australia
The act that finding good wines which rich and taste deeply is my pleasure in my life these days
Of course, most important things for drinking wine is who drink with isn't it
I hope I drink wine with my girlfriend in here as soon as we can
The worst of  New Year's Day
I had to go for work 1st of January and also next day
The New Year’s days are very busy season for my work
When I went back to my room at about 9pm 1st of January, I was really tired
Because I usually get up at 5am when I go to work, so I had slept about only 2 hours last night
I was relaxing on the sofa as watching TV on coming my room
I didn’t want to do anything because I was terrible exhausted
At that time, I realized that I forget my mobile in my car
It would be serious, if someone called me, especially about tomorrow’s job’s conforming
I rushed outside and close the door
At the moment, I realized that I only had car’s key, I forget to bring a room key
I tried to turn a knob of the door, but it’s already too late, door was locked
Oh my god
I was panic
I had only car’s key and then I wearing pajama
Of course I couldn’t into the room without the door
However mercifully my mobile is in my car
I called my friends and got him to bring some wire
We tried to open a lock using wire about one hour but of course we couldn’t do it
If we can do it easily it wouldn’t be safety
I called locksmith, it’s no way because I wouldn’t have gone to work tomorrow if I had not entered my room
But this day was New Years day, they didn’t answer
We tried to call them again and again
One of them was on the phone and I asked him to help me but no matter how many times I asked, he didn’t receive it
When we started to call them does by about 30 minutes, one of locksmith received our offer at last
He came here 20 minutes later and he finished to open the door just 5 minutes
Even thought it costs $220.00
It was too expensive
Normally, it costs about $100.00 to 130.00 but the day was New Years Day
I won’t be able to do some interesting things that I made a plan because the money disappeared from me
How caress of me
It was the worst New Years Day I’ve ever been
It will come to Christmas day soon won’t it
I sent my girlfriend who lives in Japan some Christmas presents about a week ago
I bought a light blue scarf that is made by hemp and also bought a necklace that match with the scarf as well
And then, I made a calendar that some our pictures put them on
She told me to receive them when I called her yesterday
I am also being happy I can see her big smile
It was worthwhile to made it
I went to a christmas dinner that our company sponsered
It was a big dinner because we visited one of  very famous sushi restaurant in Sydney
I don't know why they chose a sushi in christmas but it's good for me because I love sushi
We had having a special couse menu as below
It's sounds like tasty isn't it
Of couse it was very delicious
We spent about four hours for having dinner and I had enjoying talking with my co-wokers
It was being a gorgeous night ever since I came to Sydney
I usually listen to western music as such as rock, funk and jazz and I like some kind of western cultures
But it’s just movies, I like Japanese as far as Westerns as such as Hollywood movies
I shall introduce you interesting Japanese movies that I recommend
The film is portrayed about whole tragic life of woman who filled with wacky character
It is her own fault but I don’t come to dislike her
The story is miserable but way of making composition is like a musical
It’s means a roller coaster emotion
I make a fresh resolve
I expect to enter a Sydney Marathon this year
When I was living in Japan I used to take part in a marethon race
I have wanted to run a marathon since I moved Sydney but I have not chance because of my work
And I have not to keep my motivation
However I make a fresh resolve to run a Sydney Marethon this yesr for my come to bone baby
I will be father soon
I want to have a self-confident and a pride again for the baby
My right ankle is terrible swelling
I didn’t know why it got worse
But I remember that I was bitten by some red big ants about one week ago when I was bushwalking
The moment I was bitten by them, I got pain as be stung by a bee
But the pain reduced few hours later, so I forgot about this
However, about two days ago, my right ankle was awfully itchy, so I saw the point and I realized it was be swell terribly
I went to buy an ointment yesterday and put some
An itchy is little bit disappeared but a swelling has stay unchanged
I have made a fool completely becasue it was just ants
I wonder if I should go to see a doctor
Sydney’s temperature is changeable
As I wrote my previous diary, Sydney was boiling hot and muggy it might be over 40 degrees
But next day, it was about 25 degrees so I felt cold a little bit
Yesterday was Australia day
Some interesting event was held at the city but I couldn’t go there
I stayed in my room yesterday all day long because I still hadn’t been getting better
And now, I am getting better more than yesterday
I want to go running for a long time but today has been raining
I hope it will be nice
I am bored
A little late now, Happy New Year everyone
I had a good time for New Year's Eve
As I wrote in last diary, I went to see a fireworks in Sydney Harbour
It was amazing how many times I saw
I liked to see fireworks when I live in Japan
The biggest difference between here and the fireworks and fireworks in Japan is there is not “Wabi（侘）Sabi（寂）”as Japanese Fireworks
The Japanese fireworks display usually takes about 2 hours we having enjoying
Usually a skyrocket is set off each one and we having a memory of the emotion
Only 15 minutes, the fireworks is launched in the number of amazing
I would not mind gorgeous fireworks like this
I had having a good time for New Year’s Eve like this
However, New Year’s Day was the worst
I went back to Japan last month and after come back Sydney, I’ve been really hectic
My work has been very busy and I had to take IELTS exam as you know by last diary
I have one thing that I realized when I took an airplane at this time
I am really bad at using reclining seats that is provided in an economy class seat at the airplane
I though I say it myself, I hate that I make someone trouble
And then, I’m types of person who take always someone’s feeling into consideration
To sum up; I am timed person
As I write that, my friends might say “ You are kidding.” However, it is true who even said anything
Therefore, I can’t stand being the reclining seat
I can’t believe that someone can recline the reclining seat unconcernedly without permission behind person
It is a normal manner we should ask them to be allowed it
I never do that I hate be done it
I think it is an adult behavior
So I am always thinking I ask them when I want to recline my seat in an airplane
But it has courage behavior that I have to ask a person who I never met
Actually, I’ve never use the reclining seat because I am chicken person
Accordingly, I make a proposal one thing
I hope that the reclining seat should be improved for timed person
In my opinion, the reclining seat should be reclined beforehand., in that case; if someone want to make an angle in their seat they would do it with no regard
Some days ago, in the afternoon, I was about feed to my cat
I looked over around me but couldn't find her at all
I went see her the place where she was supposed to slept
However, it was no one
Where is she
Just as I was about to give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a cat walking off on a handrail
It was must be my cat
I didn't remember
I'm living 13th -floor so I thought if she miss her pow out of the handrail, she will fall down to the graound
I ran out onto the balcony and said \"Hey, chicken is ready
here you are\" with tenderly voice
But wouldn't you know it, she ran away faster to neighbor's balcony
It was she took off like a guided missile
After an hour she got home and ate chicken and then started to clean her face calmly
Her name is Abichan by the way
Later on
Right away
After a while
Some time later
As time went on
Afterwords
He died yesterday,he had sick 2 years ago
He died yesterday, he was sick 2 years ago
He died yesterday, he had been sick for 2 years when he die
He went into a coma 3 days ago
He had been into a coma for 3 days
He had been into a coma since 3 days ago
I don't have any money
I have no money

Nowaday, it has become common sense to think that everyone should have access to the higher level of education
Most of the modern societies are defending the idea of equality of chance
Indeed, long time education has been exclusively reserved for the upper social classes but things have changed
College or university give you the opportunity to access to knowledge among highly educated professors
Studies are a difficult path but if you go all the way you will be rewarded
What is that reward you will get
Graduated persons are more likely to play a greater role among the community
It is also an intellectual and personal enrichment
University teach you how to think forward and search new information by yourself
Those qualities will be useful the rest of your life
I do believe people attend college or university in order to develop their personal skills and enjoy a life in which they will contribute to society
But I know english bad
I keep a diary from now
and I don't write diary too
so I think keeping a diary is very difficult for me
but, I challenge diary
because I want to touch the culture of the foreign country
and I want to study English because of reading English books
Let's continue to write the diary every day for the time being
My English skill
In my body, there is 9 month baby
I hope he can speak Japanese & English
Reason I started studying English
I met the childhood friends Today
My friend Yuka,she have a two children
My friend Nao,she are searching for job now
Today is very Happy & Enjoy
I am 9-month pregnant now
Everyday,I feeling to Baby's Sign
When I am listening to music in the best sign

He is English and speak very clearly so I could marginally handle the discussion about work

I'm living in the western part of Japan
Here now it is very fine and My two daughters and their cousin are playing in the garden
I'm spending a very cozy time this weekend
Osaka city has a beautiful boulevard in the center
It's width is 44 m and length is approx
Before 1995 the heights of buildings along this boulevard is regulated to 31m and there were beautiful skylines along both side of the boulevard
then after 1995 the regulation of building heights changed to 50m from 31m
It takes another several decades to form beautiful 50m skylines of this boulevard
I was starting the Lang-8 today
I wrote 3 comments to 3 people's daialy by Japanese
I am Japanese, but it was difficult to check the Japanese grammar
It became a good opportunity to know difference between my mother launguage and other launguage well
Today is my first time to use Lang-8
A little excited
I hope I can improve my English and make new friends at here

Last night,tens of cucumbers were sended to me from my home
I thought,\"What should I do such a much of cucumbers
Anyway,I just bit one
So,It's GOOD,I wonder why it is so delicious
It's \"This is the cucumber\"  rather than \" It's a cucumber \" 
Figures is bad but it's no used pesticide and above all  (I have no idea what ”身がしまってる\"　say in English
After I ate first one, next one ate with salt, and third one which is on bread with cheese and mayonnaise looks like sandwich ate it
When I notice, I ate about one-thirds cucumbers
It was fine today on the contrast yesterday
I went to job training breifing (職業訓練説明会) today
It was start at 10a
m,but the location is so far from my dorm which mean Japanese apartment,so I woke up early this morning in order to not be late, so I'm already sleepy
I'm feeling worried a lot , but also feeling interest about the class
I'm apt to shy usually, although I am going to do active and possitive this time

Always cloudy and suddenly fall into rain
I can't take a walk, can't even go to a glossery store
I hope Tsuyu is pass away rigt now or I wish it vanished
To be honest, I don't hve any interesting about soccer at all

I've had experience of farewell yesterday
We went out 12 years 
My heart is too hurt,so I can't breath out well
I had a lot of tears,but I can't cry well because my throat stuffed up soon
Before I know it, I become poor at crying
I'm disgusted with myself, I've live more than for 35 years, I don't know how to overcome such a situation
I think We have many different stuffs when we grow up
It was a fine and warm so we could stay at the second floor deck
It created beautiful contrast against blue sky
We couldn’t go up to the crown because of the limitation of the height but we were quite satisfied with the view from the base
On the way to the New Jersey, we found a long line waiting for a ship to New York at the marina
Today I received a lecture on finance
I have to learn hard
Recently, when I walked on the street by myself, I felt a little lonely
If I like to be with boys, maybe my mother need to worry
Ha~~~ I kind of hate to be oneself
t\tWhere to find a friend
t\tOne who “Always” here to help you
t\tOne who “Always” be a good listener
t\tOne who “Always” tells you a solution to a problem
t\tOne who “Always” cheers you up when you are mad
t\tOne who offers you a shelter when you are homeless
Only those can call a friend
t\tEasy to find, but hard to choose one
We are your friend
I am awaken, I am sure
When I went to the office to ask for my TOEIC score, I could not believe my ears
I didn't prepare, didn't listen very careful and I wrote too fast
I had 20 minutes left when I finished reading test
The Chinese words appeared down belong the screen were really small
There were lots of people from different country and that made me felt more difficult to hear them clearly
That's hard, but nothing is impossible to a willing heart
Tomorrow I am going to present a presentation which is about the job interview
Teacher wanted us to get familiar to the interview
I think I am ready then
I helped my classmate to translate the interview content
Her Chinese is so good, so that means I have faced some difficulties when I translated
But I am sure that I can get higher than last one
I felt some strange thing about the test
Before I did the test, I didn't feel nervous, but I felt it when taking it
Maybe it's because listening test has no time for us to rest
It just kept saying and saying and we kept feeling nervous and nervous
We finish this class and our classmates are going to gratuate soon
However, I like to go to places which I can walk to
Riding a scooter comparing with driving an automobile not only avoids traffic jams but also saves time finding a parking space
The fare is in a reasonable price, which everyone can afford
These examples show that owning an automobile is not necessary for me to whom don’t go out very often in this convenient city
I think I would choose the one who gets higher score on English
That’s why I choose English
But if I have to choose one, I’d like to work with team
I can learn something from others by joining the team
Try to think what might happen after this change
The saying goes,” Variety is the spice of life.” We add sauce when we eat, change is like the sauce that needed in our life
These days Mexico broke out an infectious disease, swine flu

Q:If the world were going to end in a week，and u were the only one who know，would u tell anyone else？
Why,or why not
A:I won't tell anyone else
If I told other people,they will feel terrified,and everyone will live in anxiety
I think if doomsday is coming,the best way to pass this days is accept the fact,and subsist as usual,don't need to change anything
My parents,my friends,the pedestrians on the road and the sweethearts in parks,they are all look as usual
I will memorize these as the symbol of this lovely world

So we shold reflect about enviroment,earthquake,energy
We have to make new systems and we have many responsibility
I used to excuse for a long time  that I don't have time
Varied generations　have tried them at solving on newspaper

Although this time we need to know what's the correct for us
Because　we did really confusion caused by rumor
Then I've seen many professional workers from on television,radio

I came to London about 10 months ago and started studying English
still a bit hard to speak fluently
when I came here I couldn't speak English
of course I knew some words and had a experience to speak someone english speaker
shy(because of japanese
haha) that's why my english hasn't improved first few months
but everyone said me \"try to speak a lot even if you made a mistake otherwise your english wouldn't improve!\" so I tried speaking a lot
made a mistake quite a lot and sometimes felt dawn
but that's the best way to improve language
you can't improve language without mistakes
these sentenses might be making a mistake but never mind
I'm going to live here another couple of years
hope I can get fluent English
hope someone correct my English
During I was a college man, I often wrote English

It is too cold to ride motorbike in this season
I have seen people who ride a motorbike in my island Okinawa in this season
But, there cold is not as cold as here cold
So, they can ride the motorbike
By the way, It is past two month that day of I don't ride a motorbike regardless of I have a driver's lisence
Can I ride the motorbike now?I don't have confidence
I know this is really silly thing
I won't ride it one year and more
Permanent
I told my aunt a few days ago
How much does it cost to have permanent although I want to have a permanent?”
She responded
You want to have a permanent
You would better ask my friend
probably she will do for you  because she really likes you
So, It is set to have a parmanent within this year
First, How much should I have a parmanent?(strong or weak
Second, I don't have confidence whether enough length of my hair
I had been having a parmanent before
It was not cool so much and weak
I have a girl friend who It got acquainted by joint party
We met to eat for dinner together last thursday
and we send e-mail to each other almost every day
I think she is prety girl but I dont know I like her or not
Are you person who laugh a lot or not?I think that you have a friend who laugh a lot
Many people have a good impression for them
You don't piss off easily at people who are laughing
they always don't laugh loudly and make voice
It looks bear to laugh
Way of laughing is important to give them a good impression
besides,I heard that not laughing properly is not good for health
that is why I want to laugh loudly when I laugh
by the way, I was wondering that what did \"Monster's Inc\" mean
I recent got it
What do you do when you want to listen any music while you are using computer
I had been using HP that you can choose category are classified by artist or title or 90's Hits or stuff like that
Of couse you can search a song by artist name or title name
Anyway, I had been using it till I find the Internet radio
The reason that I changed from that HP to Internet radio is that HP can hold about only to 10 songs at a time in the case that I searched a song by any keyword
Its bottleneck is I can't choose a music that I like at time that I like
I should be in Hokkaido Japan three month later

I suppose to  get about 300,000 japanese yen for a year If I passed the selection
I being excited before I go
The japanese is known as polite to people and can't say things clearly to other countries
So i was said that you should say clearly \"Yes\" or \"No\" when I came here by my aunt anyway
I think that the japanese should follow foreigner's attitude for people
I think that there are exception though
In some store, they always say \"Excuse me\" when they go through in front of people who look at goods
I admire that they do every time
and they always keep the door opening until people who are about to go out or into through if there are people behind them
so I think that follow their attitude to people as much as possible
it is I could hear the words of what they said but I couldn't understand quickly what they said
I take a time to understand what they say
and The conversation is gone and next words is coming during I am thinking
I need to get used to understanding quickly
What should I study particularly
I'm thinking it now
I know it's exsist
it was girl
But her looks was much older than her age
She wanted make up her face and wear fancy clothes like other teenager
She said that I was called \"Monkey\" in my school
I got sad when I heard that

I shoped at shopping mall in the morning to buy winter clothes
I left the house past 9 o'clock and I headed there by car
Although I did not decide to buy particularly clothes
But I did not like so much
There was a quite jacket looks like cool
Now I was satisfying about shopping
town
There is nothing which I can say that you should see this once in my town
Although we have an american base
But, it is not pround thing
A man came my island to visit from city to city by his bike one day for recording TV show
they broadcasted once a week
it was 30 minutes
He started from south
he stoped by each town each show and he did something like eating foods which was famous or playing games, drinking, dancing, singing
Anyway, he exchanged people almost each time
But, my town have nothing especially
so he almost through my town without doing something
he only doing was that eat a little big burger
It was not so big
We can only say that is famous a bit
I thought then that we didn't have something we are able to be proud
I often heard that the american guy like chubby woman
Is it true?Surely, I often saw couple who are skinny american guy and chubby okinawan woman getting out of club when I went back home from bowling center after midnight(its closer morning though
I admit that there are people who like chubby people in japan as well
It made me this question
Are chubby women type for american guys
If they are, Is it reason that American guys are used to seeing chubby or fat woman
I often think that american people should be healthy diet or die sonner
If you felt displeasure, I will apologize you
I almost go back to Japan
AlthoughIts about one month left
So, I am thinking that I wonder what is the best gift for my friend recently
I had them buy watches of adidas before
I wonder how much they cost me?about 120 dollars?I don't remember
I am thinking that how about buckle as gift
What do you think of what should I give them
Can you recommend me something
had you heard this sound?How did you like it
Hearing this sound first, I was shocked that such a sound is existing in the world
It has six methods of make sound
I didn't really understand difference of those
I only understood that mouth seems moving
Population of do the khoomii is keep going to decrease in Mongol

My younger brother bought a cell phone and my mother changed her cell phone to new one recently
It makes me think that whether I should change my cell phone to new one now or later
I have used the current cell phone which I have now since about two years ago
but I also think that I just waste the money by buying it
I don't have a degital camera
I use the cell phone to take a picture instead of the degital camera
The camera function of recent Japanese cell phones are so good
Those are as good as degital cameras
the shop has a diverse selection of fruit
i received e-mail that from previous girl friend
i am confused because i have not imagined it

Two of my friend are going to go to another prefecture in Japan to earn tomorrow

Their flight seems to supposed to depart at around 10 A
M
I am thinking that I want to go somewhere where are spoken English for working holiday in the world
so I have to set aside many money
I'm thinking a plan is fiding part-time job which I can live in work place and get meal from work place so that I won't spend money for rent and meal
I tried finding and found few
besides there can hire only during the summer vacation or winter vacation
It's good for me
I wonder are there any job that easy and high pay
NEET is stand for Not in Employment, Education or Training
I mean they are not working and not going to school
Most of them stay home all day and kill them spare time for using computer, reading comics, playing games or something
Can you think about that?Are they in your country as well
Nowadays people who like them are increasing and It is the problem in Japan
I heard they are more than six hundred thousand
If this problem kept going to the future, Japan would be breakdown
Probably social system could not work at all
Current social system is based on people whom working
If nobody worked, It nobody could live
They apparently think It is good that as long as they are alive
What are they thinking?Did they grow up by themself?No way
What made them become like that
This is big problem for us
There is show called american idol on TV in america
People who apply to audition are auditioned in it
it discovers people who has brilliant talent
They has truly amazing skill
To tell the japanese idol, there is big difference between america and japan
Japanese idol are focused their looks
Looks is mainly face
it is
They have surely neat face
Some of them have high level singing or dancing or something skill
I admit it
I mean, I am jealous of them
speak
some of people who use this site record thier speech and upload here
I think it's quite nice idea
I have noticed that way is good for practicing speaking
But, I thought thath its shamefull
I can't choose the way for speaking better
so I think I will do that
so I will intend to go shopping to buy a headset with microphone and upload my speech to here
chilly
Today is chilly
I was not wearing socks today 
because I was run out of socks
However I was not worrying 
because I don't have a plan to go anywhere
But My aunt asked me \"Let's go shopping\" and I decided to accompany her
She said \"Outside is very cold, Will you borrow uncle's ssocks
I responded \"I'm OK don't worry\"and left home
Outside was truly cold
I regreted about didn't wear socks
I expose myself to English everyday
But, It will end up changing that circumstance in four days
It is not good for learning English
However I can do nothing with that
I will intend to take a time for exposing myself to English as far as I can
You know, nowadays I can have a exposure to English by using the internet anytime I want
I think that I will watch American TV show from now on too
I changed some my favorite homepages' interfaces to English
Of course, I will listen to English songs or radio programs(fortunately I can hear theamerican radio in my island because of american base ) in the car when I drive
It is difficult for me to tell someone what that is
For example,What is hospital?If you were asked
How do you tell about that thing?I almost couldn't do that
I thought now, How should I tell
That is Place where to be treated
That is Place where If you get injured,You should go to there
How do you do?If you are me
There is word that we(Okinawan) think it is the standard language but Japanese(except okinawan) don't think it is not
Okinawans usage is the same as English
Okinawan can understand its meaning each other
But,I have to say by this way to Japanese
I was wondering such a thing since I started to study English
concert
I wathch the concert in the church
Concert was used with violin and piano
Two people played a violin and piano
One is man and one is woman
They are couple
I heard that They met in the music academy
They are worthy to be couple
Thier music was truly matching
By the way, I got mouse with one dollar
I may got good thing than I thought

I write words which I want to memorize so that I would never use the computer without looking the words
I will come to see those words more often
I will try anything which helps me to learn english
Fuji that is covered with snow your left side, When I was rieing in the air plane to go to Tokyo from Okinawa
Needless to say, It's nice view
I would like to try to climb the Mt

Nowadays many people seem to use the face book
I was recommended that why didn't I use the face book
I don't know what I can do on it
before I signed up it, I searched about it with wekipedia
So, Face Book is the fifth best have unique user in the world of internet
It is followed by Microsoft, Yahoo, Myspace and then Face book
I will try to use it anyways

We played the Domino after dinner
I didn't have luck so much that I lost it
I am drinking Smirnoff now
I hadn't drunk liquor for ages
script
I was using internet to look for how to study english
and then I found how to study english using movie's script
First,  you read a movie's script and kind of understand what they say
Next, You watch a movie only sound
Then, You watch a movie with subtitle
I thought I see and looked for a good movie and its script
It is easy to look for script on the internet
But I didn't find only ocean's twelve
Ocean's twelve looks like difficult
I will tell you about Japanese TV program
It's variety program
It is named \"Tamori Club\"(tamori is person's name
I like a corner of Tamori Club
Part of song is sounds like Japanese to us
First \"hey hey what's up?\" is sounds like \"sorry
I little sleptover this morning
when I woke up
It was already past twenty minutes
So, I was late for the class little bit

Swindler aim at the old who live alone
Swindler phone them and say \"オレオレ\" without saying specific name for making them assume as their son
and swindler pretend their son so that they could make them pay the money
Swindler say that I got a traffic accident so I need money soon or something like that and make them pay the money into swindler's account at bank
At first sight, It sounds like not succeed
I'm trying to study English by listening to song over and over(Is there any diffirence between \"over and over\" and\"time after time
I heard that my ears will get used to hear English sound in detail by that
The method is to listen to song more than 100 times first
Next 100 times, confirm a lyrics and pronounciation
I hope It is effective way to improve listening skills
And now, do you know the song which is fun and slow tempo
I often think that If I were comedian who appear on TV and what would I do
I watched ame talk which is Japanese TV show
Some pair of comedian appeared there
Each two people are forming combi(In Japan, we say combi means pair of comedian
Theme of that time is comedians who are forming combi with friends who know since they in school days
Each combi told us their story which they experienced in school days
They told us about their story with funny
After all, they spent a school life with funny
I though that I wondered Could I talk to them about school days with funny
I had not written journals recently
I've been busy because I came a new place
So everythings are interesting
new people, new university, new house, new environment
I've enjoied those things
I will write a journal sometimes if I have a free time
There are people who write a journal  along various topics here
People write about their life like what they do then, their philosophies, some questions that they have, introducing themselves, their love stories, their plans in the future, some topics from the news, sentment about video and etcetra
Anyway, this is so interesting for me
I can get the knowledge or their thought here by reading their journals
Somebody says that you should start to study of grammar when you meet the problem that is what you want to say but you don't know how to say in language you say
I wonder if you get what I want to tell you
I mentioned about Internet radio
than, Kidmanさん and Joshさんtaught me Pandora Radio
I accessed there after read their response right away
To chang the subject
I played the scrabble game
American is supposed to know it
The game was played by me and my brother and teacher in my ESL class
Of course, teacher won
I could not be winner
She is native american and I am japanese
Her score closed my 2 times score
I would like to win her someday
I will compare with my English skill and my brother's
It is clear that his skill is much better than mine
He has studied English longer than me
Although It is properly that his English is better than mine
I have only to study harder
Just do it
However regardless of his skill he doesn't speak to people so much
I often think it
He should be able to speak more
Although I don't know what he is thinking about
My aim of while I'm in the US is getting used to hearing english pronounce and becoming to make english pronounce
Left time is only about one month
I mean one part of the Japanese song is sounds like English to people in English
I got up early in the morning to go there
I had not gotten early in the morning recently because I don't have nothing plan in the morning
Of course, I enjoyed it
To begin with we wrote information about ourselves on some piece of paper
Then we introduced each other because there were new students
Although everone said \"What is my name?\",\"Where I am from?\",\" How long have I been here for?\" and anythings else what you want to say
One thing happend that I was surprized
There is person who might relative to me
I am not sure yet
we Taking a break, I read a reference book
Person who student from Poland asked me that May she asked me something
and she continued that What was my last name
and I answered my last name
she started to explain why she asked me about it
Simply speaking there was person who married with man has the same last name as me in her family
So, I and she might be family
At any rate I asked her that was he from Okinawa Japan
She doesn't know
but, she said that she will ask him about that
By the way, the reason that why she noticed about it is that Every students write name on piece of paper to confirm for present or absent
She looked at that paper
It is interesting If it is true
Bully
I often use a internet on computer
So, It is reasonable to see opinions of people who have various ideas
I often find people who are annoying and bullying someone on internet
It can create nothing
Althoug we need argument that have meaning
I want to say loudly  \"Don't spend your precious time for dull thing
when I wacth the same TV show as before
When I also listen to music
I think this is big step for me
Come to think of it, my aunt had us made cheese cake
it included Cranberry source
Its taste was not bad
She said to me \"I put into it too much Cranberry souce
more than half of can
She made also normal cheese cake
but, I couldn't have it
I heard She is going to take somewhere
I heard a woman who live in South Korea passed the exam for getting driver's license by newspaper
Moreover at the 950th
Long time ago, I had watched that woman on some TV show
She passed the exam minimum score
The next exam seems to be waiting for her
The next exam is driving a car on the road
Can she do that?She was said that she might pass the exam at the first time by chance
I heard she costed it 4200 dollars
Although I may must not mention the religion
There is will being not to say the complaint of the religion
People here is want to learn second or third language
So, I believe you can think about another religion from you
I think Most people have some religion
But, Not all
As far as I know there is one person who have sturdy religion around my space
I think having some religion a few in Japan
Meaning of Christmas is not known to almost people
I was looked strangely by people who have some religion when I say that I didn't have any religion
I think I live in various idea from various people

I heard that she will intend to quit her current job and go to my aunt's house in the US for few months in this summer
There are not many people at her work place because many people quited recently
My family recommended her to quit her job because they make her over work
besides, they pay her very low salary
Her work seems to deserve more salary though
I have to find an apartment in Hokkaido, Japan because It set to go to a university in Hokkaido from April this year for one year
I had not found properly apartment
Althought I have already gotten material of apartment from their support group

Sometimes you lose motivation with studying
I wonder what is this term
I think everyone has had this experience
I am in this term now a bit
How do you overcome it?I think It will leave someday if you would nothing
The problem is that How you overcome it as soon as possible
Nobody help you
You have only to do by yourself

Translate
I have translated what they are saying in some american TV show to japanese recently
It is for children
So many times there are phrases I don't know
I'm sure that It helps me very well to study English
I watched musical today
Although I couldn't understand what did they say,but I enjoyed visualy
They did such as mic perfomance,tap-dance,sing a song and play instruments
It took a time for about two hours include break time
I went to there with my aunt's friends who are elder ladies
I did a good experience at there
Poteto chips
it is difficult to use mouse or keyboard while you are using your computer and eating poteto chips
because you mind sticiking chips' salt with it
but, it can be hassale to wipe it every time
A toy's factory picked on it
and invented thing to solve it
it sounds like stupid
but, its true
Can it come to be used
Do you want to try to use it
I recognized that speaking in English is difficult
I had invited to the party that my aunt's friend had
There was child who was my aunt's friend's nephew
I played him all the time at that party
He was talktive and he talked to me
I could understand half of he was saying
Although, He seems not care that I couldn't understanding
I may be able to ask some question
But, I am poor at remarking and expressing my feelings
My uncle bought the Apple cider a few days ago
I had him theach about it because I had not seen it
First, I was thinking Apple cider is Apple soda
But was not
Cider means pop soda in Japan
I found it that cider is not soda pop that time
It's japanese english
We have many japanese english
American have too
I try to american english called american from now on
Tell the truth, I have not drunk it yet
TV Playing the \"umbrella\" sung by Rihanna and Jay-z, I was studying

I went to my aunt's friend's house and ate sukiyaki today for dinner because today is chiristmas eve

I heard that yesterday's dinner is turkey
I guess I will be satisfied for dinner tomorrow too
I am sure(I bet?)I am lucky man
Yesterday, I thought that my pierces was getting dirt and I washed them
They are circle and part of it is ball
It is getting pain When I try to take to cartilage
I am wondering what do I do them
I wrote last entry that I would buy a headset which was with microphone to record my voice for getting better my speaking skill
I bought it day before yesterday and I tried using it
its mic recorded only loud sounds
so I returned it today
It seems that the usb type of headset is better for sake of like that
I wonder I'm gonna go to BEST BUY tomorrow
I don't have a class on fridays
So, I spent using my laptop in this morning
I ate a chicken noodle soup and a tacorice for lunch
I almost use the same material as taco
Anyway, on eating these food, I went to a shop to volunteer
Especially nothing happened at there
Driving my car, I noticed feeling odd vibration in my car
I thought that came to thing of it, my brother had mentioned about this vibration
I came my home and then I told my uncle it
I said to my uncle \"My car may be strange
I feel odd vibration when I ride
My uncle answered \"Okay, I'll check it
Frankly speaking It seemed to has some problem
we left our car to repairing shop
I don't know when it finish to fix by
Thre were UFOs in my house
UFO is Japanese Yakisoba and is instant noodle
Why there were Japanese instant noodle
My aunt bought them to send her second son who belongs to Air force and he is in Afghanistan now
It is pasted seal that is printed 3.65 us dollars
In japan, about 2.00 dollars
As It is including a tax, buying in america is more expensive than buying in japan
By the way, speaking of instant Yakisoba in japan,we divide two party
they are UFO party or Ippeicyan party that is instant Yakisoba too and its feature is eating with source mixed Blighting and mayonnaise
I would rather Ippeicyan than UFO
Got a cold or something
I hope she is gonna be next class
I sometime listen to japanese hiphop
It may be made fools of that the japanese say such as \"hiphop\" by people who are from the home of hiphop culture
At any rate, there is japanese hiphop in japan
Surely, it pretended american hiphop first
but now, it is established as new genre
I think that method of rhyming is very special in japanese hiphop
I don't know about hiphop very well though
you know there are big difference between the way of speaking in japanese and in american
I heard our prime minister told us that it was the kindest that human would be disappearance from the earth
But, I thought that If you say such a thing, Nothing start
you should say more positive opinion to future
The number of people who are Japanese don't trust politician recently
because the problem happened so many
Somebody is liar
they who happened some problem quited easily
American politicians seem to have responsibility to final more than Japanese
Moreover, there are many people who enter the polite party by popularity in Japan
I want to be adult who have responsibility
Although I am already adult on the law
FInally,I got a perm
I had said it couple weeks ago
At any rate, I took a picture of my hair from each angle with the camera which with lap-top
I laugh at it only by seeing
To tell the truth, I didn't think get so strong perm such as this
I dreamed more weak perm
but, I don't regret
It's interesting hair
So, that's okay
I wonder I try to take hairband to this hair
Japanese have a blue tongue
It's joke
I make it a rule to avoid eating snacks between meals to not gain more weight than now
I gained weight no less than 5 kg while I was in the US
After all, american foods make people to be fat
They don't care amount of oil to make some food
I think that not all people do that though
As for my mother, she makes it a rule to avoid using oil or something that makes your health bad effect if you use that too much
But if my mother were not person who care about that, my health would to be very worse and fatter
Please give me a advice for this
they people write about their life, what they like to do, and their philosophies, share their love stories, their plans for the future, news topics, sentiment about videos, etcetera
anyway, this is so interesting to me
i am able to gain insight of people's thoughts here by reading their journals
it has been said that you should start to study grammar when encounter problems communicating your ideas in another language
Goal
What do you study a second language or third language for?do you study for traveling?for business?for making a friend all over the country?I think everyone has a goal vaguely
We learn English for at least three years in junior high school
People who go to generally high school do that for six years
Most of students are not interested in English and don't think that want to master English
I think
I was one of them
I would score good at the English test
But, I studied for only passing the exam
So I don't remember almost what I studied
Now I have studied English
I started to study English by chance
I still don't know why I started to do this
But now, I am thinking that I want to communicate more with English
I intend to do this by taking a long time like 10 years
I am thinking that it is good that speak to English speaker with no problems when I will be 30 years old
That is why I have studied English slowly
I wanna tell you about strict rules of hair style in Japan
I had been wondering and having this opinion for long and long time ago
Why do they have so strict rules of hair style
You are in society, you are required clean and fresh hair style in japan
but, I understand that bacause you have to give people who first contact or your boss your good image
part-time job place too
So, what do you think in this case
We were baned tricky hair, perm hair, shave one's hair and men's extremely long hair  till graduate high school and we have to wear uniform
Your country probably doesn't require you such a thing
I have asked my teather this question
he said that to practice group act
I think is only wearing a uniform not enough
They must wear uniform, So It is reasonably to show personality on their hair
I think this is one of strange thing in japanese
I don't think such a thing now because I already graduated
I called support group which help me to find an apartment in Hokkaido at about this time yesterday
After all the gap of time between here and there on the phone
I greeted to Mrs Nagata who is taking charge of exchange students
and then we did small talking
For example \"What time is it there?\",\"It is very cold now
Isn't it?\" something like that
it's done
I told her the apartment I kind of decided
Wsn't it
I had though that not care width of room
So, I responded to what she said \"I don't care width
I will be stisfied with it has space for sleeping 
Regardless of I refused, She recommended me wider room
It she recomended is managed by her office
So, she recommended me
I asked her that how much did it cost me a month
I heard It cost me 40000 a month Japanese yen
It was too expensive for me
I told her what I wanted again and She told me she will confirm if that room is available
She told me please gave me call again the next day
You know the next day is today
I have to call her again soon
I hope it is available
loss of hair
What do you think of loss of hair for man?Maybe you can't think about it
But, There are people who do it in japan
How about another country?Does your country do it too?I may be said something if I said \" I decide to do loss of hair.\"But please think hard
It makes easy to shave your face or you don't have to shave
If you did facial loss of hair
It's over to go to ESL class this year
So, We had party
We brought food each other
Everyone brought own country food
Of course, I brought Sushi Roll
We didn't finish foods and A lot of foods were left over
So, We made lunch box that like a sampler and took home each other
I was put into my sampler  a lot of Gyoza( is chinese food's name
too much
Cake that made in america is so sweet after all
I have a japanese tongue
body
I studyed a part of body in the ESL class
How should I say
name of body\" or \"part of body's name\" or other way
That was my first time to go to the wedding party
I was not concentrate for the wedding party because I often wached a photographer
She was so pretty
I want confidence of talking to somebody who I meet first time
I tried saying her that would you take a picture with me because you are doing nothing without taking pictures, you should be taken the picture sometimes
Isn't it?Recently, I often think about how to ask girls out
Do I want girls
If you were be able to use telepathy, do you think you can contact people who speak the difficent language as you
or you would use images
I thought suddenly such a thing
There are various people in the world
So, I guess there are people who can use telepathy as well
I want them experiment it
I thought that it might need high level skills to understand and laugh at Japanese comedy
Because of it, they say a lot and fast
sometime they say difficult thing to grasp what it means even for us
They basically make us laugh by saying not action specially Manzai
Some of them make us laugh by their reaction though
They host many Japanese show
You never see on TV without seeing them
Recently, they appear in drama, movie and radio
Some of them released songs
I don't think they have talented singing skills
some adults say that comedy is not good for children's education
However, It will seem not to reduce comedy on TV shows
You say OG which mean Olive Garden
I ate stuffed chicken sarsale(?) sounds like that
I was starved
So, I had been working hard to eat until I would be full
I resulted in eathing too much
I will say closer
I ate a lot food like salty breads and salad before main dish
I had a stomach ache when I just finished to eat
Perhaps the reason was the belt which I was binding to blue jeans
It is best in my ranking of the food service industry in US
I am often said that I seem not to have worries and I am an optimistic
maybe I am an optimistic and I have worries but it's less than others' If I say about this
So, it is not so uncorrect
Actually, I think that I will want to live marrily in my life and I will want to die before it will come to be in boring life
I don't want to be in boring life
I don't want to last with tube that make me live and artificial respriration machine in the hospital
I live now strongely so that I may not be so
I hanged out with three of my friends who I met in university
I joined for them late a bit after they eat something for dinner
It was because that I already had had something for dinner then
they were sitting in front of restaurant and talking when I went there
And then we headed a place where we played a pool
We divided us for two team and played
I had not played it for a long time
but I played it better than I had thought
One of us was called by his girlfriend and he went her place
He was what was called a moody person
So we vaguely talked about why he get angly easily and how should we cope with it
We couldn't find a solution of it
So I want to ask you how I shold do with it

I thought that it might take high level skills to understand and laugh at japanese comedy
This is because they say a lot and they speak very fast
Sometimes what they say is difficult to grasp, even for japanese people
especially manzai
Some of them make us laugh by their reactions though
Comedians host many japanese shows, even at prime time
You can never watch TV without seeing them
Recentlly, they have appeared in dramas, movies and on the radio
Some of them have released songs
I don't think they have good singing skills
On TV, they say funny things and speak a lot as if they were born to make us laugh
Some adults say that comedy is not god for children's education
However, It does not seem to reduce comedy on TV shows
I used to be a good bowling player
But now I am not good at the bowling any more because I don't bowling a lot now like before
so we often used to go to the bowling center and played it
I was good at the bowling then as if I had been professional bowling player
I used to score the high point like over two hundred
that was crazy score
This is just my proud story in past time
Then I recently went to the bowling
It was not different so much from girls' score
that place is stored weapon
i think big accident will happen  if that fire touch that place 
please teach me my fault 
I am confued
I have not understood different between \"have been\" and \"have been -ing
What is different between \"I have stayed in Japan for about one month\" and \"I have been staying in Japan for about one month
These mean same way in japanese
It is difficult for me to make sense

Affective of the Earth Quake
In 2011.3.11
We got the Japanese Northeastern Pacific Ocean earthquake
This earth quake is one of the biggest earth quake ever,then that damages are so serious too
I guess everyone know this big news, but almost all people can't imagine what is going on at Japan
So I want to explain about these from now
First, It is a food problem
Some of the victim can't get enough food because rodes were broken by earth quake and tunami and absolute amount of food is too low for all of victims
Of cause Japanese government and other organization are tring to food supply, but it is difficult because of for these reasons
This story will tell you how Misery are victims.\"One day a man could get these food for a day, half of bread and half of rice ball
Second problem is a radioactive
This problem's news is bigger than earth quake's dameges for people
Nuclear power plant were given damage by earth quake and tunami
So radioactive are comming everywhere
Japanese government and Japan Self-Defense Forces are tring to reduce damage of radioactive
Specifically, they were watering to cooling pool of the nuclear power plant to cooling down
Now,Nuclear power plant's crisis is almost over,but at that time people thought this crisis is return of the chernobyl
It is an electrical problems
Remember,Nuclear power plant is a power plant for Fukushima that is the place there were given the biggest damage by earth quake and tunami
So around that place are black outing
However they need electrical right now
But of cause it is impossible
So Japanese government uses \"plan blackouts
It means Tokyo has some blakouts few times in some days
It is so inconvenience
But they are patiencing for earthquakes victims
These are what's going on in Japan right now
Please fix these sentence for me
In a few corrections are welcome
His works have had a huge effect on old Japanese society
His works and thoughts are effecting today's Japanese society also
If he didn't wrote these works, Japanese society is different from now
So we should know about him
He was born as a lower class samurai's son around Osaka on January, 10, 1835
When he was three years old, he was adopted by his uncle because his father was died
He started to learn Chinese classical literature When he was fourteen years old because it was an accomplishment for a samurai
It is said that he was very good at that
At that time, the Japanese Government practiced national isolation, it means no import and no export with other countries
But the Netherlands and China are only countries that were excepted from the rule
So, Japanese scholars studied Dutch at that time
Then he became the chairman in that school
In 1858, he built the school that is now \"Keio University\" to teach Dutch studies, 
but he noticed that Dutch studies couldn't help to learn about Western culture and style
So he started to study English by himself to learn and teach about Western culture and style
By 1867, he sold his Japanese sword to go to America again
Later in life, he wrote many books for society and people, Then he died on February, 3, 1901
Among them, these three books,\"Things western\", \"Encouragement of  learning\" and \"An Outline of a Theory of Civilization\" given greatly affected society
The first book is \"Things western
This book is made up of 10 books
At that time, very few Japanese people knew about the western culture, style, and things
The people of that time read these books, and they could learn about western style and different the Japanese style was
These books were  200,000 copies
This amount is very large number for Japan at that time
The second book is \"Encouragement of  learning
This book is made up of 17 books
These books outline the meaning of study and how it should be done
In those days, Japanese study is too confusing and too complex for normal people
So, he share his ideas about how to study on these books
His idea is \"Study should be more simple and more efficient.\" 
So these books were very good to tell anything for normal people
Then some part of these books are used in Japanese textbooks
All Japanese people know this phrase,\"天は人の上に人を造らず人の下に人を造らず。
Its meaning is this,\"Heaven doesn't make a man better than others, nor does it make a man worse than others.\" 
Almost all American heard this phrase, Because this phrase came from The Declaration of Independence of the United States of America
These books were 3,000,000 copies
This number is amazing, because in those days the Japanese population was only 30,000,000
It mean 1\/10 of Japanese people read these books
The last book is \"An Outline of a theory of Civilization
This book made up of 10 books
These books were written on 1875
These books outline is about civilization
In these books, he said that civilization's true nature is human companionship and Coexistence with any kind of elements
These ideas were the basis of those days idea of civilization
These books were not the best sellers, but they are evaluated by today's scholar
So we can say his works and thinking greatly affected Japanese society
If you want to increase your knowledge, you should read his works once
I wanna know which sentences are curious or which part of my sentences configuration is strange
Today I had a test, but I can't understood these question's meaning
So I couldn't solve today's test・・・

However I need to leave America by June 25

I don't care how many number is it
Fukuzawa Yukichi, He is one of the most famous author in Japan and one of the most respected person too
His works given huge affect at old Japanese society
His works and thought are giving affect to today's Japanese society also
His words are often quoted by speech
So I want to introduce him from now
He was born as a lower class samurai's son in around Osaka at January, 10, 1835
When he was three years old, he was adopted by his uncle because of his father was dead
He started to learn Chinese classical literature When he was fourteen years old because it is an accomplishment for samurai
When he was twenty first years old, he started to go to the most famous Dutch studies school in Japan at that time
At that time, Japanese Government did national isolation, but Dutch and China are only country of out of example
So Japanese scholar studied Dutch at that time
Then he was be the chairman in that school
At 1858, He build school it is an origin \"Keio University\" to teach Dutch studies
But he noticed Dutch studies can't help to study about Western culture and style
On the 1860, he was chosen to American envoy's member
Next year ,he was chosen to Europe envoy's member
Besides on 1867, he solve his Japanese sword to go to America again
After these, he otherwise scout from Japanese new government, he focused on his school management it was changed to learn English studies
After his life, he wrote many books for society and people, Then he dead at February, 3, 1901
His literary works are often knows, and his books and thought given very big affect to Japanese society
Among them, these three books,\"Things western\", \"Encouragement of  learning\" and \"An Outline of a Theory of civilization given\" given huge affect to society
So I would explain about these three books
First one is \"Things western
This book made up of 10 books
These books were written on 1866-1870 when he came back to Japan each times
These books outline are the culture, style, and things in western countries
At that time, almost all Japanese people doesn't know about the western culture, style, and things
So he wrote these books to explain western style's Politics, tax system, bonds, companies, diplomatic, military, science, technology, school, newspaper, library, hospital, museum, steam engine, telegraph, and gas lamps
The people of that time read these books, and they could know western style and how late Japanese are
These books were  200'000 sold
This number is so big number for old Japan
Second one is \"Encouragement of  learning
This book made up of 17 books
These books were written on 1872-1876
These books outline are what is study's meaning and how should be study
At those days, Japanese study is too confusing and too complexity for normal people
So he shows his idea about how should be study on these books
His idea is like this, \"Study should be more simply and more efficient.\" So he used plain writing on these books, but his idea on these books were great, then some part of these books are used to Japanese textbook
All of Japanese people know this phrase,\"天は人の上に人を造らず人の下に人を造らず。
 It meaning is this,\"Heaven dosen't make a man better than others, nor does it make a man worse than others.\" Probably you know this phrase
This phrase came from The Unanimous Declaration of the United States of America
This phrase was used on the first sentences of the Encouragement of learning
These books were 3'000'000 sold
Because at those day's Japanese population is only 30'000'000
Last one is \"An Outline of a theory of Civilization
This book made up of 10 books
These books was written on 1875
These books outline are what is civilization
In these books, he said civilization's true nature are Human companionship and Coexistence with any kind of elements
These idea was be basis of those days idea of civilization
These books were not the best seller, but these books are being evaluated by today's scholar
As mentioned earlier, his works gave huge affects to Japanese people, scholar, thinker, and Government
A lot of thinker were from his school, a lot of great government officer are his friends or his students
So I can say his works and thinking gave huge affects for Japanese society
He has great talents
Then he could gave huge affects to Japanese society
So still he was prised by us
We can see his picture on  ￥10'000 bill
And ￥10'000 bill is the most expensive bill in Japan
It means he is one of the respectful person in Japan
That will be good experience
Thank you for read

I could say I may be addicted to chocolate
Milk chocolate tastes good, but I like bitter chocolate
Bitter chocolate is not too much sweet and not too much bitter
I used to see that 99% cacao chocolates are sold at convenience stores, but these days they are not seen
Every time I saw them sold, I thought no one wouldn't eat them because they are too bitter
As I thought, they disappeared
I think the balance is important
I upgraded from Vista, but I haven't realized yet that 7 is much better than Vista
Indeed, the time of startup and shutdown becomes shorter
But I think there is no big difference between the two in user-friendliness
But then, I don't hate Windows because I don't feel inconvenience
I haven't used Mac
If I bought Mac and there was also no big difference between Mac and Windows, it would mean I wasted money
So I don't feel like buying Mac though I want to buy Mac
What is Mac like
Is this conversation right
Some weeks ago, I was asked by a foreigner at night
The foreigner pointed at the entrance of a station and said to me \"Metro?\" I answered, \"Uh
This conversation seems to be strange now
But when I was asked by the man, I thought of many things in my mind
Although the station is under the ground, not all the stations of the route are under the ground and most of the stations are on the ground
But now that seems to be not proper
Do you think this conversation is right

ところが皆ことわりました。
面白くないと見えて見ました。
やむなく一人でも見ようと心だって上映のせんーしゅうらく映画館に行きました。
コカコーラを買って映画観に入場したからわたし一人だけでした。
そのりょうりょう
最初は私の映画観をもていたのそうにおもしろいかたです。
それでも時間が経てば経つほど気味があやしかたです。
突然鬼神でも出現すれそうに。
結局映画が終わるまで怖い心で見ました
今考えて見ればとても面白いけいけんでした。
わたしがいつまたこの大きい映画館で一人映画を見られますか？

We have decided to change our business-model to the new one without a selling function
to consumers
In this case, we are afraid that any writer will not feel it attractive because we
hold no data of the consumers
So, we will have to add anew a strong-point to it
Plan1
To produce well the person who has a lot of valuable information but is not good at spreading
his to the society
The problem of the plan1
The plan1 will earn a little money, though it has a lot of social meanings

Have you guys ever seen \"Coraline\"?If don't,you must go and enjoy now!Because you just can't miss that great movie
If someone ask me what is my favorite movie now,I definitely will say Coraline
Since I saw the trailar on HBO ONE ON ONE I can't wait it release
Now I can see it on HBO,I've already watched it about 7 times
I love its sound track and the way they used in shooting
Coraline is an interesting little girl,and her \"other mother\" is really wiered and scary
Maybe I will like my \"other mother\" if she doesn't have button eyes or transform into a huge spider when she's get angry
I really really enjoyed the time that Coraline gave me

It's a kind of luxury that you can enjoy only in the holiday season to go to bed and wake up at anytime you want to
But since the holiday season is ending, I have to go back to regular hours
I have some essays to write, but before doing that, I'll go for a walk before the sun goes down
Although I want to write about night visit which is held on the Eikando-temple, it too sleepy to write it
I will write it next time
In this season, autumn, it is being cold, and leaves of Japanese maple are turning yellow
The Higashiyama area turns to be more humble than the other seasons, so you will find beautiful sights in the area
Tonight I took photographs of this temple, but it was too dark to do
So, these photographs are not beautiful very much
I will take some photos which uploads in this site before it gets dark
This is first entry that I write a diary in english
I am abashed that, because of poorly-written dairy
If you find my correction in my dairy, will you please correct it
I first went to the Heian-jingu shine at Night
There are many sightseer from several country including Japan in this area
The Heian-jingu shine was built in the 19th century to prise the virtue of two emperor
The year when the buildings of this shine were completed had been just 1100th since the old capital of Kyoto was founded
One is the first emperor, Kanmu, who first opened Kyoto city, and the other is the last emperor, Komei, who based in Kyoto
The building in the Heian-jingu shine is replica of the imperial palece in Kyoto city in the 8th century
In this conference, I got knowledge to improve of my study
The Eikando-temple is holding the special night visits in this season
The Eikando-temple is one of the most famouse temple and garden
I like moving around Kyoto city at night, because there are not many people in the city
At night, you can see different sight from the daytime
If you come to Kyoto, I want you to walk around the city at night
There are not any problem on the security in Japan, but you can not ask anyone where you are if you are strange
I don't have the event to write in this site every day
Kyoto is an old capital in Japan and has many traditional buildings,such as temple and shrine, including seventeen sites of the Unesco world heritage
I will write about Higashiyama area in Kyoto next time
Japanese political situation has been confused recently
Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has not leadership and very decisive
The most important political problem Hatoyama Cabinet holds is \"Futenma base problem\" which means that  to which place American forces stationed in Futenma street in okinawa in Japan should be relocated
Cabinet has not found the ideal solution to this problem yet
But the deadline is by end of the month in May according to the agreement Japanese and U
S government settled last year
If Prime miniser Hatoyama dosen't propose a good solution to U
S government, He will resign his position,because It will mean he breaks his election promise
Japan need a good prime minister who has charismatic like Jyunichiro Koizumi having worked as prime minister from 2001 to 2006
I will take pre-1st grade level English proficiency（英語検定準１級）early next month ,the test is approved by the Ministry of Education
So if you pass the exam,you can certify your English reading and listening skill
Therefore it is said that you will get the  advantage over people who doesn't pass one when you enter a company in the future
I'm especially poor at listening to English
I can't depend on friends of Lang8 as for listening skill, so I have to study by myself
It think it is difficult,but I found that there are many people who study for the test of Japanese such as ”日本語検定”in the world through Lang8
It encouraged me,and I decided I would try my best to pass the exam
I watched the movie\"Catch me if you can\" which was fillmed in USA and in which main actor is Leonald Dicaplio, Tom Hanks
This movie is very srilling and so interesting
Karl Abagnail who was acted by Leo is swindler and he passes a forged check and gets a amout of money
After all he is arrested by investigater Tom acted, but after that surprisingly his ability to make a forged check was appraise and then he was employed by the competent authorities of finance
This end of the story is especially interesting
The movie in this time gave me an aspact of  seeing the new Dicaplio
After now I will look forward to seeing the his movie
By the way I did not watch the movie without Japanese subtitles
I have studied English for about 6 years in junior high and high school, but to listen to native English is still difficult for me
driver's license
These days I go to driving school

I hope that there will be no accidents and I can get a driver's license
This is the first time to write a diary in these two years

I'm happy for that and proud of Japanese culture

At first, for those who don't know well about me, I tell you that I am kind of addicted to Magic
It has been my hobby since I entered my university, and I even set up the magic club in it, because there was no magic club in the university
Anyway, yesterday I watched the practice of my junior, who is going to participate in the coming contest next month
Because it was at night, every class room in the university being closed, we decided to practice in a family restaurant in Shibuya
It must have been an unusual sight for those nearby that two men were fiddling with playing cards
Fortunately, my junior's magic went well, and could get a good reaction and big applause
To our joy, they have us remain in their table, and treated us to dinner
At that time, we are a little bit drunk and got carried way, we answered to this question in an arrogant way, saying
Now that I think about it, what a shame I said
Anyway, it becoming late at night, they stood up from chairs and said they had to leave
and Ms
I wonder how foreign people see Japan's peaceful constitution
Our constitution was actually imposed by the country which occupied our country from 1945 to 1952, the United States of America, on us, and suprisingly It has never been revised since then
Because Article 9th in our constitution prohibits our troops, Self-Defence Forces, from being dispatched to battle fields, the troops had never taken part in the wars till the end of the Gulf war
Well, in a strict sense, the existence of SDF in itself is actually the violation of Article 9th, but for the sake of simplicity let's put it aside for now
During the Gulf war, because we were not able to dispatch the SDF to Kwait, we assisted Kwait and the international force with a plenty of money, more than 13 billion dollars
However, this was regarded as the arrogant attitude, trying to solve every problem with money, and Japan was criticized from all over the world
After the end of the Gulf war, the news paper in Kwait listed the countries which assisted them on its paper, but there was no name of Japan.) 
From then, Japan became to think seriously about how they should contribute to the world
Nowadays, many politicians are moving on to revise the Constitution, especially Article 9th, so that the SDF will be able to be sent to battle fields
Actually, the number of citizens who demand the revision is also increasing too
The other is to remain as it is now, and be an exemplary country which pursues the world of non-violation
So I refrain from expressing my own opinion against this problem
I hope this essay helps you know the problem of the constitution in Japan
Do you know that windows in the buildings built long time ago, let's say 500 years ago, are thin at upside and thick at downside
However, these things are only the part of glass
In actuallity, the word \"glass\" is used in a more broad sense in a scientific world
The glass used in daily lives consists mainly of silica dioxide
By heating and melting a mixture of silica dioxide and accessory components, powder of metal components, you gain the liquid of it, and then by quenching it we obtain what we call \"glass
However, you should not recognize glass as a substance made up of silica dioxide
Actually, every kind of substance can be glass; even water can be glass too
The defenition of glass is \"the state of frozen-like liquid, which has randomly-disposed molecules.\" Be careful not confuse it with solid, which has regular molecular location
Anyway, as I mentioned above, glass is a state of frozen-like liquid, so it possesses the character of liquid
This film hit the screen quite recently, and I am not sure whether it is screened in Japan, because I got the DVD from my friend, who download it on the Internet
The story is that a Palestinian refugee boy was shot by the Israeli military forces, which took the 10-year-old boy, playing with a toy gun, for a member of the extremist
Finally, the doctor told his father that the only way to make the most of his death is to transplant his organs to other kids, the Israeli children
Well, this is the main story of this documentary
The father suffers from whether he should give his son's organs to the Israeli children, whose country's military killed his son
I-Phone
Yesterday, I bought an I-Phone, which I had wanted for so long
By actually using it, I am quite satisfied and surprised with its functionality
A brand new I-Phone doesn't contain a lot of functions, which is still far superior to other cell phones, but you can add as many applications as you want by downloading them from the Internet
The application which surprised me the most was Google searching system
With it, you can search any information on the internet without typing any word
The only thing you have to do is to say what you want to search into the mobile
This voice recognition system is so great that it can also recognize very complicated words
It even can recognize the words \"Maxwell Boltzman distribution\", which is a jargon in the field of chemistry
If you still don't have it, I strongly recommend you buy it
Of course, its monthly cost is a little bit higher than others, but it really deserves it
Now I am in the job hunt
From this August, I just started my job search
I don't know what the job hunting is like in other countries, but in Japan you have to confront the great inconvenience concerning the hotness of the summer in Japan
No matter how hot it is outside, you have to get into your suit to take part in briefing sessions of companies
I really hate that I have to wear a tie in such a drastic heat
Well, it's no good grumbling about this, so I will talk about what kind of job I want to get
Although I am studying chemistry in my university, I have a strong interest in consulting companies
The content of their job is a mixture of logical thinking, in other words creativity, and the communication with clients
I am very satisfied with what I am doing right now, science, but it lacks the communication with people
Because in my job I want to have a communication with people at the same time as thinking, I have come to think that a consulting company is the best choice for me
but I do my best
Nowadays everyone has a microwave oven in their home, and gains benefit from it
At first, do you know that microwave ovens can neither heat nor melt an ice
Microwave ovens are home electronics that can be utilized to heat food by exposing it to the microwaves which generate from the attached parts called \"Magnetron
this is because a water molecule is polarized, but I don't go further into it for the sake of simplicity.) This vibration causes frictions between the water molecules and the inside of foods, which results in the generation of heat, and of course this heat increases the temperature of food
I hope you could instinctively understand the system of microwave with this explanation
Actually the way I explained is not scientifically rigorous, but it doesn't make a big difference in the result
So now let's go back to the question written above, why ice cannot be heated by micro wave oven
High-class restaurant in Japan, which is often called \"Ryotei\", has experienced several hardships in this 20 years
The first hardship was the bursting of the bubble economy, which took place around 1990, and the second was the Lehman collapse
These incidents caused the decrease of their customers, but still they could continue to operate business due to politicians
Since the post-war economic growth period, Ryotei had been used by many politicians for faction meetings during an election and Cabinet formation
The change in administrations will be a big blow for them
Because the new administration, the Democratic Party, is very eager to reduce waste, the members of it are not likely to use expensive restaurants
Well, this would be really a tough time for Ryotei
Actually many of them has closed recently
In my opinion, it is the time for them to diversify their business
Maybe they should expand their customers to the average people, who couldn't visit Ryotei due to lack of money
Recently I started to play a video game of Nintendo DS
Nintendo DS has a plenty of study softwares in which you can study what you are interested in such as English, history, economics, and so on
Right now I am playing the game which you can learn the world map
I am ashamed to say that I was so idle a student during high school that I hadn't known the places of many countries till fairly recently
However, this game really helped me improving my knowledge of geography
If you have a Nintendo DS, I strongly recommend you utilize these games to learn the field at which you want to be good at
Unfortunately, Tokyo dropped out at the second vote
When I saw that Chicago dropped out at the first vote, I strongly believed that Tokyo would win this vote, but it was wrong
It's a really monumental thing to have the Olympics in South America
Takeshima Territory problem
In 1952, the Korea president at the time, Rhee Syngman, declared that the ocean area including Takeshima belonged to Korea, and this was actually the start of this festering dispute between Japan and Korea
When the Japanese Education Ministry guidelines were announced in 2008, Korea responded strongly against this guidelines, because the guidelines said that there is a discrepancy between Japan and Korea regarding Takeshima
This story tells us the difficulty to solve this problem
This entry's aim is to let you know about Takeshima Territory problem and not to blame Korea
Today I spent whole my day setting up the apparatus which measures the heat capacity of substances
I am researching about water, and by using this apparatus I am searching for the existence of the 4th phrase of water
Wow, how long I have not written a diary
Well, nice to meet you again, do you still remember me??(laugh
I always wanted to keep a parrot as pets for my magic show, and now I have one
I bought a chick, which is tough to raise, because it is more easy to make it friendly with human beings
I will be able to know it in one year, such a long time
I hope she or he is male, because it is said that a male parrot is more talkative than female - it is because a male parrot has to mesmerize a female by singing during the time of estrus
Today was the start of the later process in my university
When I was looking for classes which pique my interest, I found a very intriguing class
It was \"Esperanto-language course
Its grammatical system and vocabulary are mainly based on European languages, but many complicated things, such as the gender of noun, the indefinite article and so on, are eliminated from it
I especially found it helpful that there is no indefinite article in this language, because the concept of it is difficult for Japanese to grasp
Unfortunately, this language has not spread among people, so only few people can speak it
However, I, who is a little bit perverse, like studying something which is not popular and seems to be unuseful
I am planning to take a level four of the Esperanto Language Proficiency Test(ELPT) at the end of the year
I prepared for an examination
I am very tired, and have been sleeping during time long though it is necessary to study

It's 5 days
Sinece I've worked hard for few month and got up early everyday to learn English, I'm very tired
I'm going to sleep, reflesh, exercise, and so on
I've read newspaper and book for three hours
I've been seriously learning English since this January

I got to know with people leaning English like me
To communicate them is exciting too
In this morning, I twisted my ankle when I got halfway to the office
I looked the other way when I was walking
I fell in ditch
As the development of the Internet technology, more and and more digital productions are widely used in people’s life
Such as mp3,  psp,  digital cameras
Those of things have improved our life’s quality
In my opinion, there are at least two effects that these productions give us
First and foremost, it is no doubt that the productions make our life more convenient
For example, we can listen to music everywhere by mp3
However, there are also some defections
For example, now many mobile phones have the e-book function, which we can read some books through the mobile phones
While the word size in it is very small
What’s more, fewer and fewer people use computers , instead of handwriting
I don’t think it is a good for our Chinese to promote our Chinese culture
So I wrote this comprehension topractice
I wish someone can help me to check in it
SHOULD ONE EXPECT A REWARD WHEN DOING A GOOD DEED
Different people have different views about wether or not one should expect a reward after doing a good deed
There are two kinds of opinions about this
Some people consider that we ought to expect some rewards from others
After all, you help them from troubles
While the rest part of people think that we shouldn't get anything from others after doing someone's favour
Lei Feng was respected by them very much
If you do a few good things to others, you'd better not to expect to take some rewards from this
In my opinion, after doing a good deed,you'll feel very happy
Compared with rewarding, the feeling of happiness is more important 
If all of us can help each other, our society will be more civilization and harmonious
This morning, I got a phone from a management who want to hire an English teacher in primary school
Besides , this school’s hardware is not completely
If I accept the invitation, I will work in Fengtai Beijing in the future
But in the fact, the work place ,whichI want to go to most is Chaoyang Beijing
I believe it can take me a lot of lucky things there
Although I will work in the next several months, it’s very important for me to learn more knowledge, such as the second language
Sleeping to late
Recently, I always sleep in the midnight
I don’t like my biological clock that is not properly
Though I know staying up late has bad effect on my health
But I can’t help doing that
When I turn on the computer, I always do a lot of things , which are just for fun
Such as viewing the web pages,  watching videos, and so on
What depressed me that I would get up late in the next morning
So many plans couldn’t finish because of sleeping
Delaying is my biggest disadvantage
I wish I can correct it in the future
Thus, I will be able to succeed

I have been studing English hard these days
I found out the statement as follows in my textbook for studing English
In that sentence, can I use \"didn't work\" instead of \"wouldn't work
Could someone talk to me about that diffenence
A computer game \"Three Kingdoms 11
These days I am into \"Three Kingdoms 11\" that is a computer game made by Koei
Koei is the Japanese game company
It has many masterpieces of computer game such as \"Three Kingdoms\",\"New Horizons
When I was back in middle school, I was hooked on \"Three Kingdoms 2
I deeply realized the fear of a computer game addiction at that time
But I have endured the attraction from \"Three Kingdoms\" since I was afraid of being \"Pye-In\" in Korean
Pye-In\" literally means \"ruined person
This means an addicted person in negative meanings
Finally I started to play \"Three Kingdoms 11\" that is the latest edition of three kingdoms series
I enjoyed that game for around 5 days whenever I have free time
She prohibited me from playing that game as I was getting too addicted
That made her stop me
I am having a hard time to follow her words

what do you think is the good point of Japan?   ｢(´へ｀
Reacently, I became not to able to appreciate this country.(I have so many reasons for this
And my fixed idea that is bad points of Japan  obscured my view like smog
So I want to know the good point of Japan from another angle
Please write your thought & feeling without reserve
The ploblem is What it is for.In any case
I'd like to apologize for that I haven't check this site for 2weeks,and so being so late to comment
And Thank you
Two weeks ago,I've been felt heavy in the head
These days,I struggle to execute my art work,and I ponder what does it bring to people
From the beginning,DO PEPOLE DEMAND ART IN JAPAN
ANIME,GAME,MOVIE,MANGA,you know almost of them(exept movie) are industry we Japanese proud of
Ofcourse I love them,but
Japanese arts are for example,Nihonga,(Japanese-style painting),Ukiyoe(wood endraving),Chaki(teathings), Jiin(the architecture of temple and shrine),traditional architecture and citylandscape
These are all of crafts not Arts
These looks art,and why these was born and succed results from old Japanese general's favorite of beauty craft
And on the threshold of an age of peace -Edo period these luxury item transformed and popularized into math's life
Only Ukiyoe(Japanese printings) was born at Edo period
It is like Managa and poster,supposed by math
All of them are craft in life
And craft is in utilitarian objects made by the common people
Nowtoday,say to sad traditonal crafts are not in our life
People seek more convinient and comfortable products.(ummm
This subject is like textbook
On the other hand,modern art is not supposed by math in Japan
I'v worried about  majour worthiness of things in Japan
In this nation,people don't give weight to traditional culture,don't think to save heritage in our life
Companies want to multiply wearth,so produce too many wasted and  products
There is flooded with goods which is row quality,cheap,and not necessary to buy
I think to use one good product for long time,is very fine way in life
Where do we-Japanese will go
I lost what I should make
And there is many people who don't have phirosophy
They don't say 'no' by onself
They can say 'no' when the group's opinion is 'no
What is right,what is wrong, these thinking is not important for them
Only important thing is safety-first
Many Japanese are unwilling to make waves in community
However they are under a stress
So they like to complain in more small group or web
But don't move and raise their voice to change
I said myfriends my thinking and Japanese people's infantilism,they became sulkily and said 'That's the way it goes,I don't think it is much of a problem
What is community for?And why do they have franchise
I was tired of these things,and heaviness in my head grew more and more
I didn't want to see people,and I withdrawed into myself
In deeply mediation, I want to break this depressed state
And I thought do some relaxation exercise
At that time,my friend ask me to her friend has mauntain hut to skiing,so why don't you skiing for a bit of relaxation
The mountain is in Nagano,where was hold winter Olimpic cause the snow's good　condition and nearness to Tokyo
Under  clear blue sky,in pure atmosphere,I enjoyed skiing
I used full of my body and a part of blain  which were'nt used usually
And in the end of the day,my mind was washed somewhat
I love skii
Skii is the sports of dialogue with mountain,I think
Myself with ground
Listening in silence,talk to slope and snow
Harmonizing body with inclination,enjoy skiing full at fresh snow,have a good soak in beauty in wood
When you meet some wrong conditiion, bump of root,fields bare of snow,dip,you can change them into fun course where you can play tricks only in these situation
Get on,bound,and jump higher
Grasp condition of snow surface and inclination of slope,concentrate your attentiopn on the point between board and ground,and imagine the best balance of your weight and the world under your feet
To do like these is very impossible to skii
Get and imagine yourself as weight,pure and simple form of weight,objectively,and the consciousness in body-which changed mere object-will begin to slide on air
Feel so good,and the beautiful scenery came into your view like flash
When layer of Scenery beauty and comfortable lesponce from ground overlaped,you'd surely feel pleasant
Days went on so
Beautiful scenery and pleasant tiredness let me rest in peace
I went back to Tokyo
And now,I hope that I'll be able to see this town at new angle
And I decide to trip to Kyoto in this month to see how the society consits
Doing nothing but complaining brings me deep dipression,and nothing become change
I should take advantage of this ploblem to change and make it my work,and then draw people into my vision
As if I run on root of wood,avail it to try to turn and enjoy spin
I decide to execute my work more sharp and more strong to strike a cord in the heart of people

When we arrived to our station,we asked to lady of the station attendant to our hotel  
But we couldn't completely understand the Czech 
駅に着き窓口の女性にきくが、すべてチェコ語で全く意味がわからなかった。
We strolled around the station about one hour

I read another book about the measures to use English correctly
It says to memorize a dozen of useful expressions must be helpful to use English correctly
I found I have not used several expressions which were introduced on the book
To memorize 50 or 100 expressions might be helpful for the beginning of the study to use English correctly
I got up 4:30am today for the lessons at the English school
I must be sleepy around noon
I usually go surfing on every Saturday with my friends, but I am going to go tomorrow instead of today because one of my friends had a commitment today
I have checked the web site for surfing in order to find out which place might be good for surfing tomorrow
The web site says \"You should go to the place which the wave is the best.\"  What a unbelievably useful advice 
Tomorrow, I will try to choose the surf board which is best, leave my house when is best, go the the place which is the best, wear the surf suit which is the best and ride the wave which is best
No wonder
it seems the best time to sleep

i am not sure what can i do in the nearest future
i have working in fitting shop for one year
i can't sure i can go to upstair and design die 
in the one year , i  comprehend the structure of the die
i konw where is reasonable from structure side of a die
so i believe myself having the ability to design a good die
Today is busy
Today is full day ,we have class all day
Morning is painting class,how bad picture I paint,so i erase it and paint a new one,which cost lot of time
the old picture were looks biger than real thing
how troublesome,i must have paint careful next time
At lunch,I eat a bad taste food-a kind of noodle which taste sweet
you konw,I am a Chinese lived in south,so i like spicy food and don't like sweet food when having lunch
however i like eat candy when i have nothing to do and feel boring
Afternoon class is Computer,how fast the teacher speak,i can't catch what she said,like many students arroud me
there are two vitnan girl in our class,and they just have studied Chinese about a year,so i think they may don't understand what the teacher said either
i want to revise this class in weekends
Most touching thing is a article which i read in magazine
it's a story about a couple from China and US
the man is a soldier who undertake task in Iraq
As is konwn to all,if you were assigned a task and stayed in a country which surrounded in confused war,didn't you feel miserable?i think everyone will be understand their mood
But at the same time ,when the US soldier across the street,he find a slim asian girl with beautiful hair and fall in love with suddenly
that's like thirsty person find fresh water,but more romatic than this
He go straight and say \"hello\"to this girl,but the girl just in silence and smell to him,which he think it's the most beautiful smell in the world,like angel
They meet each other in the street on time every day,just like if they had appointment
Times go by ,and they live happily
But thing not always that fortunate,the Chinese girl must go to Dubai for work,and the soldier find nothing in the street then
they are not lover before it ,just normal friends
Even worse,the soldier have a crash few days later
Some of his colleagues are dead and he survive with wound,after he recover in bed of hospital,a familiar face come in sight.\"that's the girl i dream,oh,thanks for god to sent she for me again\",smell reveal in his face
the doctor told to him that the girl is invited by his army because he always say her name and Dubai loudily,and the girl take care of him about 3 days which amaze many people because everyone don't understand why a asian girl take a US sodier so carefully and don't leave
The sodier fell so happy and thankful about it and told to the girl if she can be his girfriend
the girl smell and agree
After that,because of the wound,the sodier lleave Iraq and marry the girl in Chongqing provence,China
they live normal life but very happy
Normal is just fine,i think,if whole world have no war and hatred,everyone love each other no matter where they from,sharing the culture and language of each other,that's would be a good social and everyone may live happier than ever
Todays English
Today i learn some English words,and i put it in sentence to memorize it
The old Aswan dam was a barrage
Today ChangChun are snowing
Today,to my surprised,our university were filled with white snow
although days become warmer and warmer,but in northeast of China,it's still cold
Morning,i study English ,it's not easy,the most hard thing for me is memorize the world
when i try my best to memorize some new worlds,i will forget it in half hours
the second difficult thing for me is the spoken English,when it comes to speaking English with other , i allways speak Chinese English,that's sounds not native
i think i must improved my English by reading much too English novels and conversation
Afternoon,i study my major class \"Advertisement\"-class of design and interested Finance
At night,I wll study Japanese
I am still new for this language,so i must try my best to learn this
Last but not least,I must insist in writing English diary to improve my English
This is my first English diary,it may looks like writen by primary student,but i think if i insisted ,i will improved a lot
PS:Best wish to Japanese people in the terrible earthquake,hope them fine
I got dizzy in my head today,which feels not good
Since yesterday night,i feel dizzy for no reason till now
It's may last about 1 complete 1 days,which properly caused by using my mind to offen those days for learning Japanese and French
This is so confused,adding English,and i am learning 3 languge at the same time
I admit i like to learn new language and try to devoted myself in other different culture
I like Japanese as it sounds nice and i like the Japanese movie and cartoon,and when you can speak a long Japanese sentence in rapid speed,it's so funny,isn't it?but Japanese are so fast to listen,but fortunatly,the pronounciation is not so tough
My main point are put in Japanese this 3 month to make it come to some level that can understand most of content in the Japanese movie and songs,and then i can be relaxed to learn this kind of language
To French,it's really a useful language
It can help your English and be the leader to learn other Latin languge like Spanish Portugal Italy which i want to learn a little in the future
Frech words are more scitific and pure,so it's may a little easy for you you momerize in the later period
i find learn French is funnier than English,the pronouciation is more easier than English,so we can read most of French easilt without looking up the dictionary
I want to try my best to familier this cultural languge,which my let me get more close to Eroupean culture
To be honest,my English is still poor right now,so English studying is still te main point in my languge studying life
But it seens i have some problem in English now,the most important is the words
English words is so scarry and i don't konw how to handle it
When i look the English article or news,when come across the new words,i feel so worried and look up the dictionary,but foget that after few days
From the all language i like to learn
i love Russia best,the words is so beautiful and the pronunciation is so sweet
so i choose this language behind English Japanese and French
Because the dizzy,i have time to write English diary
I think i should write more diaries in the future to improved my English
and try Japanese too
hope i can write Japanese even my Japanese is bad
hope someone can revise my diary,i may make many mistakes in it
thanks a lot
God bless me with my FINAL EXAM
It's been long time before i write diry there again
thank god, i finally pass the college basic of computer
oh,i really hate this coures
it's may be the most sukest coures i have ever met,may useless and complex theories
So,i have to go over it day by day,which you can image how terrible this feeling can be,uhm?when you try to study something that you compelely have no interest in it and it's worth nothing,ok,just try to pass the exam and not to be inforced to study this coure the next term agin!but thank god,i pass it,and may of our classmates have pass it,what a nice news,isn't it?but there a little something unluky that one of my roomates has not pass it,and the only the for i can do now is hoping he may be fine in the next term and pass it
oh,when this horrible exam went,here comes another difficulties
i will have almost 5 exam to take,including history, philosophy, the theory of spreading ,modern chinese literture and ancient Chinese literture
oh,Satan goes to kill me,the only way to help me is just go over it and be confident that you can achive this and do a good job
Hoping every thing about final exam will be fine ,and every students get good marks in the last period of this term
After two and half years living in France, it's very difficult for me to speak English
Before my speaking out, I have to thinking about the word I'm going to say is English or French, and the pronunciation I'm going to made is English or French
And when I'm writting English, I'm always confused whether the last letter \"e\" is necessary or not in the word
Although I'm working at a French company, but our official language is English, I'm writting English email everyday, we take meeting in English between Chinese and French colleagues
But I find I'm speaking untypical English, and there isn't good example surround me XD
So, I decide to restart learning English, learn to speak English in the authentic way

I hiked the mountain today, ' Kuramayama' is not high so it took only 3 hours to walk the hiking cores
There is a shrine at the top of the mountain where we Japanese call one of the power spot in Japan
Power spot , where we feel more energy of god and that will give us energy, More women go to such spot to wish their pray
They rowed in a line in front of the place where people stand and bow then pray a wish one by one
I am not religious person
I think I can wish but god do not make our wish come true but I myself  have wish come true
However I saw my friend wish strongly, I prayed my wish
Every one around me are always happy
I say it only today
Now I am in Southampton, which is a southern city of United Kingdom, and going to take a presessional  English course for 10 weeks

Living in another country makes the ordinal daily life difficult
Today I had lunch party having hand made breads
I baked two kind of bread--- one is with curry and another is with ham,corn, mayonaise, and cheese
We talked a lot and eat a lot
I have made breads for two years at my house, and it's so fun and refleshing time for me
My children often disturb me when I make shapes, but I ignore or ask them to help me and enjoy it
The smell that breads are baked  is really fantastic

my new semester
My new semester is coming
In this semester, I'll have a lot of plans, so it's time to get busy
I think when your life get busy in order to do what you want to do, you are on your way to your dreams
I will have lessons in the Neworiental school this semester
I never been there, but I've heard them before
I like the teachers there because my sister told me that they are funny and owning some kinds of charming personality
In my opinion, the most important thing of teachers is not about how much knowledge they have, is about how much knowledge they can bring to their students
So a teacher who can be paid attentions to is also necessary
And the first book I read this year called Outlier
The way that auther analyzed the success of people was very very special

As a result, the people show more emotional, impulsive and irrationally action and they are easy to influence other people’s behavior and social phenomenon such as genocide, stereotyping, and disinhibitation
The many American military also protect by government and hide in the crowd
In conclusion, Zimbard and Milgram’s experiment certify human just act one’s own role faithfully, and depend authority and group
These problems often happened like school, daycare, and company
Human always can be turning evil
Since childhood, we must learn that do not punish weak and poor people, and should not kill someone though parents, teacher, and religion
However, our societystill have bullying, power harrasment and war
Why does it happen insistently
There have some cause of human characteristic
Milligram and Zimbard’s experiments, especially, is important because they make clear why people happened cruel matter like Auschwitz, and Abu Ghrab torture and prisoner abuse
First of all, the Milgram and Zimbardo’s experience prove people are effect easily by outside influence
Miligram and Adolf Eichnmann, who conduct massacre by Hitler, have same situation
For example, they work distance from the subject and are tasked particular role
As a result, they assume the action as one of tasks, and completely absorbed in the world
According to milligram, S
Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.\"  
The point of view is no one doubt or feel wired about the situation
An Eichmann once insisted to just follow higher officer and escape from the crime
In conclusion, the hero’s behavior and the idea are mirror person’s live
He meet with blind man for the first time; thus, he acts like does not care or hate Robert
There have discrimination and preoccupations to handicapped people; nevertheless, they work together, and then the hero realizes the blindman’s ability
Even though he could not experience, the fact give element of surprise and makes close to them
We tend to like everything same and similarity; yet, when you encounter the something different, it would bring new view and world
I feel living foreign country means to confront discrimination
For example, my acquaintance who understand English was talked behind her back at subway
Also, aother person was threw stones from native children when he ride a bike, and my friends had experienced unwanted sexual conduct from home-stay familly and proffeser
In addition, it is not only Japanese but also other foreigner
Before, I took ESL (English second language);then, some Maxican insisted \"the native don't beliave us because the policeman often called to us to stop
In my case, it's no big deal than my friend, but I was not a little dissapointed because the country received many foreigner; therfore, I had though they are liberal
Of course, To go abroad is exciting and valuable things, but it sometimes makes me notice human dark side
I LOVE Manga, Anime, and shopping
but, there is nothing in the place where I live
I know I'm in here for studing, but they give me frastrating
What is “our” means
It is the reader, young teen ager, or America
We often use “our”; yet, there have different target
“Cathedral”, there draw “our” life as person who is non- handicapped and “our” as disabled person
In the story, the hero meet with blind man for first time, and it especially show how behave to the blind man, Robert
This situation is to be possible to occur, and  mirrors our lives
The protagonist’s attitude is awkwardly first and makes friend gradually with him over wall the prejudice
The hero’s attitude show how person have reationship with handicapped person in real world
 friend, friend, friend
I went to a concert which my friends play opera in the school
The show was fun although I don't understand because they sang in Germany
After that I met another friends ,and they brought me to internet company
In the shop, I asked the adviser about changing plan, but he didn't get it
Then, I was really confused, but my friends understood what I want to say, and they translated instead of me
Recentry I can talk with them smoothly more than before so, I had though My speaking is growing
But in fact, thier listening skill is growing up:D
At least, I never learned people are valued looks
My parents did not say that, and teachers also
Instead of the ward, they tell “It is more what is inside than out” However, how many people realized and experienced it
It is almost never
We learn looks is important through our experienced
At the same time we notice the particular people attract many people, and the appearance are changed their attitude, then why we is it so
There have two of causes and they tell how attractiveness is important
First of all, attractiveness key of character building
His study examined shows the subject pictures which are some variety of attractive children’s: bad, good, and neutral; then he ask them about the children’s character
As a result, the judgment become good as the looking is attractive, and become worse as children is non attractive
Also, Landy and Signal (1974) make students essay, and the subject evaluate essay which is attached their photo each of them
Although some essays are good and the others have error, the subjects tend to make good grade to attractive students
We judge whether person is good looking or not, and change aptitude without intention
These are one of the reason why attractive people are smart and intelligent, and a cause which they are often praised
These bring easy to get confidence, and become leader and popular in school and society
It is one part of my essay

One day he goes to a baser instead of a friend’s sister who he likes, and tries to present for her; however, he faces obstacles in there
The author tell some theme and teaching though the character, and to enter the unknown world
First of all, to enter and expect unknown world lead too much confidence on oneself

There has fact that he has liking for her, and she look enviously at him
These bring him a big responsibility and, have a chance to close her
Also, it lead image what baser wonderfully event
Moreover, the image becomes larger and larger automatically through her attitude and wards
The small hero is deeply in dream, and cannot find out the truth
In consequence, his disappointed is big when he arrived narby, and feel miserable darling go back home
These are happen many people too
In my case, many my friends are interested in America, and they make me to draw great world; thus, I expect everything different, and I can change completely by going to other country
However, it was just image because I hit the wall such as language and difference of culture as same as other international students
Also, many of them go back country due to mental illness
They think America is “cool”; yet, do not notice there are necessary a lot of effort
The author send message that looking forward something bring happy and feel more exciting, however too much expectation bring cause of estimation
Everyone goes into an unknown world although they have experience that differ either greatly or not so much
“Araby” is story about gaining experience
The protagonist is a teen ager, and the story is written from his point of view
One day, he goes to a bazaar in the place of a friend’s sister who he likes, and tries to buy a present for her; however, he faces obstacles in there
This brings him a great responsibility and, gives have a chance to get closer to her

First example of the problem is his relatives
When he tells his aunt he is going to the baser, she looks at him suspiciously that he is be up to something, and the people around him, like teachers, also treat him strictly
Also, the protagonist keeps doing boring and simple work for Araby
However, there have things that cannot get over or nothing to do by one’s self
For instance, his uncle did not get go back home on time, and forgot that he was going to the bazaar.(page432
After that, he takes the train and gets started for the bazaar at last
He realized the journey has finished badly
People cannot control their own life and some time, hard working does not connect succeed
Finally, there are likely things that will not be understood if people do not experience it
Even though he made the tripe alone and he has a particular mission, he is just a child to outside world
It is emphasized she treated him coldly
The journey changes nothing and he goes back home being angry and sad
However, the facts, the merchants are Western people, the unknown world is nothing, and he did not know how small he was, did not know until he explored Araby
For better or worse, these experiences give a big impact to his own mind than the ones he hears from the other people and leave something as value
and I'm not sure about the imformation even I have a test tomorrow
There did not have hierarchy, and did not people who were aggressive and wanting to fight
In Pueblo Bonito, the largest town at Chaco Canyon, the people lived in brick building which have 800 rooms and use 30000sandstone to build
There already existed religious and worship ceremonies place, KIVAS
The government control the society thought religious power
Their previous foods were from crop like bean, maize squash and the society was matriarchal
In contrast of Southwest, there has hierarchy, and the worship based on the system
The people were divided nobility, “great sun” and “nobleman”, and commoners, “stinkers”
Also, the tribes were aggressive and more war-like, and they lived in mound building with density populated

The man who is from America say \"where is Canada
 and \"that is a littele America\" as a joke
In the comment, there was written \" each neighber countries don't have good relationship.\" 
The comment assume me because when I drived with my friends who are Taiwanese and Chinese, they discussed about thier identity and recognized of country
Also, my classmate asked me \" Don't Japanese and Chinese get a long each other?\"  
I know it is complex question,and it is sometimes taboo, but the topic is very interesting
To Live Other Country : Part 2
Things that living foreign country means to spread my view and idea
My mother is nurse whose job is to care hadicap people, and her hospital have school,car, and bus for them
There are made society for handicap- people, so I had thought their and our world are separated in Japan
But, in my living country, many handicap people use pablic bus, which have lift for wheel chair ( it's cool!!!) and some blind people go to college 
Also,gay people work in the cloths shops like For ever 21, and in my shool, lesbian couples kiss in the hall(\/\/o
They can work whthout hiding thier identity, and the class-mates talk them as a one of the friend
They seem more free and comfortable than Japan, because a my friends was quite his part time job due to gay, and he secret his sexuality in his university
The country take care not only majority but also minor people
I think that is one of the reasons that many people move to there
I want to go Canada
I am especially interested in halifax because there has a famou university, good foods like sea food and old history

Unknown world and journey give us hope; however, traversing often accompanies danger
this is a assignment for German class
could you check grammer
and please tell me if the imformation is wrong or the sentenses are something wired
In 1920’s, German economy was struggle because of defeated WWI
At the time, Adolf Hitler became president and started to control German organization
Then her family move to Amsterdam, Netherland for escaping from persecution
She was celebrated 13th birthday on that day and received a diary as a present
After that, Hitler and Nazis invaded and took over the Netherland
The Jaw was dominated new rules
Her family went into hiding in his father’s office, and their friends’ help to keep hide them
Anne spent most of time writing diary
She leaves to write dairy life, and his family
On August 4th German police found their hiding place and they were taken to concentration camp
First of all, the protagonist has a prejudice about disabled person which is the same that person do not connect handicap person
First time, he does not want Robert to comes his home, and tell his wife to do not have any blind friends
He implies to do not want to relate except non- handicap person because he feels something different about blind and handicap and has negative impression
Also, when he and his wife go to meet the blind man, and saw Robert, “he was wearing a full beard
Too much (P.126) he said
In this period, people would have bear; however, he irritates everything about the blind man and gives a reason why I do not like him
Moreover, the hero do not he turned to TV after talked the blind man although he think the blind man does not make sense the TV show
The attitude show the protagonist wants to stop the conversation
In addition, he thinks creepy about Robert’s eyes and the moving, and wished the blind man wear dark grasses
He considers as different kind of people and is repulsed why not the blind man wear glasses same as other blind man
These action is used when people do not want the particular person to close and do not care whether the person hate us or not
People tend to make judged based of their selves and if someone have lack of ability than them it become cause of discrimination
For instance, in Robert case, the protagonist knows he is blind for first sight; thus, the hero assumes he cannot see or does not understand everything about around him
He said to make Robert embarrassed
He did not expect that Robert answer the question
Also, When Robert ask something to him, his answer is simple and he sais to the blind man flat down because he consider if he have a conversation to the blind man, Robert would not make sense what I talking about
In addition, the hero gaze the blind man’s faced many times and observe the blind man’s actions even though usually, the behavior is rude
The biggest reason of the act is that he has no idea the blind man notice it
Furthermore, he has an image handicap person nothing to do without support
Therefore, he thinks need help or something to do when Robert feels struggle
Thus, He buttered him up two slice of bread (P.127
And stare how to eat the dinar
In this way, he looks down the blind man and image nothing have ability with a few of pity
There represent our unconsciously behavior and thinking

some of my friends, especially Japanease, tend to become the holic
I worry about them, but they say \" I can't alive without ★bucks
To me, the coffee shop is one of the favorite place, but not so crazy of it
First example of problem is his relatives

The protagonist keeps dining boring and simple work for araby
In this way, the hero encounter some troubles and he have got to patient to achieve purpose
Moreover, he meet with happening that good for nothing shiftiness
His uncle does not go back home on time, and forgot that he go to the baser
page432) He should to go more early time; nevertheless, he has no way without waiting for his uncle to get money
After that, he takes train and get started for the baser at least
He successes get over obstacle, and seemed his trip is successful; therefore, his heart is filled with happy expectation unknown world
However, there wait for just real world
He arrived the place on late time; then, there was no-lively and almost darkness
There is no fantastic place what he think and he disappoint to do not present her something nice
He realized the journey is finished badly
People cannot control their own life and some time, hard working does not connect successful
Finally, there is likely not understood if person do not experience
In the baser, young lady and gentleman speak English accent (page433) although the baser are named araby
He must shock the fact because he is no idea that western people sell Arabian products
Further more, he noticed unwelcome the accent due to period of donate and oppress
He listened to fall of coin (page433) the hero has his eyes opened there are realistic and commercialistic place
Also, in the shop, a lady came to him and asked compulsory
It means he do not appropriate the shop, and judge he do intend to buy the product
Even though his tripe alone and have a particular mission, he is just child to outside
It is emphasized she treat coldly

It increase LDL; thus, saturated fat is known as unhealthy fat
The fat is made combination of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen that is fully saturated with carbonhydrate, and saturated compound are all single bond
In contrast, unsaturated fat, which are found in plant, and vegetable oil, are liquid at room temperature
The carbon- bond is double bond
It carries cholesterol from the liver to the body cell’s in the blood, however; LDL stick and do not move smoothly like HD

One other study looked at stockbrokers considered to have a lot of stress
But I continued to be interested in languages and when I entered high school, I dreamed becoming a translator
I wanted to work as a translator at home and bring up my child
I don't know for what people learn languages on Lang-8, but I hope they've already realized or they will realize their dreams
A few days ago on the way to Europe I got stuck in South Korea because of the volcano eructation in Iceland
After looking for an other way to get to the destination, we got tired and decided to go back home
The problem has happened by the natural desaster, so we had nobody on whom we can take out our frustration
But problems always teach me a lot
After getting back home, I read the book of Chuck Spezzano
Three months ago this book has taught me almost nothing, but this time I have found a very important answer to one of my question about the life
This is really huge, I feel so happy now
But I use just a small square space 50 cm on a side
The rest space is took up by 50 books, 2 big dictionaries, the mess of papers and the things which I don't even know what they are
I made this plan 1 week ago, but after then the mess is just growing
The second reason is that in such standard boxes we usually keep the things with unfixed forms, like groceries and etc., therefore, standard boxes are more heavy-duty than other boxes
I've been dreamed to have a very big comfortable bed for a long time
This dream has come true yesterday 
Today I could get up early and feel myself very fine 
I took a work in morning fresh air 
I really wonder why this dream remained as a dream for a long time
I should have gotten it a few years ago, if it can dramatically change my life
I should make a list of the other unfinished plans and unrealized dreams 
20 years in bed room
If I'm going to live till 60 years old, I will spend 20 years in my bed room, so I should spend more attention and money to make my bed room comfortable
This is my translation of the production by Kobo Abe ''The box man
He was one of the japanese avant-garde writers
Paking tape (waterproof) - about 2 m
I like the japanese common saying 雨垂石を穿つ that means constant dropping wears away the stone
I also like the sound of this saying 桃栗三年柿八年（ももくりさんねんかきはちねん）
It means that it takes three years to get peaches and eight years to get mons
But, as the japanese proverb says, time flies like an arrow （光陰矢のごとし）
I think if I make a constant effort, I can see a very good results soon
I feared taking mistakes in my wrinting, so did‘t write new diary these days
It‘s grammatically not correct to use a same word repeatedly in a text
So, for example, \"Japan\" has another name \"county of the rising sun\", or \"USA\" is sometimes called \"county of freedom
On the other hand, in English a word has lot of means
I feel English is very friendly language compared to Russian
Russian always frighten off foregin people with it‘s intricate grammer rules, heaviness of sounds and  many decorative expressions
It took almost ten years for me to like this language, although I like it very much now because it opened me the whole new world
The air is fresh and water is so clean
People live here looks so casual and relax
