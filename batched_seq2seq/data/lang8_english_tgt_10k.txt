I would appreciate it if you could correct my sentences
It's been getting colder lately here in Japan. (\"These days\" is a phrase I often hear Japanese and Korean native speakers use in their English, although in native English speakers would probably say \"lately\" or \"recently\". It's sort of the equivalent of 最近
I find Japan's summer weather disagreeable because of its high humidity and temperature
So, as the winter is coming, I'm starting to feel better
It is a very exciting season
But, before enjoying those kind of happy times, I have to do a kind of boring, 
I have a fiancee and she is finding a job.(if she doesn't have a job yet use \"a\" job, butif she has a job then use \"her\" job
It doesn't seem easy for women to find jobs in Japan
The first, most women have babies and they have to take maternity leave
Employers don't like it even if maternity leave is the right of employees
The second,  women workers likely to quit their job because of child care or the transfer of ther husbands
If a woman worker quits her job, employers have to find a new employee
Though there are many women workers who have excellent potential, employers often hesitate to hire them
It is the first time
When I first arrived in Brisbane, it was always sunny
I am missing the warm weather
It's too hard for me
My goal is an overall 7.0, but it may need to more than 1 year
English is the harder , the more difficult language 
I really hope that I will be able to speak English like a native
I also have another problem
I always practice pronounciation, but it's getting more difficult
I dont know why I can't recognize \"ea\" \"i\" ,such as, \"cheap as chips
If I said that sentence, people will hear the same pronounciation
2 months later, I am going to back to Korea
I just learned the alphabet
It is said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japanese’s, so that the Korean who study Japanese take about 1 year to speak Japanese fluently, while the other foreigners have to take 3 or 4 years or more
I found that the Korean alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese’s
How about the way to spell
And after I entered the Japanese department, I even can’t recall any English grammar that I learned before
But it’s also said that it’s very difficult to learn both of them well
One time, I had a Japanese examination
The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before see a katakana word, we just try to think of an English word and then spell it
I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reason
Then I asked my brother for advice, he said that “I like Japanese
I was acquainted with him in a Chinese chat room when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago
He is a very special person, even though we’ve met in real life yet
He is 8 years older than me but he is just a friend
He is very humorous and handsome 
He can always make me smile even when I’m in a bad mood
But in my university, at the second year of regular training, we can choose a second qualification if we want and be able to study both well
My university has about 11 foreign language departments and some other department where they teach economics, travel business, computers, and so on… If we’re learning a foreign language, we’re advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness department so that when we graduate we will have the best job
So next year, I intend to choose the English department for the second qualification
When we’re at the third year, we have a compulsory subject
It’s different from the second qualification
Because the second qualification also has economics, travel business, computers… training and it isn’t compulsory
For example, I’m learning Japanese, I have to choose one of the 10 other foreign languages
So, if next year I choose the English department, the year after I may choose Korean for second foreign language
To learn almost fluent Japanese, we have 4 years
After that, I am not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently
It’s called “the love language”, isn’t it
Do you know our Uncle Ho was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages
I can’t do it like that but I wish I could learn at least 4: Japanese, English, Korean and French
Do I have the ability to do it
I’m very worried about it
This time  we still have to test 4 Japanese skills
I’m very nervous of speaking and listening skills
It was so bad, wasn’t it? The essay topic this time will be random
I’ll have to write anything in Japanese as the topic requests
Life is short
to try hard
We wore wedding dresses despite the absence of our bridegrooms
WishI send my best wishes for to her..  I know this might sound strainge, but this is a very common usage in English - to send someone good wishes on a birthday or other occasion
That is Those are my mother’s pictures, which were taken when she was younger.  Young is also correct, but the word younger is more polite, as it doesn't imply she is so old now
Isn't she beautiful
My computer’s CD ROM was broken so I can’t install Japanese font
I’ll try to continue this diary one near day next day
There is a big difference between the east and the west, when comes to education. I always admired how the westerners educate their posterity, their method is so gentle and kind, full of love and meaning, whereas the Asian method is rather more of violence more violent, for example the Chinese people believe that a child should be educated with rods
Countless beatings from their parent is believed to be capable of forging a successful child! That's how I was brought up at least. My parent always tell me how much they love me, although they served me with rod every time I committed a wrong doing. However, when comes to the western way of parenting, it sounds like a fairy tale to me. For example, the western parents always said this to their child if they happened to be repudiate, the parent will say this \"go to your room!\" This is something that will never happen in an Asian family
Maybe our parents would never realize the trauma they had inflicted on us!"
How successful was the League of Nations in establishing peace during the 1920s
The League of Nations was an organization formed to improve the lives and working conditions of the people around the world, to work for peace through disarmament and to uphold and enforce the Treaty of Versailles
The League was successful in establishing peace during the 1920s by discouraging aggression towards other countries through negotiation. The League also planned to provide collective security through a community of power, for example in the case of Silesia, where the League settled a dispute between Germany and Poland through a plebiscite. Another example is the Aaland Islands, where after an investigation the League managed to settle a dispute between Sweden and Finland. The League was also successful in improving living standards. For example they provided direct aid and welfare to the people in need around the world. One of their famous acts is the repatriation of 400,000 WWI prisoners, whom they employed them to kill mosquitos to prevent malaria and also to prevent leprosy. They also provided economic experts to help Austria and Hungary, as well as establishing the International Labour Organization
As Three of the most powerful nations in the world did not participate in the League of Nations: they are Germany
Russia and the United States. The two most powerful countries in the League, Britain and France, wanted to recover from their economic loss in WWI so they showed no enthusiasm to get involved. The League failed to establish disarmament, first in 1923 and then in 1931, both times because of Britain and Germany's unwillingness to cooperate. However they did arrange a conference in 1928 where the Kellog-Briand Pact, which was an act of the League's assembly outlawing war, was signed by 23 nations and supported by 65 countries and which outlawed war
However the League was unsuccessful because it largely failed to achieve most of their disarmament were not achieve
The greatest achievement of the League was its work on social issues. No organization had ever tackled these problems before; until now their campaign has been taken over by the U
N so it is a great success. However it failed to stop powerful countries starting a war, failed to establish disarmament and also failed to defend \/ uphold the Treaty of Versailles. These failures gave rise to aggression by the Axis powers."

China opposes Paris' award for Dalai Lama (中国反对巴黎为达赖喇嘛授奖
China On Tuesday, China condemned the honorary citizen award from Paris for the Dalai Lama, saying it posed \"a grave interference in Sino-French relations
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said China was indignant and resolutely opposed Paris's award for the Dalai Lama made despite China's opposition. (when a word ends in 's' you only have to put '    [For example James' bike is nice
Such a move stirs strong indignation among the Chinese people,\" Qin said, noting that inevitably, it would severely undermine the cooperation between Paris and Chinese cities, and gravely disturb China-France relations
He said, China held a clear, persistent and firm position over the Tibet issue, which was related to China's core interests and major political concern. he said
Qin urged Paris to stop interfering in China's internal affairs,and immediately correct its wrong-doing
Qin said that this move by the Paris government gravely damaged the city's image among the Chinese.Qin said
A poll on the website of the Global Times found more than 87 percent of voters firmly opposed the Paris' move
Paris should bear all the blame, Qin said, urging Paris to take the right attitude towards the Chinese people's voices, and stop its offence to the Chinese people, in a bid to create an essential condition for the cooperation with Chinese cities
The agenda for the dialogue will includes topics ranging from energy conservation and environmental protection, to finance and agriculture
Since it was first convened in 2007, the China-Japan high level economic dialogue has proven to be their most important mechanism for discussions on major economic concerns, and important regional and global economic issues
Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said, \"I think we two sides can make joint efforts in the following 5 aspects
Chen said, \"China's trade deficit to Japan was 34 and a half billion US dollars. (You could say 34.5 billion US dollars

So my friend and I went to see it

I could switch the car to another car
I thought I would need a navigation system on the car
Finally I could meet my friend 
at LA."

I began to learn English when I was about 16 years old
I have had English for about four years english now
For four weeks I was in the UK to learn English
I was in Cambridge and learned a lot
The school I was in was the studio school
Since last year, I have had a really bad English teacher
In my opinion, my English skills have decreased since I have had this teacher
So I began to learn Japanese by myself
I learned more Japanese then English last year
I don't have a Japanese teacher, but I think I learned more Japanese than English since I have had this English teacher
At the moment, I can write all the kana and about 200 kanji
But just the meanings and how to write them
I think it's easier to learn step by step
So I learn the vocabulary, grammar, and the meanings of the kanji
Also, I listen to JapanesePod101
It's very helpful because I don't have a Japanese teacher
The pronounciation is very difficult to learn without anyone who can speak japanese
While I am learning Japanese, I don't want to forget English, so I write here to improve english
My English teacher can't really help me
I am affraid that I am not good enough to write in Japanese
I just can only speak some short sentences like 'おげんきですか
You see, I write all in Kana because I didn't learned a lot of kanji
I hope I will learn a lot of Japanese

Japanese would say  \"今夜は月が綺麗ですね\"(which means \"The moon looks more beautiful tonight\") instead
I think what he meant was that \"love\" is the feeling that makes the moon looks brighter than the moon you (usually) see by yourself
Continuing from my previous journal entries
After the cake buffet, we saw off 名無しさん and  Porschla off at the bus station
Really? I didn't know! :D
So they must have had a great time there
They had a free day on Friday because their flight would depart on Saturday afternoon. (It was Saturday morning, actually
When they got down the buss, they looked really tired
I thought it was because of the long mountain route\/road
I had other choices in mind
But I decided to take\/bring them to Atsuta Shrine
So many people go there for a stroll
I turned on the TV immediately
My recent favorite soap opera starts at 13:30. (If you want to talk about a soap opera that is currently\/recently a favourite, then it's usually more natural to keep it in a separate sentence from a time reference. For example: Recently I have a new favorite soap opera. It starts at .... Or: My favourite soap opera at the moment is ..... It starts at ..... 
So I felt regret oversleeping. (Or simply: So I felt bad about oversleeping. Or: I wish I hadn't overslept
of the drama!! (You don't need to say this, since you've already explained it. 
There was a particularly memorable line. (To emphasize that it was really special
That was, \"Our happiness shouldn't be bought at the sacrifice of any of us.\" (I'm not sure what the translation is, but something that may sound more natural is: Our happiness shouldn't be attained at the cost\/sacrifice of others
What did you do with your mother
I went to the a revolving sushi bar named \"ざぶん\" with my family and mother's mom and father's mom
There were lots of \"moms
I had (so) many bottles of sake. (The 'so' is for emphasis ;p
Don't fall down! ;p
Maybe you guys don't have a culture to have a leisurely bath! (that's right... 
I need to go and buy it when I'm in Japan then! 
This sentence is grammatically correct, but a bit ambiguous as it can either mean 1) your friend is sick and hospitalized, or 2) your friend is working or for some reason, is in a hospital although s\/he is not sick
There is a park between the nearest train station and the hospital he is in
It was raining heavily, and I was listening to music on full volume
While I was walking through the park, somehow my wallet fell out of my pocket
When I realized, I broke out in a cold sweat
There were some cash cards, credit cards, my driver license, and other stuff in it
But my wallet was taken to the police station by a kind gentlemen
Somehow the police officer remembered it
I'm writing this journal entry using my iphone on the train
Today we are having a forum about the research that my lab conducting
This time it's a badminton tournament
All of the lab members including professors are gonna take part in the tournament
So this has a aspect which is entertainment for the professors!意訳ですが：So even the professors can enjoy themselves in such a sports event
I'm going to change\/transfer my train now
I will be back at Lang8 at tonight if I am not exhausted
it's not gone! I just corrected it 
Anyway, I got to keep my spirits up
What did you do for your mom
We just finished took the graduate school entrance test last week
After the test, we had an interview
During the interview, the interviewer told us if we did well or not at the test
So, what I have to do now is only doing research
By the way, I have a something to ask you
Do you believe that there is the a right thing in this world
Like the moon, things look different by from the different viewpoints you see from
We can't see the whole things at once
A Scientific speaking, we can only perceive by the reflection of lights
What I wanna say is, a right thing might be not be right thing for others
So, I bought a book called \"A Theory of Justice
I haven't read it more than 2 pages yet
I'm trying to finish this book within this month
I also started attending English conversation class
There are so many things to write about
One journal entry is not enough to finish up writing about my these days!"
名無しさん, her friends named Porschla, みよきちさん, atukiくん and his friend なつえ and me
The motivation for this trip was 名無しさん's journal entry
She wrote that she was planning to visit Takayama with her friend 
Takayama is in the northern part of Gifu prefecture and that is close to my hometown
Then me and other 2 of her Lang8 friends decided to serve as guides for them
The rendezvous was at the Golden Clock in Nagoya station at 10 a.m
This was absolutely our absolute first time to meet  each other. 
What do you mean by this
So I ordered a bowl of rice topped with fillet pork cutlet and 味噌 sauce
And it was excellent
That pork fillet was tender and went well with the sauce
And I love it! In almost all of the sentences that you wrote, you should replace \"that\" with \"it\". It's a little hard to explain why, though. In this sentence, \"And I love that\" really means \"And I love the fact that 味噌 is a special product of Aichi Prefecture.\" \"that\" really refers to an entire sentence, or an entire idea. On the other hand, \"And I love it!\" really means \"And I love 味噌\". In this case, \"it\" refers to the subject (person, place, thing) of the preceding sentence. So, if you write about the same subject in multiple sentences, you should use \"it\" instead
Tomorrow I will continue to write about this sightseeing trip
I am so glad that I could come back to here
I have been having some tough days. (More natural suggestion: I've been having a rough time lately. Or: I've had a rough few days
I couldn't stand without pain killers until a couple of days ago
I still have big holes in my mouth, but I can eat anything I want now
It's 2 a.m. here now
I went to the otolaryngology (no clue what this is but ok!) after school today
I had to wait there about 2 hours there
Then I went to the dispensary to get some medicines for on the prescription which the doctor wrote me. (I don't believe this sentence is ungrammatical but it is definitely odd sounding to me
Then I had a dinner at home and talked with my friend on the phone for an hour and half
Then, I chatted with Mimi for a hour. (or \"I then chatted
So I don't have much time to write this journal entry because I have to get ready to go school before I go to bed. (Again, not necessarily ungrammatical but this can also be read as you are planning to go to school tonight BEFORE you go to bed. Perhaps something like \"I have to get ready for school tomorrow and go to bed.\" That would clear all possible confusion
So this time, I will just introduce my favorite song
Actually, it was my first time to go around Tokyo since I was in the 3rd your year of junior high school
I stayed at my friend's house. He are will be going to university in Tokyo in 3 days' time, and we had drinks drank every night
I got home from Tokyo on Friday evening 
And I left my house and went to my other friend's house right away
Most of my old pals gathered in his house and we drank had drink all the night
I mean it\/ It's real
Actually, my friend did it. (Not me
I was just watching the whole thing while he was having a difficult time assembling it
I had pulled out my wisdom teeth yesterday!better:I had my wisdom tooth pulled out yesterday
It still hurts so bad badly
So the pain killer is necessary all day.so I need painkillers all day
I hope it will get recovered by this weekend at the latest
Right now, my face is puffed up like a balloon
I really wanna skip the classes on Monday
I still have  a slight headache and stuffy nose
And I feel dizzy (too). (it's better to add \"too\" at the end of this sentence to make it more natural, because you mentioned previously that you had a headache and a stuffy nose
I think the fever  has  already passed away
Anyway, I can't stay on the in bed anymore
I bought a couple of books about  the TOEFL
Have anyone taken  the TOEFL before
I'm thinking to of taking that test this summer
The TOEFL has a writing section
So I'm going to write journal entries along the policy that are in accordance with the requirements (?)  of  the TOEFL writing section
I have to finish some reports tonight
I couldn't bear it! 
Smoking is similar to summoning the Mephistopheles
It will give you a nominal relief
But you will have to repeat the spell every 4 hours
But I know
I live in 1000km away from the temblor's epicenter. 
Nonetheless I felt shakiness in my house. [We'd probably say it this way:] Nonetheless I felt my house shake. 
I pray for that damages won't extend any more."
I experienced so many things which were impossible in Japan
And now she is a freshman at Luther College
I hadn't ridden a bullet train in a while. (Use \"I had never\" when it was your first time ever
So I was worried that I might not see her...(I think it's more natural to use \"I was worried that ... [bad thing will happen]\". Or maybe \"I was worried about whether I could see her or not
Today was the first day of my lab's school year
This is the website of the lab. (This is the lab's website.\/Here's a link to the lab's website
The areas of research of this laboratory are Electric Power Equipment and High Electric Field phenomenon
I'm in my 4th year at Nagoya University now. (I'm a 4th year student at Nagoya University now.\/ I'm a NAgoya University senior now
I'm inexperienced and my research competence\/skill is not high enough
So I am going to knock myself out to learning as much as possible from great professors and seniors
My dream is to be a professor in the field of Electric Power Equipment and Asset management! (Both field or area are ok in this context, but region is probably best avoided
To realize my dream, I must do my best!!! (Also: I must do all that I can! I need to do my utmost!)"
I hope everyone had a great Christmas Day
The name of the band is \"celandaine
He is the lead vocalist of the band
And he also writes songs for the band
In a band competition which all teenage bands of Japan could enter, they were awarded first prize
So I am not sure if that name is proper English
Today I went to the YFU meeting for the long-term staying overseas students who are staying long-term here in Japan
They arrived here 2 months ago
And they are going back this winter
Wow... I can't. 
We talked about why they decided to come to Japan and what they liked of Japan
Most said that they really love the food of Japanese food
Fortunately, the exhibition of the Japanese art exhibition was held on the same floor of where we were having the meeting
And it was for free for all to admit. (Or, \"admittance fees were not required\"\/ \"It was free of charge
So I brought everyone into the exhibition
So if you blow at it, it will be destroyed
And he took the pictures of us for free (too
And then they treated us to matcha and cha-gashi by courtesy of them
It was a really good experience
And I really appreciate their many kindness to us!"
I get a cold
I get a cold. (are u still cold? get or it passed already --> got
So I take a day off to write a journal entry or So I'll take a day off to write a journal entry
Good night, everyone
I'm going to bed\/I'm going to sleep
I don't like  the rainy season
Many individuals believe that nuclear power plants are a considerable danger
The Chernobyl disaster left unforgettable damages due to the explosion of the plant and  the release of the radiation
Many countries, however, decided to reconsider of nuclear power plant development
So I wrote few lines along  related to the textbook
It was really hard to write an academic writing.  (It was really hard to write academically
But if I keep writing like this, I think I will get  a good score at on the TOEFL test
もちろんですよ！頑張ってください！＾＾
The weather forecast said the rain will go on for continue this week
I think it's a little bit early to set in for  the rainy season  to begin
I'm thinking of managing my daily schedules in English

What do you think
I bettered my own TOEIC score! (More natural may be: I beat my own TOEIC score record
The day before yesterday, the results of the 153th TOEIC test was announced on the internet
The score of the TOEIC will be converted into the score of the English section
And 905 points will be converted to 100 out of 100
What I meant is I am finally ready to concentrate upon the entrance examination for graduate school 
We held a 2 day orientation of the YFU exchange student program
I met some former friends from high school
We talked about our senses of value. (More natural: We talked about our values\/values in life
And we talked about our future careers
My grandpa finally passed away. (Even if it's expected it's probably better to avoid saying 'finally' because it gives the impression that not only were you waiting, but also hoping for it to happen. And that's not so nice. 
I am going to see the cherry blossoms with my lab members and professors!!!"
I was transferred to the 3rd year of Nagoya University from Toyota National College of Technology last year
So last year I experienced my first campus life
At the beginning of the school year, I had almost no friends at the university
But now I am aurrounded by many friends, seniors and juniors
I received so many greetings yesterday. (It's good to remember with 'i' and 'e' that: \"It's i before e, except after c.\" It's a rhyme we learned in school. 
From friends, family, friends in US, my host family and so on
Those made me realized I have been supported by so many people
And those gave me plenty of motivation! (It depends on if you're talking about the people or the congratulations you received. If people, then \"And those really gave me a push (when I needed it)!\" or if the congrats: \"And those really pepped me!\" for example
I am going to set about taking the math section of the entrance examination for graduate school tomorrow
It's been 2 months since my last journal entry
Time flies very\/really fast
I've been through so many \"exciting\" experiences these days. (\"stimulative\" is a little unnatural here
But this margin is too small to contain all my experiences
Fermat's theorem! 
I've been concentrating on my graduation research (recently), staying overnight in the lab twice a week. (adding \"recently\" makes the sentence smoother
And the pains! ;p
Going to an Amusement park with exchange students
I had to do so many tough stuffs like doing a presentation in front of all of the lab members and professors
But they never stay long enough in my brain
I feel contented myself by reading the English, but in actual fact, I learned nothing
I guess I need to put more focus on studying English
The highlight of the rides is the roller coaster called \"Steel Dragon
It was in the Guinness Book as the world's tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster
Some of the beams? were broken
I am not good at such rides machines
But one of them the exchange students who is from Michigan really likes those kind of things
So I was dragged along too
I chickened right in front of the platform once
I had been having a fear for a long time
It was way more fun funner than I thought
It's been a while since the last time I wrote in my journal
I'm sorry about I haven't been able to give you any help for a month
But I'm done with all of my exams
This means the beginning of 2 months of spring break
I'm trying to write a jounal at least once in aevery 3 days
And I'll try to give you what any help I can
By the way, I found some beautiful lines written by Miyazawa Kenji
But I don't know how to put it them into English
Flowers raining in the sky, we call them stars
Stars shining on the earth, we call them flowers
Something like this that
What the Japanese government said and what the foreign press said differed in many accounts
Maybe the Japanese government has been trying to control information to avoid a panic
but this backfired. and
many people are disoriented. or possibly \"disconcerted
The Tokyo Electric Power Company was one of the most secured reliable large companies
but that day, it fell off failed
Now, nothing is certain."
In addition to the my last journal entry, my birthday happens to coincide with the end of the cherry blossom season, so all the cherry trees are in full blossom
I went out to the park with my friends to enjoy a picnic under the cherry blossoms on my birthday
The park was congested  with many people. (It's okay to use 'congest', although I personally find it a little weird. Another word to use is \"crowded
So it was not as if I could enjoying the pretty gardens
But people were having fun with beer bottles in their hands and the foods of nearby stalls
As the time went by, people are spending lesser time to appreciate nature. 意訳ですが
But they still have hearts to love and enjoy having fun with friends! (I don't quite understand this sentence
this was not what I was going to write
So, see you then!"
【PR】My best friend's band is releasing their major debut album on 4\/21
He is one of my best friends
We went to the same school and had been in the same class for five years
I wrote a journal entry about him and his band a while ago
At that time, I asked you for some help for the name of the major debut album on his behalf
He hopes his songs will be the fire and warmth in your heart
Enjoying our lives is \"an\" important thing
But while we live in \"a\" each nations, there are responsibilities and obligations
I really \"have to\" reflect \"up\"on myself about this."
The subject was \"Is it possible that each of the people all over the world to use the same amount of energy that a Japanese uses now
At no distant future a time may come when people will use up all the oil
But if the blade is damaged by lightning and needs replacement, the wind must be slight enough to undertake the repair work safely
This means that operating a wind power generator requires constant and powerful wind but it must be stopped periodically
So I think I should go to bed a bit than earlier tonight
I will write more about the energy problem sometime soon
I have appointment with doctor tomorrow morning
So I have to finish it tonight and leave him to turn it tomorrow morning
I haven't dinner yet
Sorry that I've been unable to correct your journals these days.(´；ω；｀
So correcting your journal entries from that computer is really hard to do.(´・ω・
So I'm thinking I will bring the laptop computer which I usually use at home to the lab, and leave it there for some time
Furthermore, my graduation research could be a kind of simulation stuff,I think. (Sorry, don't know what you are trying to say
YES
But I decided to do it to save my money
But it's gonna be much more powerful than the ones made by manufacturers
I'm thinking of using some wire shelves which I've kept outside
They are covered badly with rust so bad
I have a BBQ and hiking (to do) this weekend
I guess this is gonna take a while."
I didn't have a refrigerator
and so, I used to take my meals at the school cafeteria, or just buy some convenience food
And by gigantic city, I mean (it's) Tokyo
Feng-Sui derives from China, long time ago
But has been used in Japan since medieval times for a long time
Where the queer monk, 天海, rearranged the whole city of Edo under the Feng-Shui's doctrine
To make the long story short, he changed the names of places around the castle
He also placed many temples and Japanese style gardens under the Feng-Sui style
Though many of Japanese are not aware of it
I was at the \"Tacos Party\" last night
All the participants works for YFU as a volunteers
The second picture is of the handmade tiramisu
One of them had the birthday recently had his\/her birthday
It was not only tacos party, but also her birthday party
It's been a week since the last time I wrote a jounal
Last Thursday, I was present at the party.Last Thursday, I went to a party
That party was aimed for learnig English conversation!The party was to help us practice English conversation
ThisThese kind of parties are held periodically
But this was my first time to take part in one
And I waited for them about 30 minutes underin the cold wether
We could drink as much many drinks as we wanted
I drunk littersdrank litres of Gin and Tonic
We onlyjust had English conversations
But also it was fun to talk with Japanese people who are interested in English
I forgot about that this was my firtst time and enjoyed speaking English
Those pictures were taken at there
I am the guy who is accidentally kissing with the 42 year old guy in the second picture.) 
Around 22:30, people started leaving. if not they were missing the last trains.If they didn't, they would miss the last trains
Then wemoved to the next place
We walked about 10 or 20 minutes with a straggeringly!Lol - i don't know what you're saying here! 
We talked about many funny things (mostly indecent things) at there
We stayed at there until morning
I have TOEIC test in a months
I didn't  write a journal entry last night.ｐ(≧ヘ≦。)ｑ
But the computer which was provided for me by the lab was really slow
I tried to uninstall some applications and did a virus check (too). (It will sound more natural if you add \"too\" at the back of your sentence
It took a couple of hours. (This is a set phrase, \"a couple of ...\", \"a set of...\", \"a dozen of...\" etc etc
Then the workshop started
When I got to home, it was (already) past 10 p.m. (＞、＜
I still could write a journal entry but I was too exhausted
I need to be more steady
And sleeps for only an hour
He says his bed is too comfortable so
He might sleep for more than an hour if he sleeps in the bed
I don't know if an hour is enough for me
I feel proud of Japan's culture
I also feel sad for the losses of that culture
The Golden Week starts tomorrow
There are many different theories regarding what motiveates human beings to act in the ways in the what they do
I agree with the latter position because all human societal activities are directly or indirectly involved with other people around us. これの方がいいと思うけど。
Ultimately any kind of human actions are is molded by affection to from others
And I'm in the middle of the section about \"Introduction.\" hehe!　（省略しても大丈夫だと思うよ）
Now I'm writing a paper about the currents state and futeure prospects of the energy supprly in Japan
格好いいな！＾＾難しいトピックじゃない？
The more I learn, the more obvious it is that the development of the nuclear power plant is reasonable

Most of people say Eminem is one of the coarsest rappers in the history of music because of his behavior, words and his songs which are studded with insults
He has put affronts upon affronted\/insulted many celebrities in his songs such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and even his ex-wife. \"Put affronts upon\" might not be incorrect (I didn't check) but it sounds awkward
A song which is in on his 3rd album, however, shows those of his insults might be not his real intention. I think people usually say that a song is on an album, not in it
This song which you might have not heard of is named \"Hailey's Song
Hailey\" is his daughter's name
Please turn off or put your cellphone into silent mode while watching the show music video. (I think \"show\" is for something longer --like a TV program
the \"Hailey's Song
There is a huge forest where no one can trespass on its holy ground in the middle of a capital city which is well-known worldwide
The priest is a direct descendant of the the world's oldest dynasty, and he is also the only emperor who exists in the whole world now
There are three holy durables called \"The Three Sacred Treasures
Those are owned by the emperor and have been passed from generation to generation
Each of them is being guarded closely at the ancient sanctuaries and they are regarded untouchable
The gigantic city itself has also been closely protected by layered magics by a  sublime wizard since it was established
So it is an artificial city defended by magic
It is of unprecedented scale and no other such city is longer in existence, evenin the cradle of the magic."

I feel like they are doing such things just for fun (only
The First thing that I want to emphasize is there is no difference between a whale and a cow
Biologically they are both classified as mammals
Do you think it can be used as a reason to not kill it\/them
We have the culture to appreciate (?) all lives equally
April 1st is the day which called known as April Fools' Day
But I am not going to be a fool in this journal
April is the beginning of school season
I graduated from Nagoya University and got the degree of Bachelor of Engineering last month
Now I'm going to graduate school at Nagoya University
I learned many things during last year
They were not only special knowledges.I also learned more than just academics
My aim of for this year is \"learn a lot, and play a lot\" by using efficient time management!"
Midterms are finally over with! (When you say \"I am over with midterms\", this actually means \"I am fed up with midterms!\" and \"I will never study for\/write a midterm ever again!\" What I wrote is closer to what you meant, I think
Finally, the mid-terms are done over now
But not for this year
This year, it means, finally I can finally focus on my research
How about, \"Optimization of strategic maintenance of electrical equipments\"? 
I have no idea how to solve\/go about doing this yet
I have only 5 months to finish this
So I have no time to repose! [Although, \"repose\" work--it sounds odd in everyday language. I think a better word to use would be \"rest
I haven't touched my electricalelectronic dictionary these days
This means I haven't used English these days for some time. 
Learning English is unavoidable for my future. (It's a bit awkward to use \"not avoidable\" where you can use \"unavoidable\" IMHO
I have to spend more time on learning\/my English! (This sounds more natural to me)"
It has been really cold until last week
In the middle of April, It's usually warm enough to go out with wearing only a long-sleeved shirt or sometimes a casual jacket over here
But on the day of last week, it was so cold that I needed to wear a down jacket even though it's already spring! (I think an exclamation mark is more suitable here ;p
Today, the professor of the energy transforming engineering class told us some of his doubts on global warming
He described it from the viewpoints of the number of the sunspots, the axis of the earth and the earth's yearly spins 
He said that the earth is facing a global cooling now (instead of global warming). (It will make your sentence more complete if you add the blue words behind
He said it will induce a rather cool summer all over the world
The weather forecast said tomorrow is gonna be cold
I just can't wait for the nice warm spring!"
We took part in it under the YFU, (the comma here makes the sentence easier to understand) which was the exchange organization that took care of me while I was staying in America
I have been told that we were supposed to explain the activities of the YFU to students  who were interested in studying abroad
We have held such a meeting last month
So we thought that this would proceed as easily as last month's meeting
But it wasn't\/didn't
Actually this event was like a kind of extracurricular activities to the highschool girls
There were a lot of other organizations such as the group of Japanese drum players, the welfare workers and a rival organization that is called AFS
But all of them were mostly for people who wanted to study abroad
So the contents of slide show\/presentation which we prepared were mostly about how to apply for the YFU exchange program, the history of the YFU and the structure of the organization
So it was a serious type of thing and wasn't a fun thing at all
The rival organization, AFS, on the other hand, was doing really fun stuff
We totally misunderstood the purpose of the event
We felt as if we were lying on a bed of thorns."
Last Saturday, we held a Christmas Party for the exchange students
There were nine exchage students staying in the Tokai area through YFU
YFU is the one of the world's largest exchange organizations
Three years ago, I went to America for a year as an exchange student through YFU
I really appreciate to them
So, to replay and express my feeling of gratitude, I'm working for YFU as a volunteer now
These exchange students are returning to their homelandhomeat the beginning of next month
So we wanted them to have one more another precious memory of Japan <to take home with them
That was why we held the christmas party
A previous YFU exchange student now runs a cafe in Nagoya, he let us use his hall for the party
It was a really nice place
It had a nice interior with cool drawings painted all over the walls
Maybe these are drawn by themselvesthey were originals
Over 30 people came to the Christmas party, it was lovely
The foreign exchange students brang their friends - their age ranged from my age to over 50
We provided them with many snacks ,juices and Japanese traditional food like Temaki-Sushi
We had a game called \" Russian roulette wasabi cream puff
Wasabi is Japanese horseradish
It is really pungent spicy
After game,we enjoyed chatting with each other and the hall rung with the sound of laughter
One of the exchange students had a birthday on that day
So we celebrated her 17th birthday with a very cute birthday cake
I hope we made an unforgettable memory for them
I want to thank everyone who helped make this such successful party. 
I parked on the street (around\/near from) the university
And (place) where I parked was only 2 meters away from the crossroad
I (had) to pay the penalty of it (for this)｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡
The fine of (illegal) parking (is\/was) ￥18000
That was) so expensive
But I (had) to accept (that\/it), otherwise I (would got) arrested
Oh man, If I didn't commit (it), I could buy another monitor (and\/or) a graphic board!!! ---> are u for real?! 
Oh, just in case, I will upload the picture of the area that you are not allowed to park
Be careful when you park your car on (the\/that) road!"
Last week we recieved a his health screening report, and it showed some unusual numerical values.*Note: Your sentences were fine, but I might write the two sentences this way
It showed some unusual numerical values
The doctor said he has the metastasis spread of cancer of all around his body
The doctor also said his days are numbered, 3 months at the most
I'm really proud of him. my grandpa
He has given me a lot of help in life
When I hoped to study abroad in America, he was the one who approved and paid all of the expenses
He also paid my tuition fees, and what's more he is saving to prepare for my graduation school fees
When I got back from one year of studying abroad, I visited my grandparents first
He took one look at me, and suddenly he stormed about my hair color
Can you yell at the grandson you haven't seen for a whole year
He couldn't overlook that I seemed to have changed my identity and lost my pride in being Japanese
So next day, I had my hair cut really short, and dyed it black
Then I visited them again and apologized
Because I think it is part of the Japanese identity
He brought me up
I have never faced such a situation before, that someone who is really close to me is dying
At first, I kind of lost my grasp of what I was facing
I couldn't think of what I should tell him
Strangely enough I haven't been terribly grieved this week
Because I was too busy with my university stuff and other work I'm responsible for
I really appriciate what he has given me
And his innermost thoughts are living in me
Of course I wasn't going to cry
I was going there relieve him
When I saw him and his gaunt face, I couldn't check the flow of tears
I've realized what I am facing, he is passing away
I couldn't tell him what I was going to say well because the tears kept interefering
And also I realized I can not possibly put my gratitude into words
I vowed to work as much as I could and contribute to the world to his face
Beyond that, I could only tell him \" Thank you for everything, everything you have given me.\" And I left his house with saying \" See you later
If I were to die tomorrow, I would feel that I haven't yet shared enough of what my grandpa has given to me. couldn't put what he had gave to me to account enough
So I decided to try to take more oppotunities to tell my friends, my juniors and you who is reading my diary, what I learned until now
And I'll try harder to leave more things in this world
I represent my honorable grandpa
I should never disgrace his honour
Today I had my third time of the English conversation class
日に一画足して9個漢字を作るという問題がとけません。
First we were given a piece of paper which is written the article (where an article was printed) but some sentences are blanked (were left blank
Then the teacher read the article to us, and we filled in the blanks. [ I had never thought about \"filled in\" and \"filled out\" before. That's the beauty (one of the beauties) of Lang-8. You see your native language in a new light! The two phrases are almost alike. I would use \"fill in\" when completing a puzzle, and \"fill out\" for a job application or for a new doctor's file, information about yourself. ] 
And we filled out (in) the blanks
雨の日も、風の日も、靴の紐。[Japanese-style pun]. I think it is punny
Oh, there is a home work (homework) due next week
Then it hit me.\" [ \"Then it hit me\" is an expression that means \"I quickly realized.\" The pun here is that both the ball and the realization that the ball looked bigger because it was coming at you so fast (the nearer the ball comes, the closer you are to getting hit with it) both \"hit you\" at once -- the ball physically hit you and the realization mentally hit you. Here's another example: \"I wondered where I had left my umbrella. I searched the house. No luck. Then \"it hit me\" (I quickly, suddenly realized) I'd left it under my car seat.\" OR, \"I was daydreaming yesterday when suddenly a great idea hit me.\" (It came to me as fast as lightning.) 
直訳：「球が近づいていたら、頭が打かられた。」\"hit me\"は「気が付く」も「ぶつかれた」もと言う意味です。
My favorite one is, \"There was a sign on the lawn at a (the) drug re-hab center that said 'Keep off the Grass
Today I went to the Atsuta shrine and the Shiratori Japanese-style garden
A Shinto shrine is a structure which is made built as the house of kami-sama
It's placed in a It's only an hour from my house but I had never been there before
I love your photos!!! 
t I felt like \"the true colors of Japan\" was were there
Can I walk on this bridge
There Here are some rules about paying homage at a shrine
2 You have to must walk on the left side of the road because its center is for only the kami-sama to walk. may walk in the center
Then tap your hands twice , bow and make a wish with your desire in your heart
At this point, After you make your wish, you shouldn't speak your wish in voice. say it outloud
These are some of the conventions of Shinto
But I saw many people who didn't follow them
Japanese-style gardens are often made in imitation of the real scenery
And this is the biggest Japanese-style garden in Nagoya which that imitated the scenery of this area
It has a quaint atmosphere
I think leaves of the trees will be really beautiful when they will turn in autumn and it must be really beautiful
It's been 2 days since I met you, my brain is full of you
Because if I touch you I think everything I've established is gonna collapse
That fear could alienate you
If I had got on you in my birthday suit, 
being held by you until the moon set over the sea, and shared the panorama of the color of the sky
I would've not be feeling this gloom

I cannot concentrate on anything else; but I'm just so in love with you
my dear new bed."
I'm not in a good shape
This morning I woke up with a horrible stomachache
So I ran into the bathroom as soon as I left the bed. 他の言い方： So I rushed into the bathroom the moment I left my bed\/woke up. (This is slightly more natural but your sentence is okay too
I didn't feel good since last Saturday
This happens periodically\/occasionally
It's like, only the air is being thin only around me becomes very thin
I can't center my focus\/concentrate on my studying\/revision
I made a promise to myself! 
On the day of my birthday, I decided to never fail to write a journal entry everyday
This was way I was in a hurry last night
It is the biggest priority for me to keep my promises
But I will keep it up
I will try to persevere through!!! (Using \"undaunted\" is a little weird here

I have watched many movies. [or \"have seen

So I don't know how to comment on it
Actually, Radiohead’s Last Flowers is used as an ending song for the film
I've heard the news that Hollywood is remaking it with Daniel Radcliffe and Nicole Kidman
I'm sure it will fail
Because I'm sure that it is impossible to make this movie except in Japanese\/in Japan\/for a Japanese audience
What I'm trying to say is, even if you are a great chef, you can't make a Japanese dish with American seasoning
Ah, I can't quite express my feelings
There is only one thing that I am sure of
It is that I am glad that I could watch this movie
After we had lunch at 矢場とん, we went to the Nagoya Castle!　(You don't need 'the' since Nagoya is considered the name of the castle.) 
Perhaps I had been there before, but I didn't remember anything of it
They looked realistic. (They looked like the real thing
Then we moved to 栄 and went to the restaurant which serves a cake buffet
They served more than 15 kinds of cakes and we could eat as many as we wanted! (I think in all cases, instead of 'serve\/served', I would use 'have\/had' instead. Serving implies that it is handed over to you in person. And usually that's not the case with a buffet. 
They served cream puffs, custard puddings, short cakes, and many other cakes which I had never seen before
The clerks ,customers and everyone in the house sang birthday song toghether
We had plenty of cakes and a great time
Then we took 名無しさん and Porschla to the bus station and they departed for Takayama
They had a free day in Nagoya because the flight reserved would departure this afternoon

How to Make Friends Titles are capitalized. 
When I was young, I found it very easy to make a new friend
However, it's more and more hard now
Why?, I think it is because of the lack of trust
When we are little, we even don't know what is right and what is wrong
In the other words, we can say we are childlish
But when we grow up, everything changes
In a word,I think the only way to solve this problem is empressement. (Empressement is a bit strange) "
But I feel very happy, because I have 
A reply to a letter 
Now I am thinking about my reply to the old lady
After the year changes, we will hear this greeting everywhere

I've decided to write my dairy in English from now on 
Yesterday I was given a lot of adzuki beans by my neighborhood
So I tried cooking the Japanese sweet, \"ZenZai\", for the first time in my life
I washed the beans and boiled them it
I didn't know that the beans expands after boiling them
As soon as my husband saw watch it them, he shouted, \"Who can eat all of this all 
oh Wikipedia taught me that Zenzai is called \"red bean soup\" 
We eat it with by chopsticks 
not a Chinese spoon."
Please list what you consider to be the most common pets that people keep. (\"owning a pet\" is OK, but \"keeping a pet\" is more natural

but also because they have helped people be watchdogs, catch mice, and much more

Today, I had a part-time job ( ｡-ω-)-ω-)-ω-) (Usually, we would say \"Today, I had work.\" We usually do not differentiate between part-time and full-time work. If you do want to specify, then in the next sentence, I would say: \"I'm working part-time as a clerk in a doughnut shop

Actually, my original name is not Don
it is Dong Chun Kim. That is my Korean name
You may feel that my whole name is not easy to pronounce, so therefore, I have abbreviated it to Don

It's nice to go to the pool during summer
But it's raining this afternoon
so we couldn't go to the pool."
I think I need to learn English
But I read English books too
because it is study I learn English from it
Japanese school's homework is very hard. The homework for Japanese school is very difficult. 
And it is a lot. There also a lot of homework to be done.

Maybe they will come to here next summer
Please tell me if I can say this sentence like this
I know I can say this sentence like this
But can I say it like this
This is the best learning method for English."
Today, I had a quarrel with a friend who I have known for about 2 years. You could say \"one of my friends\", but you add a more detailed description afterwards, so the \"my\" is not necessary. It is more grammatically correct to say \"...a friend whom I have known...\" but this may sound too precise. Very few native speakers of English use this grammar rule any more
I met with him on the yahoo chess site, and we became friends
We used to go to swimming together at the beach sometimes, and at that time we were good friends. OR We went swimming
He is a foreigner and has lived in my country for a_long time, but he cannot speak the language very well, so we usually talk in English
But I noticed that he sometimes makes bad remarks about my country, and says bad things about our people
Everytimes I heard him say things like this, it was due to a misunderstanding, and I would explain to him: \"What you said is not accurate...\" \"such things\" is a bit formal. \"I would explain\" means \"I used to have the habit of explaining
he did_not change
The reason we quarrelled each othere today is that he sometimes says sarcastic things and uses trash talk. It is ok to use trash talk sometimes and to make jokes, but sometimes it hurts my feelings, so I asked him not to say such things even between friends. OR: The reason we argued with each othere is... \"sometimes it hurts\" is grammatically correct, but it places the pain in the present. You are talking about the past, so I think it would be better to say \"sometimes it hurt\" or \"sometimes it would hurt
But it did not work well, and our relationship finally collapsed
I do not think that we can rescue our relationship
It really is sad thing
Because It is not easy to find foreign friends in my country
so I was happy to have him as my friend. I have changed the wording so that you don't repeat the same expression. The meaning is still the same
I know that different countries have different customs, philosophies, and all that, \"and all that\" is rather casual speech. Coming immediately after a serious word like \"philosophies\" it implies \"this is a serious subject, but I don't want to make it heavy
so I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt in order to maintain our friendship. If you \"give someone the benefit of the doubt\" it means that you are not sure if the person is right or wrong (there is a doubt in your mind) but you decide to agree with the person anyway
But I couldn't stand what he said about me and about my country. \"I couldn't stand\" means that it made you too angry to remain friends. If you are talking about the reason for your quarrel today, then it would be better to say \"But today, I couldn't stand what he said... (and so we had a quarrel)\". If you mean that, in the past, you didn't appreciate what he said, but that it was not enough at the time to make you angry, then you need a slightly softer expression. For example: \"I found it hard to accept what he said... (but I did accept it)\". 
Of course I am not a perfect person, and I have my faults, but I couldn't accept what he said
So our relationship has collaped
Thanks for reading this
and if you have a simmiler similar experience, tell me something about your notion. (Instead of \"tell me something about your notion\", try \"tell me what you think\" or \"tell me what you think about this
I taught English to my junior high shcool studnet school students and I found this in the dictionary
walk' has the meaning 'to make something walk'. (or, \"walk\" can also mean \"to make something walk

but I did not know this that it also has the meaning 'to make something walk' like in that example
when I am teaching English, I am also taught a new things by my students.
Today I got to know about this site at a Korean internet cafe
Many friends would be able to correct my diary entries, and I would be able to correct a Korean learner's entry too

Today, I went shopping to buy a key ring, which has a sample food, with my friend
What is “Sample foods”
It is a fake of meals or foods like the photo above
In Japan, there is usually a showcase of sample foods in front of a restaurant. 
They are very similar to real meals
I have heard that foreign tourists are surprised to see them
And, it is not cheap, a small key ring costs over 700 yen(about 7 U
It is because they are handmade
A professional sample-food makers make each of them by their hands
We went to buy it for our native teacher from Urudu
He is leaving from Japan in this winter
So we wanted to give him something very Japanese

I had to translate a poem, 'Lines Left upon a Seat in a Yew Tree' by Wordsworth, into Japanese
I always struggle with the translation especially when it comes to the poetry
English is a very useful language when you try to express your feelings because one word has a lot of meanings, but when you try to analyse a poetry or something, it's so hard to find out what a word really means, I think
I don't like to mention anymore about my studies for now
I love both beer and wine, but recently beer doesn't suit me (anymore
Maybe it's because I'm not a young enough to drink a lot of beer anymore
It was a wine from Barcelona because I remembered one of my friends from Catalonia recommended it to me one day
I'm not sure if there is a person (who is) reading this. 【は～い！いるよ】
If you read this, I'm sorry my diary is not an interesting one, but I would like to recommend you the bottle of wine about which I mentioned above

I can't find any good songs in English

I wish it's song is famous. I want famous songs
Because I don't know almost  any English songs. (you could leave out \"Because\" and it would sound more natural
It's called \"ANGELS AND DEMONS
I am going to take pleasure in it. (\"enjoy it\" sounds more natural than \"take pleasure in it

Also, I want to read new books that Murakami Haruki wrote

Trip to Hong Kong
In fact, my wife comes from Hong Kong
We haven't visited her hometown in years. (Is this what you meant
In the beginning, I could enjoy western styles of foods like bread, cheese, and pizza, but after some time, I started to miss Korean foods so much
However, Korean foods were quite expensive and it was hard to find Korean restaurants
I think a lot of foreign people face similar difficulties in Korea if they come from small countries
They have something like congee, a lot of noodles, and many sea-oriented foods (\"seafoods
I still remember a course of 12 dishes we had at a banquet in Hong Kong."
I started to study English during my first year of the middle school. (More typical would be to name the grade\/form(? for British English; I'm an American), as in \"I started studying English in the sixth grade
It was very\/rather late compared to students these days. (\"Compare to,\" \"contrast with
Now they start to learn English at a much earlier age--even in the preschool or kindergarten
That may be the reason my conversation skills are not as good as my reading and writing skills. (Haha don't ask me why it's usually in the plural; it just is. 
I think any language should be acquired at an early age, at least before the child is 10 years old; otherwise, it will be a difficult task for him to speak the language as fluently as native speakers do. (Good job on getting this sentence structure correct.)"
Hopefully, I can improve my English writing skills and help other people with their Korean writing."
The This ritual came comes from the Chinese Confucianism
We have grown up reading some Chinese novels like \"Sam-Kuk-Ji\", and \"Seo-U-Ki.\" Even some old people were very proud of saying they read the book series for several times
Some people have thought believe that the Chinese have a bigger body are physically larger than Koreans. because we are in different ethnic groups
Around 10 years ago, I could have the had my first chance to meet Chinese, first, people from both Taiwan and then from mainland China
They spoke a language I could never didn't understand, which made me so wonder how the people from of our two nations were able to communicated for several thousands of years,  and at how much our so many cultures shared.could be transferred between two countries
Frankly, I got impression that they were poor and little tiny, but I started to enjoy their food, especially ones food from the \"Schezan\" area."

Hi everyone  I want to speak English, I hope you can help me."
Today is a holiday and I don't go to have school
I feel was so happy ^ ^ but now feel I'm so bored
Intro
Hi
I am new here
I'm trying to practice my English writing skills
I guess I have to come up with a subject that I need to write about and
Hopefully it is an interesting one
What I'm having a problem with in English is when to use \"the\" properly
As I write more in English, I hope to learn the right way to use \"the\" in the a sentence
For example, \"I browsed to a website, and   ordered  something
if  assume  here  that  it  was  a teddy bear  doll)  
So  I  wanted  to  call  them
If  I  say,  \"Hello  my name  is … 
I  am  a  Japanese

So  I  made  my  own English  expression: \"Hello
When  I  ask  someone about  this, everyone says
Natives  seldom  say'As  for…' in  like cases like these.\" [Nope, we don't
Is there no expression like this? [Not used in the same way. In English, we'd normally set the topic with a full cluse. \"I ordered a teddy bear two weeks ago.\" That sets the topic like について in Japanese. Then we'd say \"But I haven't heard anything about it since then

 The earthquake forecast ,2011,3,14
Please laugh at me and call me a fool
I made a conclusion about the relation between the earthquake and planet location
The  last year I wrote an entry about (I may have deleted it.) the statistics of potential global energy 
I researched the connection but I couldn't find
the exact frequency about between figures and earthquake
I researched this for a while, but because of this one exception I was unable to find the connection. 
The  last year I wondered if the big earthquake happened within
the highest and lowest numbers I gathered
But even now, I can not fully place my trust in these statistics
But the Big earthquake in 2010, and the one in Kobe and so on happened to occur at within one month of each other
I have already researched it 
Although it may be long ,the following is my conclusion 
① When universal global potential energy was around its highest or lowest ,the earthquake energy may have a tendency to increase
② The seabed fault(=slit) ,which is compensately vertical against mass circulation, moves (this is an assumption
③ Some patterns occasionally arise within the dates, but it is too difficult to find an exact correlation. 
※② is still suspicious 
※About ①, a few exceptions could not be found through this method
Please put your own thoughts into this as well. 
Thank you for reading this

Hello everybody
Good Morning! I am from Thailand. My name is Jirawut. I have decided to practice writing in English here. I hope it will improve my English. I hope someone would help me. Next time I would write about beautiful places in Thailand
So all classes were cancelled
I want to go to school tomorrow
I hope it is sunny!"
Waiting for him is what she hates the most
She looks again at the old clock
The silence is surrounding her, and she can can't help trembling while she thinks about him
The living-room living room is cold, so is she
Her voice is a whisper that disappears into the living-room living room like a dream does when the night is over
She can can't stand it anymore and turns on the tv, and her eyes got become fixed on the screen
Breathless, she finally arrives there to find him putting taking his shoes off and she’s unable to control herself and holds him so tightly that he can't breathe
Smiling, the boy kisses her head and pulls her away softy “It’s late, you should be sleeping, not waiting for me” he says tenderly “You know I won’t be sleeping until you’ll be here you're here.\" Narrowing his eyes, the boy walks through the corridor until he realizes the TV is still on
In silence, he crosses the door and his eyes glued on the screen
There, he holds her tightly making her smile
“Now that you’re here I can sleep”
I'm alive
I'm alive

I'm hardly ever active on here, but I always check my inbox, messages, and watch all the new submissions
I don't like this place, it is so different from the blogs that I have used before and it can't be open under other browsers except IE
All I feel here is sadness and nostalgia
However, I'm sure I'll upload stuff, and try to comment
All I do is stalk and +fav these days
I am an extremely positive soul now. A lot has changed, a lot has happened, a lot has made me realize where I'd been going wrong with for a very long time
I feel my life is a lot more fulfilling and just generally better
I love growing and learning, there is no better feeling then being able to look at yourself, at how you were, and how you are now, and see the positive changes you are able to implement upon yourself through time and experience
No matter how society changes, there are things which haven't changed through times; the sense of following rules, morality, public spiritness, consideration towards others, the upholding of human rights, the awe in things which have powers beyond human-beings and the love for our hometown's nature and culture
Education is being needed to foster these social characters and enrich human minds according to each of the children development stages
A Long time has passed since I wrote a the last diary before...OR ...since I last wrote a diary
As I wanna be a teacher, I definitely need to improve my English skills, especially in writing and speaking skills
Is it possible that I can improve with just by simply writing n writing, like this way? a lot in here
If you took bothered to correct my English on this website in here, how would I learn from it
Just watch read and say thanks
Or should I remember all mistakes (every mistake
But I'm kind of depressed and am upset, not knowing what to do..I'm kind of depressed and upset = I'm kind of depressed and I'm kind of upset

Music preference are varies among on people. Or you can say \"Music preference depends on various people
Each person has their own preference of music) 
Well, I'm not a good speaker in either English or Japanese. (You use either in negative sentences and both in positive sentences
At the moment, I have forgotten what a real conversation is like
It's going to be a long story
Anyway, i can't enjoy conversations, whoever I talk to
My mind wanders
How do you overcome these feelings
We went to one of my favourite restaurants in Sannomiya where we ate Gyoza and Chinese dumpling
I'll tell you about it
During my class, my students had to give their presentations
First, I'll explain about this class
Well this class is an International class
So some of them are very skilled in their use of English and they are even better than I am
This class has 4 teachers including myself
So my role is a kind of easy
I usually help them with their computers
So I don't usually use English in this class, which was a kind of relief for me
After they finished thier presentations, the other teachers started giving comments and feedback about their presentations
I didn't expect that I would have to give comments in front of them
So when the other teacher asked me to give comments suddenly, I got so nervous 
Ah, I enjoyed it very much
I regret that I couldn't speak English freely and give longer, more decent and appropriate comments
I noticed that a few of them laughed at me
I want to be more fluent 
Things I am concerned about
I am worried about alot of things
So I have to concentrate on my work but, I am always sleepy, so i can't
I think some of you might say like this
You're sleepy
However, for me, it is something.(different
I get really sleepy all the time during classes
i know I should concentrate on what I am doing, but I can't
I can't even speak Japanese very well when I am sleepy and I'm Japanese
Yes I am I have to admit it's true, which is so annoying for me
This situation has happened ever since I discovered I had a mental illnes, which was 4 years ago now
Although the sickness seems to have disappeared already, I am still sleepy and tire easily
So sometimes when I teach them I really get confused with what to do or what should be done in this situation
That's the problem
I don't wanna look like a weirdo
I am wondering if the quality of my sleep is not good enough for me to function properly during the day
I really want to have some sound sleep
①Although it's gradual, various trials which seek out a reform of education have begun in schools of each area
If the ideas or devices of teachers and lecturers accord with the expectations from children and parents, these trials might have good effects
At first, I suggest it is important to let children study what to learn, how to think and how to express themselves."
Looking back on this the last 30 years, I cannot help but be surprised at the intensive changes of the suburbs of Tokyo
You cannot see the reminiscence of old fields unless you go far from the central center of the city
For our country, it's extremely important to increase mutual understandings between nations through international exchange and advertising activities in each field and it is also important to build friendly relationships based on mutual trust
I wasn't able to do my best as I was so nervous and this was partly because I realized that I was not so serious
The reason why I said I wasn't serious about taking tests is that I didn't have a specific goal for my future
It's kinda like, I felt I have been forced to do everything
It's been a big problem for me for a long time
Today when I was studying English, I realized that I wasn't eligible to become a teacher because I am not good at conversation
I think I'm not qualified to become a teacher unless I enjoy conversation
If you don't have communication skill, you shouldn't be teaching
As I came to the above conclusion this afternoon, I went to a church where I hang out a lot
There I decided to talk about what I have in mind more positively
Next time, I'm going to talk to a person who I am attracted to
There are some troublesome things for foreigners who are going to live in Japan , one of which is trouble (in understanding things) due to not being good at Japanese
It is difficult for them to deal with things like putting out garbage where there are different rules for each area, and being able to communicate well with neighbors
Today in Kobe city, we have an annual big event, the Fireworks Festival
So I am going to wear a yukata, which is traditional Japanese clothing for wearing in summertime
We need to be able to train people to state their own opinions confidently in English to foreigners ,and to explain and convince others about circumstances peculiar to Japan
Even if a teacher has a higher skill of teaching, it might often not do well if there is no connection between a teacher and a students' mind
In order for that, teacher's skillful questions and feedback are to be welcomed by children. Mutual trust must be needed as a first step."
What makes me worry about English study is that, recently the number of people who emphasize 'usefulness' on English study has been increasing and a fundamental problem of what language study means to human has been leaving
Family plays a very important role in the sound growth of juveniles.→A family plays a very important role in fostering the mind of youngsters
Parents centered family, members of which help each other, helps to foster a considerate mind towards family in child's heart.→A family, whose member cooperate with each other well, is good for developing a mind with sympathy toward family."
According to my experience, there is very little chance that something you saved, thinking it would be useful afterwards, is actually useful
The reason why we make tidy something up is because we may want to reuse it afterwards
When you actually make the effort to thrown something out, it is a very refreshing feeling."
Regarding the title; I wanted to write 'about my recent self
First, I took some interviews and passed them
And so, I'm going to be a teacher at a high school from next year
I will try hard but I am not trying too hard so that I won't be disappointed
Secondly, I went to a concert which took place in Sanomiya city
Tha band I saw was called Kirinji, which is not so famous even among Japanese
They are consist of the Horigome brothers
I have been in love with them for almost 4 years
Their music is a kind of complicated
Jazz, pop, rock, fusion, techno
everything is in it
Because of their highly sophisticated style of music, lots of professional musicians praise them
However, because it's so complicated and they wouldn't show up so often on TV or any given media, 
Thus,they are not very famous
Anyway, I am very fond of them
Although I usually don't like going to watch any concert as I can't bear standing all the time (as much as 2 hours), 
Kirinji's show was wonderful
How can they create such an exquisite music
How would you develope the listening skill of your students
It's been a long time since I wrote my last diary
The exam, which was for becoming a teacher, has finished
It was because of the interviewer's severe questions
Although it's getting cooler, the heat makes me feel listless all the time."
There are unexpectedly many are a surprisingly large amount people who believe that they can control
However, once they get sick, they would realize that they are dominated by the rule which they cannot control even their bodies
The ability to be loved by people is perhaps one of the most valuable abilities you could equip
If it were not for the your abilities, your talent, no matter how wonderful it is, might be lost on a large scale."
You were supposed to put unburnedable garbage into the specific bin, weren't you
As I wrote in my last diary, the students are so nice
Some are so cute that I would like to go out with them if it was not illegal
I am so nervous that I can't speak English well, even I can't speak Japanese very well
Though I am getting used to standing and teaching in front of them. Still it's embarrasing and I feel nervous
I really want to get to know and make a good relationship with them
However, I feel so isolated that I can't open my heart nor relax myself
I know I should interact with ALTs and improve my English, but I'm so tired that I am not able to communicate smoothly
So I have decided to wake up earlier and do some exercises
It is said that doing some exercise in the morning will make us heathier
①In terms of history, the Democracy has been made(founded?) very recently
At the stage of the age,  among the first words what that children utter, there come words such as 'my' and 'mine'  "
Considering both, I prefer the later one
We spent almost all day practicing because it has been a long time to meet together
We are supposed to play our song in the ceremony, which will be fun for us and the guests
After the practice,we went to a Karaoke
I'm not good at singing, so but I wanna be good
It would be great if anyone who sees this diary correct my mistakes
I don't know whether i want to be a teacher or not in a true sense. (It sounds more natural
What's even worse is the fact that I am getting old. (\"even\" emphasizes how worse it is
I am a bit too old age to change my career. (\"Jobs\" are short-term things. \"Careers\" are long-term professions that you go to college for, such as being a lawyer or doctor
Of course, there is the current recession in Japan, which complicates things
Right now, I am working as a tutor at a high school prep and so on
But the job is just only temporary one. So, it's unstable, you know. (Try not to start sentences with \"and\" \"but\" or \"or
I need to get a proper job that will be enough to make a living off of
So, once in a while, I get miserably depressed. (Kanashii wa
Since yesterday, I have been down
But I have realized that life goes on no matter how depressed you get or how worried you are about your future
No matter how many times you worry, sometimes you can achieve at what you want to and sometimes you cannot
Still, life goes on
So all I have to do now is just to do what I can do for now. (Sounds more natural
That's the essential key to facing my problem
It's not so positive, but my problem is a challenging on. Isn't it
Do you have any diseases
According to an announcement from the Ministry of Labor and Health, about 30 percent out of 120 million Japanese have some health issues such as high pressure, backache(腰痛？), sore shoulder, disorder of the eyes and so on because of aging, stress and overworking
Long Time No See
It's been a long time since I last wrote my diary. 
I think I use the same phrase all the time whenever I start my diary. 
Well, I will talk about recent happenings in my life. 
I've just begun teaching in high school
I am having fun in school
Students are so nice and obedient, which is very good for me since I am a beginner
But things aren`t always good. 
First, students are very very good at English because this school is well known for its high-standard English education
So it's hard for me to teach them as some of them are even better than I am
There are some students who grew up abroad
In terms of speaking, I feel inferior to them
Today, the cold deteriorates my cold is worse because I helped the my senior till late time yesterday
I helped to edit the video what celebrates the edit a video celebrating my senior's friends getting marry.wedding
So my condition is broken at bad since noon when I went to work
I were was sleeping till I want back home this afternoon
Now that I eat some have eaten some light diner, and I will go to bed to be quiet. (not sure what this part means, do you mean you're going to sleep so you can feel better more quickly
Trying too hard is too bad. too hard itself
Now JAPAN falls into serious crisis 
I have no problems because I live in Nara
But my grandfather lives in Fukushima

failures into seeds of success and bring happiness (in)to your life
hardships of life leave you feeling depressed, you can feel much better you can improve your life by 
Then, your discouraging experiences can become an essential step towards the 
So, I am always trying to keep staying stay positive 
Now, I am an optimistic person, but I used to be easily depressed by (my) failures
However, I changed the my way of thinking after listening to a speech, which is was given by Steve Jobs, who is a founder and a CEO of Apple Computers
It is was really impressive and gives gave me the courage to keep (\"continue\" sounds a little better in this case because it's more proper\/formal
making an  efforts even if I face plights encounter challenges. (I think \"face plights\" makes sense but nobody says this
and hardships, but he taught me how to handle difficulties
He established Apple Computers when he was young, and enjoyed began to enjoy
But \/Then suddenly
Jobs (Perhaps \"work\"?) became extremely distressed stressful and he lost the will to do anything
He was determined to start again and so he 
struggled to survive because he liked his job very much
Then he 
launched a new company named \"Next\", and another company named 
Pixar afterward. such a discouraging event
The company he sold has become the foundation and been playing an important role in Apple. an important foundation for Apple
He addressed stated that if he had not been fired, Apple would not have become one of the most successful companies in the world
His story demonstrates that difficulties at the time can be an 
essential link to greater happiness and 
positive thinking paves the way 
for making greater success
Looking back in the past, he realized that his 
failures were not so bad and that they are were a necessary step towards his 
future current success
There is no need not to be depressed because after all, the 
sun always rises again
So, don't you think that it is ridiculous to get become (\"become\" has a more formal nuance so is better in a speech\") discouraged every time a difficulty may occur
Second, do not speak use depressing words
If you keep showing being optimistic, your optimism will grows
Why don’t you take actions
success and I make me happier in my the future
But if I am pessimistic, I cannot make full use of my experiences
So I want to look forward 
and stay positive in at any times

What's the best way to study writing and speaking
I am a sophomore now
So, I would like to know about the system of undergraduate international students in your school
1, When I look at the application form for international students, there does not appear to be a 
regulation of the TOEFL score
Does this mean that do not evaluate TOEFL scores and that you only evaluate SAT scores? (don't is correct but in a formal writing like this do not is better
You only admit the score of SAT

Secondly,we need reflesh times. (I don't understand what you mean by reflesh) maybe you could try this --> 1) Another reason is, sports take away stress. 2) secondly, we need to relax

I ask the waiter and have only half of the normal amount of rice at restaurants, and a small portion of rice at dinner. (\"half of the rice at the restaurant\" is pretty understandable, but could be interpreted as \"(half of) (the rice at the restaurant)\", which is a lot of rice!)"
The website (what website? It sounds odd to say 'the website' with nothing introducing it) defines \"paternalism\" as the following: sentences
Moreover, according to “Guide to Cross Cultural Communication” which is written by Sana Reynolds and Deborah Valentine, there are two characteristics in “paternalism”.paternalism has two characteristics.What you wrote isn't wrong, but this way sounds more natural to me. Also, you don't need to put paternalism in quotes every time
First, people who have are more powerful control less powerful people. or, \"people who have more power control people with less power
Second, people who have the right to control less powerful people must take care of them. I'm just guessing that this is what you wanted to say, because \"take of them\" doesn't make sense
I have defined “paternalism” up to now. This is essentially what \"paternalism\" is. Saying that you have defined it after such a short time when you said you would define it at the beginning sounds repetitive. You could also say, if you wanted to sound a bit more official, \"This is essentially what constitutes 'paternalism'\". 
Henceforth, I would like to write about a social issue in Japanese society in which I think “paternalism” is can be observed. If you say \"is observed\" it makes it sound like everyone is studying it very intently, as though they are worried about it, which I don't think is what you intended. 
I think “paternalism” is can still be observed in medicine. I'm a little confused as to why you have \"still\" here, as it implies that paternalism is dying out. Since there is no mention of this, it sounds a bit odd? If that's what you intended, then it's fine
This is because the doctor has confidence in my his ability. Since this is a general statement, it sounds very strange to use \"my\".Whose ability are we talking about? The doctor's? 
Certainly, the doctor’s decision is sometimes right, but there are a few chances to misunderstand the condition of the patient. ways in which the patient's condition can be misunderstood. \"chances\" makes it sound like the doctor is trying to misunderstand. I can't think of a better word in place of \"chance\", so if I were to say this I'd put it into the passive as such

The event I went to yesterday with my girlfriend was called \"Tokyo bay Dai Hanabi Taikai\" and was the biggest fireworks event in Tokyo

I love Scandinavian furnitures
In These days, I am into Scandinavian furnitures
I love that they are sophisticated, cute and simply designed and that they do not get old quickly. I can also feel the warmth of the wood from them
Many antique Scandinavian pieces of furnitures are made by with rosewood, mahogany or teak wood, so they have different auras toward contemporary wooden furnitures
The colors of the woods is intermediate between oak and walnut, which are popular woods in contemporary furnitures
And Recently rosewood and teak are hard to find, so there are many funs for antique furnitures.(I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say by 'many funs

An English Wordbook in Japan
This book introduces slang words and lines that are used in the movie \"Full Metal Jacket
Any other. Another is
I think these books are for Otaku and are not suited for leaning languages
Just funny
By the way
are there such books like that in other countries
And do you want to read such wordbooks for learning other languages?"
Today is a beautiful and sunny day and Saturday
I usually spend my weekends to go going shopping or doing exercises or just relaxing
I always think that to keep keeping an English diary in English is a good way to practice my English skills
But, unfortunately, I somehow didn't do it.quit in a way to do it
Therefore, I chose to join in this Lang-8
But my English was did not improve.First, one thing that I felt was that I am not afraid of  English anymore even thought I could not (could not what?) what people said
In other words, I do not care about the surrouding people around me
I don't know if it is good or bad
I have still been am still eagerly wishing that I wish I could use English like a as native
Second, I am going to go shopping
I hope I will have a good weekend, and so will also all of you have that too !"

As foreign people also may know, there are a lot of situations to use the Microsoft Power Point in presentations
The revolutionary software has been very useful to display information effectively and provocatively to the audience
I also often use the application conveniently, although, I have a big problem with using the software when translating Japanese material into English one
I often translate Power Point documents in Japanese to English
Mistakes in a translation aren't much of a problems because  it's checked by a senior of mine at the end of the translation
Kanji shows a lot of meaning by itself
Speaking of an example which I encountered today, I dealt with \"法令対応範囲.\" (6 words) It means \"scope for the enforcement by Japanese law.\" But if I try to enter the phrase in small box on a sheet of a Power Point document, the phrase can be entered with only small fonts which wouldn't be seen by remote audience when having a presentation
So how to fit a small space bothers me every time I translate Japanese into English
But my boss won't (let me) do so..."
I've been very busy and tired for this one week because I have several tasks that are supposed to be submitted to my boss in several days in order to promote our project
I'm very sad because I am only expecting to see only my daughter's good sleeping face today too
As you may know, the Japanese calender hasa \"Golden week,\" which is a combination of national holidays in early May
But I don't like this system where the government places many national holidays at the same time and makes consecutive holidays
Since everybody gets off at the same time, almost all of places where people go--such as amusement parks, zoos, theaters, and the roads people will get there on-- will be hardly (または \"heavily\" ? ) crowded
Although the Japanese labor system has the same system of \"holidays with pay\" applied to many foreign countries which everyone can take at will, willing Japanese workers don't get that supposedly because the Japanese are assiduous and don't want to act alone, such as getting a holiday with pay while other co-workers work
I think this is so inefficient that we should decrease national holidays and make getting a certain number of holidays with pay obligatory
It's the center of the Golden week right now, but despite that, I'm working at my office as usual!"
This is the first diary I've written on this site
I don't understand Lang-8 very well
I stayed in London, UK last year for two months in order to study English
I have only a few opportunities to communicate with foreign people in English, so I think I must find or make opportunities to communicate with anyone who can use English
Oh, it's so late, I've gotten really sleepy!"
Are there lots of patients that have allergies to pollen in your country
I've often heard allergy to pollen, especially to Japanese ceder, has become a national disease of Japanese people nowadays
On this season, by the beginning of spring, pollens of Japanese ceder is starts to fly to almost everywhere in Japan
The major symptoms are a runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes
These are very rough symptoms
I've also have allergy to pollen since 10 years ago. 少し変
Firstly I thought I had caught cold on that day, but after weeks from the finding, I realized it had been a allergy to pollen because there aren't such protracted colds
Recently I use antiallergic drugs such as a histamine-antagonizing agent, drops and a nasal drip of steroids
The symptoms can be almost controlled by them
According to today's weather forecast, it is a fine day tomorrow
Usually I can think the fine day is very good and comfortable, but only in this season I might be able to think so. 少し変
Because pollens are flying everwhere and sometimes the symptoms are appearing by enormous pollens in the air
I have had very hard work within the last month and this situation is continuing in a month
As you may know, generality of companies originated in Japan close their financial period at the end of May, which is applied in my company too.  \"may\" sounds better
So just these days are the center of the busy term for finance-related personnel -I'm also the one of those people- in a lot of Japanese companies
But for this season we can see beautiful full-blown cherry blossoms throughout along my way to my company
Cherry Blossoms in Japan
I don't think there could be a single Japanese person who dislikes cherry blossoms
As you can see in the pictures above, in this season we have picnic parties under the cherry trees while watching the blossoms opening up on the trees or flying down from the trees
We call these parties \"花見 hanami.\" 
One week ago, I also went to a park with my wife and daughter to that was 30 minutes by car from my home
I was very happy to see just starting the blossoms just starting to fall off from the branches, as if the cherry blossoms are April showers
Especially Japanese people are especially fascinated by falling cherry blossoms
Medieval Japanese fighter 'Bushi' would have hoped to die with dignity and beauty in battle, like falling cherry blossoms. during battles
Of course, we don't take it to that extreme, but I think the love for the 'cherry blossom' is  a precious culture that's passed down through the generations in Japanese
Do you know what the captioned phrase means
As it may be known only in Japan, I will tell you. It's a national campaign against increasing CO2 emission levels
If you want to know more information about it, please read the following site
thorough the recycling of wastes generated during our business operation
Although I think I'm proud of our company's actions and also individually try to do them voluntarily, recently our office has been so hot that I can't get out of my paper fan, which is called \"団扇\" in Japanese and harness only my own power, due to a energy cut for artificial cooling systems
Sometimes the hotness make me think that we reduce our working efficiency by 6% while we reduce of CO2 emission by 6%!"
I'm writing a notification which informs managers of our subsidiary companies of a  the schedule for submission  submitting of some documents to our office
Firstly  To begin with, I wrote a Japanese version and now I'm trying to translate it  into English
But I think it's difficult due to an  the ambiguity of Japanese
As you may know, English word order is very strict and subjects in English play very important rolls roles, which are not usually omitted, I think. Rolls means something different. They are normally something you would eat 
I was often said  told by my co-worker who is good at writting English that foreign people wouldn't be able to understand my text when I asked him of scanning to scan  through it  after translating it from Japanese to English. Some punctuation would help make this sentence easier to read and understand."
Amazingly, sometimes children derive  different meanings from phrases which are spoken by adults people or on TV programs
My daughter watched a TV program every week day morning which is a animated program(or anime) about vegetable dolls. 
One day pretending to be the narrator I said \"Have a good night!\" apon seening the program
After that, my daughter abruptly said \"おかたづけ!\" As you may know, the word in Japanese means tidy up
I didn't know why she spoke so suddenly
But a few days later I had understood the reason
She understood the meaning of \"Have a good night\" to be \"Have a nainai (ないない
ないない\" is one of baby words, means to tidy up
She mistook \"good night\" to \"nainai.\" Nowadays every time just before she must tidy she says the phrase
My Wife's friends, who are all women,  came to my home from Nagoya to see my wife and daughter today
My wife and them are all nurses and worked in the same hospital up until 3 years ago, when we moved to Osaka from Nagoya due to my company transfer
They were surprised by how much my daughter had grown because it is the first time they would have met my daughter for the first time in 2 years
My wife and I cooked some Japanese dishes, fried oyster, fried shrimp, boiled chicken with soy source, pork soup with various root vegetables and salad
They talked about things, such as the  medical policies the Japanese government implemented, what their current hospital's working conditions are like and their own lives
As you may have realized, I couldn't tune out their voices, I stayed in another room in order to do my work
One of my hobbies is taking photos - especially of my daughter. (you don't need the comma
I like to take photos because a photo can have the time and the landscape nailed into the  picture as if the flash freezesthe field of view through the camera's view-finder
Sometimes I could capture a special scene onto a photo, such as really pretty behaviors or flash mild aspect of my daughter
I've tried taking photos to keep the special moments into still pictures because I'll show them to my daughter in the future
But nowadays I have one  problem with taking photos
I take photos in RAW format
As the term \"RAW\" says, it's raw data of a camera's photosensitive element without compressing of its size
Thus the file size of  the photos is very large, about 15MB a photo
I didn't go to the Universal Studio Japan as I wrote about going with my pretty daughter 2 days ago
Finally, I went to shopping with her and my wife
Tomorrow is a national holiday called National Foundation Day of Japan
I'm also off tomorrow. (or \"I have the day off tomorrow

To be honest, I want to go for a master's degree in psychology, about which I have dreamed about at high school
But I decided to do a course in English with for some reason at uni, and I've been making a progress
In my opinion, it's natural for us to make mistakes in making choices, and it's never too late to let us go to the right way. I would say something like \"... it's never too late to change course\" or something
But it seems they (who?) don't really like this idea, because they believe I should make use of my English skill to make living(?) as long as I've studied abroad
But I also believe my experience in England is valuable not only for my job, but also for my life
I know that I should go my way,but I just don't want to make them disappointed or sad by my choice

I want to comment that Last Sunday, I watched a film called The King's Speech. I recommend it; it's a very good movie, not only because of the story, but also because it has good actors and a good soundtrack

At the same time, babies are gifted with an innate humor which enables them to laugh a lot in the future
It is natural that there are crests and troughs in our lives
Therefore, as human beings, we may be weighed down by the stress if we couldn't find a suitable way to relieve them
Some of them shout loudly or scream, some of them take a vacation, and most of the women go shopping and maximize their credit cards
There are various activities that could relieve stress, but we should only consider the ways that are harmless to ourselves and the others
On the other hand, if we make good use of our sense of humor, we are not only can reduce pressure but can also bring plenty of happiness to ourselves and the people around us
I got seriously homesick this week, and I hate this feeling
I am a patient listener but now I want to find one to share my feelings.  It would sound more common to say 'someone' instead of 'one

We used to fight, arguing and stole each other's chocolate and candies.  That would be 'stealing' 
I enjoy that kind of life with them. (note: this could be called \"sibling rivalry

I am very sad, staying alone in my room without my brother or sisters
Hopefully I will survive in the next few months and I can play with them again when I go back to home.  the word 'to' isn't necessary

I have been in Canada for five months now
I miss my family, my friends, my six dogs and the delicious food in(from) my home town
Studying in Canada is a valuable chance for me to become mature and learn to overcome tons of difficulties and barriers
This is my first time to seeing snow and I'm overjoyed
Canadians are friendly and nice
They always put on smiles on their faces
Last time when my friend and me were leaving the Superstore and decided to walk back to the drom, a Canadian couple drove us back
We are extremely appreciate what they did since we were cold and not used to the weather
today is bad weather
i went to around the city for shopping on boxing day
i've bought a bag, some cosmetics, and some clothes etc
Of the few birthday gifts I have received they were rather typical gifts
Maybe, the people who gave them did so with no particular special meaning in those presents
However, I think whether a present is special or not depends on your own mind rather than the other person's intent
In contrast to other gifts, it was the most simple and cheapest one, but it was also my favorite one
It was different from those pencil boxes you can see in the bookstore, it was not made of textile but plastic
Compared to those with a colorful and delicate design it is a simple white-black matching color and square shape
My friends usually praise my box for its cute pattern which is different from those monotonous logos on other pencil boxes
What a delight for me is that everybody likes the pencil box so mush and wants to buy a similar one for themselves
Nevertheless, the reason why I like the present so much is not the pattern, the color or the shape, but the memory of the friend who gave the gift
What touched me deeply was that my classmate carved some words with best wishes in the pencil box for me
Come on, come on
Athough English is very difficult for me
But, I will succeed must success if I try my best...."

The United States may requests Japan to increase of Japanese its share of costs for U.S. military bases
Kan Naoto, who is a the Japanese Prime Minister, is going to visit the U.S. and discuss this issue with President Obama president
The U.S. probably thinks the cost is greater expenditures are needed for to ensure Japanese peace between Japan and China
But Japan will request to decrease its share of the cost, because the gathering had thought that the cost is was too higher already
The discussion is not likely to go smoothly
The issue concerning US bases is one of the most interesting news topics in Japan. [Perhaps you mean that this issue is one of the \"most debated topics\"-- that is, a topic many people argue about
I suppose Japan is trying to change its relationships with the US and China. [The reason \"US\" needs to be preceded by \"the\" is that it stands for the noun phrase \"united states
Asian economies are going to expand in the next ten years. [\"Economics\" usually means 経済学; what you mean here is economy\/economies
What is a important for us? [Alternative: What is most important for us? Note: \"important\" is an adjective; \"a\" can only precede a noun or noun phrase.]"
Relationship Between China and Japan
In September 19, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that China has ceased political relations with Japan
It was caused by a Chinese ship's captain being arrested by the Japanese police
The ship struck a Japan Coast Guard's ship in the Senkaku group of islands
I supposed that this is a difficult problem
Japan and China should have a more intimate relationship
I hope it is resolved quickly

Can someone edit \/ correct this
The Russo-Japanese War began \/ started because Japan wanted to halt the spread of the Russian expansion into East Asia. 
This was what Japan feared the most, since they regarded Korea and Manchuria as a buffer
If an agreement was not made soon, war would break out at once, which worried all of Europe since \/ as Russia was allied with France and Germany, and Japan had (already) signed a treaty with Great Britain
Europe was concerned that the war would spread across the world
It’s not that anyone sought war in either country (Russia and Japan), but no matter what happened, it’s as if the war was supposed to happen. \/ ...but despite everything, war was inevitable. 
However, we only arrived to these circumstances due to outdated governmental policies by almost half a century
The following will explain in detail the events of the Russo-Japanese war and how Japan was conceived as an “easy” enemy, yet who came to be acknowledged as one of the greatest military powers in the world after the apparent victory during the Battle of the Sea of Japan."

How to improve my English essay writing 
Now, I'm preparing for my one year study in America as an international student
I am trying my best to sharpen all my abilities to make progress in my English learning
However, I encountered a difficulty in my English writing
My teachers said my essays have weak organization
They said my ideas and thoughts of my essays were very confused and messy
To be honest, it really was a big impact on me
I didn't know there was so many problems about my writing skills
What's more, my writing grade of TOEFL also showed my writing ability is weak
I can't use concrete and clear words to support my ideas and word usage isn't idiomatic
Due to above these reasons, I decided to try to improve my English writing, by writing diaries every day
Also, I want to try and write two or three essays and ask my teachers to mark them every week
I'm starting to practice this plan
I hope it could be useful and helpful for me to improve my English writing skill."

When Gerard sing sang a Cancer (not too sure what you are trying to tell...), he came to the centar (center?) of the audience!(°Д°) We were very surprised
It was like we dived into the sea
But the happening occasion\/event excited made us exciting
We enjoyed it
We could listened to the new songs, and we could see saw the fireworks

Please correct my sentences and let's be friends."
Mario Kart Wii
Today I did played Mario Kart Wii with my child.(this is fine, but saying son\/daughter sounds more natural
He is 2years old, so he just had a held the controller
But he felt that playing the game.<--Seems to be missing a word describing emotion after 'felt'. Maybe you meant 'But he felt happy while playing the game
He likes it very much,often invited me.He liked it very much, he even asks me to play with him now. "
In Korea, criminals are on the rise each day. 
A reason for this problem is that an increasing number of young people are becoming criminals. 
If our country doesn't correct laws, it will perish in the near future due to student's criminal behavior

For the benefit of all people, public peace must be keep all day."
today, I have police english test a police test in english. (is the test actually called \"police english test\"? if it is, then it's okay
It is very difficult to slove the problems on the test
I think that english is a very hard in my subject
but, to be a policeman, (policemen is more than one policeman) I have to learn the police english. (connect this sentence with the sentence above
so, i will study english steadily from now on. (OR i will study english often.)"
Maybe it's too late to talk about this year's Valentine's, as the day has already passed
But there are some interesting things that I'd like to take note of
On that day, I gave a phone call to my parents to wish them a Happy Valentine's Day
My mom mentioned that she had not received any gifts from my dad
My Daddy is one of those traditional Chinese men
He loves my mom very much, but rarely, if ever, says \"I love you\" to my mom; at least, he never says it when I'm around
He would rather cook a good dinner than offer useless words and flowers
This is the same for most of Chinese men of the traditional sort
Many of whom are middle-aged
I called dad, said that he could buy a pouch of shrimps and cook them as a gift for mom
In my local dialect, \"shrimp\" and \"flower\" have the same pronunciation, \"Hou
So this Valentine's Day, my mom received \"Hou\" as a gift and she was very happy about it
My dad was also very happy; for the \"shrimps\" not only showed his love for my mom on that  special day, but he wasted no money on unnecessary matters too."
Terrible  Cold
I caught a bad cold last week
At first, my nose was runny and I could not stop sneezing
Then one night, my nose was totally stuffed up and  I could not breath at all
I did not get much sleep because I could not breathe.  
I could not sleep
When I finally fell asleep, I did not sleep well
Now I am dizzy and I cannot hear well.  
When people talk to me, the voices sound like they are coming from 30 miles away.  
It feels like a piece of paper is covering my ear.  
I am so sick right now.  
I hate having a cold.  
My nose is still stuffed up as I type these words.  
I wish I get better soon."
This afternoon, i will take the train to go to Suzhou From Shanghai

They all have its their own charactoristics characteristics

When I get returned back home, I was still thinking of those beautiful and graceful gardens, I even dreamed of them at night
So I decided to visit them again
That must be a very happy tour this time.This time it will be an enjoyable tour."
I am so happy to hear that one of my best friends will be getting married this October
She said all the wedding preparation will be done by her and her fiance
Because in China, most parents will undertake almost all wedding preparations instead of their children do
Now my friend has 8 months to prepare stuffs until October
So they will have a very beautiful wedding photo associate with good landscape
My friend also said that she will go to buy her wedding dress after the May Day Holiday
Because in China, MDH is a big holiday and almost every employee will have a 3-7 paid-holiday, and that means people will have free time to be invited to weddings or other big issues functions. -> 'issues' is used in a grave context when compared to 'functions
So many couples will choose MDH to celebrate their weddings
That will cause the price increasing inflation of  merchandise
And after the MDH, the prices will reduce to the normal standard
I hope she can find her own style
And I wish good luck to my friend."

There are many, many theses
So, I decided to divide the theses list by years

This is my new band, Final Liberty, and I (just) uploaded my our song 'Evil Braze
The song is sung in Japanese, and I did the growling
I love guitar players influenced by Van Halen, this guy is very good at making melody lines
If you watch samurai X that is called rurouni kenshin in Japan, you may have listened to their song called pure feeling that is one third. (I don't know what you mean by \"one third
They made want to make songs like Van Halen first
I like hard rock songs more than heavy metal maybe, but sometimes I want to listen to Manowar and Judas Priest."
This is my first movie that I made, I made the music, and the movie was made by Makoto Shinkai, who made great animation movies in Japan
I think if I make some MAD movies and send them to some game companies,  they would think I can make some music videos

My dream is to make theme songs for  Japanese hentai games
When you think of hentai games, you'll have a negative image  maybe
But these games have great stories and melodious songs
For example, this is the theme song of Air
It has great lyrics and a great melody, don't you think so
If songs I made were listened to by anime fans and game fans, that would be great and this is my goal of my life
I respect the people who made these songs
My purpose in starting Lang-8 is to meet a lot of game fans and anime fans in abroad
I want to make hentai games in the future and make theme songs by myself
But my wish is more stronger than others
I have made this video for youtube and nikoniko movies, check it out!!!! (sounds more natural)"
This Song is Great

In the 80's there are were a lot of great heavy metal bands
When I first heard this song I was in high school, and I was knocked out by Vivian's great guitar solo
I was knocked out by Vivian's greart guitar solo.*I added this to the previous sentence
This song remainds reminds me of my high school days when I didn't have friends and played guitar in my room
I don't have friends, so I played the guitar in my room and thought someday I wanted to join a band and play heavy metal.While playing guitar in my room, I often thought that I would someday want to join a heavy metal band. 
Heavy metal is my life and this song gives me power to _________ .ADD A WORD TO THE END SO IT CAN BE A COMPLETE SENTENCE"
In a village, people can't tell what they think , because they are afraid of being hated by others
Hated people will be ignored by others
Majority decides what is wrong and what is right, different kind of thinking is looked down upon
Since I was born, this village has been uncomfortable for me
Long time to no see
I have made an original song and I want to show you it
This song is from my new band 'Final Liberty' 
Final Liberty is made up of two people, myself, the guitarist and sound editor, and Yoryu, the singer
Presenting Abstract Thoughts in English
In Japan we are forced to be like others from when we are born
In elementary school, we are taught to conform with people in our class
For example, when an athletic meet is held, we are forced to march on like soldiers  in north korean
And if you make a mistake in such a situation, you are scolded by teachers
Not just in school, but also amongst your friends , when we go to 'KARAOKE' you must sing songs your friends know
If you sing metal songs , you are looked upon coldly by your friends
So if you were in Japan , you should make sure to conform with others
I must get up early tomorrow in order to play basketball at my university's gym
I sent an e-mail to my senior to play with me, but he won't come for when we have promised
That's because he's often late for appointments
If he is late tomorrow, I will practice shooting whilst waiting for him
While I was waiting for a customer, I was reading the book that my professor lent me
Compared to my previous job, my job now is easy and interesting
I think that there is nothing as easy a part-time job as mine
Useless][soccer]I just wanted to share this, \"What a big
Fox or Dog
Soccer] Did you see the Uruguay-Costa Rica football\/soccer match
Foreign VIPs came today without their interpreter
It is so relevant to my condition that I typed it twice. (or 'It's so crucial that I have to emphasize this phrase.' 
No doubt they are not very interested in using Japanese, I've already checked that
executive director, always does the his own right thing without considering the troubles that his actions bring. (is this what you mean? or is it 'always does the right thing in times of trouble
I am happy to work here and I will enjoy the rest of their 3-day stay in Japan. (because it seems that they are staying longer and you are only going to enjoy their stay for 3 days after that you're not going to anymore :P)"
Today I worked at a part time job
I had to wake up so early, and it was a long day , so now I am tired
But it was kind of fun
It is a event of TOMIKA and train ?? (Thomas the train
It is about a train toy that is popular in Japan, there are people who like to correct it ^^ (not quite sure what you mean ... 
I would rather go there just to get out (have fun), not really for work hehe"
It has been a long time that I didn't write since I've written a diary, so I wanna write about some things that happened in these days recently \/ in the last few days 
First I could found a job
It is so good because I was looking for a job that in which I could use my Portuguese skills, and this jjob is perfect
To tell the truth, I am not sure that I will could do it perfectly, but I will try hard
Now in Japan it is so hard to find a job, especially for foreigners. I am helping some Brasilian friends but it's hard
I want this bad time finish to end 
I wanna study more to xould   be able to help more people!"
My father did it for my parents because they will back to Brasil
necessity of \"a\" (it is just a minor spelling error. Those often happen due to similaritys in the pronounciation of 'c' and 's' that sometimes occure in english
It's a well-known story in Japan, told when you go to another country: (I had problems guessing your intention in this sentence, so I assumed you wanted to tell, that this story is told to people going to foreign countrys
A man said to the\/a reception clerk, \"Could you please call me docter, I'm feeling sick.\" (You need to add the \"to the\" or \"to a\" here, so it is clear that the clerk is the object. Your version might be misread as the man saying the words \"reception clerk
Yes, docter.\" but even though the man was waiting, a docter didn't come.(the \"however\" here is far, far too unclean english
A man, catching a cold or something, wanted to get a docter for him.(I do not remember comma gramatics very well, as I am allready using english like a mothertounge, but I am pretty sure that these two are superfluous
I often confuse about a, an, the it needs or not.[I recommend the following sentence:I often confuse \"a\" and \"an\" with each other, and do not know when it is needed, or not.orI am often confused about wether the use of \"a\" and \"an\" is nescessary, or not
Wrong articles create misunderstandings
So I must think of them \/ remember to use them."
Similarly, Nyankoi is a good anime, and I expect (instead of \"I expect\", you can use \"I anticipate\", \"I am waiting for\", etc.) the second season
But Kampfer is a bad anime. this It is merely sexual, and last ep the last episode was too very bad
Anyway, I have watched all of that those stories
JDAM_Cid You always nominate me to a follow friday. (This doesn't make sense to me
Haruhi matches songs of girls rock band's girls rock band songs
http:\/\/bit.ly\/7gQ6E8 BTW, Haruhi's new movie isn't playing at my region's theater
So I'm too very sad
Kampfer's ED song was made by the composer who did Harehare-Yukai from Haruhi, I heard
I read Ghost in the Shell on the in a magazine
That The story is the same as the anime Stand Alone Complex 1st season
Radiation Risk Too High
If we seriously think about the radiation risk, I think atomic power plants should only be constructed at very far from the city. In Japan there are only a few locations that could be used for that kind of area."
Now, I'm so sleepy, because I went to bed at 2AM last night. (2PM = two hours after noon, 2AM = two hours after midnight
Yesterday, I tried an Online English free-trial lesson
But my tutor's line had something wrong with it... so I couldn't talk much
At least I could get a feel for what the lessons are like, I decided to continue lessons
That is I speak too fast
Maybe it's because I got excited and tried to express myself too eagerly
Some seemed a little confused by my English
At that time, I spoke fast, too
I think I should have been more relaxed and should have spoken slower
I will be careful with this weakness."
From Starting April, It starts the will be my second year as a of member of society

Did you ever think how much you could save money if you have unique knowledge about the airlines which do not have other people do not have 
Now, airlines, to ensure that as much as possible for us to make and it only depends on us whether we will use this service deliberately. [Your meaning is unclear
Quite by chance, I came across on the Internet (on humans), an airline employee who knows how to simply pay less 
It was a great surprise to me that such knowledge existed
I decided to check it out and bought his guides
I must tell you that I'm still in shock. Airlines are doing great business in the giving great discounts to the ordinary passengers, but not to me
This guide is a real knowledge cost saver and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money on their flights."

I really want to draw while looking my garden but it was cold
When I showed that picture to my grandmother, then she said \" can you draw a picture of a cow for me, I'd like to use one for a letter.\" 
Do you understand why she said that things
Because they [we?] have a custom to send a letter on January 1st
We generally write \"Happy New Year\"and a picture of the twelve signs of the Chinesed zodiac in letters
The picture which I drew is too big so she maybe will scan it with the computer

i am writing a diary entry for the first time
yesterday i went to an amusement park with my sister
it takes thirty minutes to get there with using freeway
if  i get through the entrance by nine in the morning,it is very cheaply
i left home at eight thirty for  that to do but i had to pay twice the amount of money because we made a  mistake in choosing the correct freeway exit of freeway
seeing as we arrived at the amusement park without getting into an accident
first we enjoyed riding attraction that are selected by Guinness book of world records
it is the most  highest and fastest in the world
we made posed for the camera to come out  on the way
we had good smiles in the photo
so we wanted to buy the photo but another person was saying
they're face didn't look good
we abandoned buying photo and we promised to buy a photo someday
after that we took a bath in the spa
for example hot bath, tepid water
and the scenes were different
i relaxed looking at a river, waterfall, and bamboo
recently  Japanese garden instead of increase west garden. (I'm not sure what you're trying to say here... Maybe \"Recently, Japanese gardens are increasing in popularity.\" But...I'm not sure if this is what you meant

The first one is the admission
Students who go this route who want to use this way have to take the GSAT(General Scholastic Ability Test) during in each winter vacation
If it goes smoothly, you can enter college earlier and have 2~3 more months of summer vacation
The second approach one is to take the DRT(Department Required Test) in each during the beginning of summer vacation
Moreover, the DRT always puts focus on the most difficult parts of the courses, so most of the students would rather give up courses of 3rd grade than take the DRT
They only have to fill in the departments they want to enter in on the form on the website of UAC on the UAC website's form, and wait for the result according to their grades
In other words, the grades determine the outcome make the decision
I think that the first way is better because it make schools and parents help students to find their target in of life earlier
High school students in Taiwan must arrive at school by at 7:30 every day, and stay in school for 9 hours until 17:00
The admission will improve students' motivation to of learning learn, and it may convince parents to give their children more free time
I really feel some pressure
Recently, I am always thinking of the years when i was young，which was happy，relaxing, and there was no pressure
I'm looking forward to the future

There are two sides to life
One is happiness, and the other is sadness
Whenever I receive a client's disgruntled e-mail, I feel it is a bad day
There are many ways I can make myself feel better
First of all, I analyze the reasons to find the source of the trouble
Then, I discuss how to solve the problem with my team members
I know that worrying and being sad will ruin my ability to think clearly, so I try to avoid negative emotions
Secondly, if I can not solve the problem by myself, I will ask my supervisor to help me
My supervisor's advice has the best solution for me. It's always valid
Thirdly, I can think in a positive way, because I know that everything always has a root cause
I can handle the problem by discovering and dealing with all these root causes
In my opinion, I think sharing our problems with everyone whom we trust and not giving up is the best solution for all problems."

She asked me to allow her to visit her friend's hometown

My father always expects me to take care of her, I cannot reject this mission
Unfortunately we meet everyday
I know how sad she is, but I have to do this

10th entry: \"In your opinion, why do people raise money for charity? Have you ever done anything to raise money for charity
There are plenty of reasons for raising money for charity
The most important reason is sharing with the Poor
As you know, Our society is developing rapidly, thus the living cost is also increasing quickly
As a result, it is difficult for poor people to survive
People are ready to give a hand to the poor who really needs our helps
Some people have a strong beliefs that, if we help someone right now, we will get more in the future
This belief has been proven for many years
It is the truth, when we give to charity to help the poor, we feel happy ourselves
I also do charity whenever I have the chance
Actually we have a charity fund in our company, each staff will become a member for contributing to this fund. ( Do you mean each staff will become a member of the company after contributing to this fund or each of them must be a member of this charity fund
We always help the poor, especially children who have no chance to study
We help them by providing all the necessary things like cloths, food, and books as well
In my opinion, doing charity is not always by giving money to the poor
As students we can do things such as like spending time with the poor, working at charity organization
This is the fair life.( This doesn't make sense. Sounds weird. Can you tell me what you were trying to say?) --> This is the fairness in life

Some students may forget to bring their pencil(s
Some students may not know their test room and get lost. Since you are using the plural (\"Some students\"), you cannot use \"his\" or \"her\" in the rest of the sentence, since they are not plural. 
The built-in speaker in the test room may suddenly break

I am a bit confused because the title of this entry is \"Happy Holiday\", so I thought that perhaps you meant that you went to a cafe during during your holiday - the correct sentence to use would then be \"On the weekend, we also went to a cafe during the morning

It's a kind of cookie which is very interesting
You will get a message which predicts your day once you split the cookies. < 'after' is correct, but in this sentence, 'once' has the meaning 'immediately when
People buy it just for fun
And there was a message like this : \"It will be a luck day.\" I didn't care about it since I bought it just for fun
But today is really a happy day. < you don't believe the prediction, but it really came true
I can't tell you about that exactly, but it is a very lucky day for me
And I think it is a good idea to buy this cookies, even though it's just for fun
I will buy more of it later

Since using this site, I have more opportunities to read other people's essays
I have studied English by myself before I knew the site, so I didn't have a chance to read them
Now, I can read a lot of essays written by English learners
Actually, I am surprised by their writing
They don't make mistakes in their sentences and they use very nice words
Their expressions are also good
Thinking about it more and more makes me lose my confidence
I was in a slump for the last few weeks
And now, I'm going to start again
It may be swollen
These days, I reciteEnglish articles loudly right after I wake up
Now, I'm drinking a lot of water, but it has no effect
I hate having injections."
I had some trouble with a college
But I didn't do anything wrong
So I cleaned my office instead of working during the morning. the placement of this sounds weird to me. I think you can say :So in the morning, instead of working, I cleaned my office instead
I always clean up my room when I'm upset. you can also say: I always clean my room, instead of clean up
I can forget the bad feeling while i am cleaning my room
It's been a long time since I visited this site
because i had a lot of things to do
I decided to study english this year and I finally thought of Lang-8
So, I came back
I hope you will be my English teacher or friend
Add me to your friend list
I'll be waiting for your request."
However, I was worried that I couldn't make friends once I joined this site
I hesitated for a few days to join this site for a few days
Finally, I joined but it was sad at the beginning because nobody corrected my diaries
Because nobody corrected my diarys
So I thought that it was a waste of my time
Then, I tried tostopped using this site
Yet when I entered the site again, I found that someone had corrected my First diary. (you can use 'logged on' to replace 'entered
Thus, I decided to use this site more often
After that, I began to make more friends
Now, I have made many friends and I exchange a lot of emails with them
And I interchange a lot of emails with them
It really helps me to study English and makes me study more harder than before

Presentation on this thursday
This semester I am going to do T. A. work
works
So I have to make a presentation in front of almost 400 freshmen this Thursday
Most of them are good at English because they lived in English speaking nations. (\"Countries\" is better than \"nations\" here, both are correct though
The following is my script to talk
Recently
smartphones like the iPhone and social network services like Facebook and Twitter have become very popular
But don’t you think that this is a just the beginning of something 
So our objective is to design the next generation of social network services or social network supporting tools that can be run on smartphones or handheld devices, and that also uses mobile sensors actively
The most important thing is to be a creative
During the project, you may have to deal with issues like privacy, security and usability
These are examples of current services, but we are expecting your more brilliant ideas
Then you may beat the Mark Zuckerberg, who created Facebook in his dorm room while only 23 years old, and is now the youngest billionaire in the world
I thought that I'd like to start writing in English so that I can become good at English like native speakers
So I searched on the Internet for a paid English writing correction service and fortunately I found this site, lang-8
At first, I doubted wheather whether it is a weired weird site or not but now I am satisfied with this service after using it a couple of times
The mutually beneficial concept that of \"I scratch your back, you scratch mine\" is not only attractive but it works well in reality. 
It is not because of money or a to get certain rewards,. It is the good mind that motivates people to do something and it makes a community
And the community gives help to all the individual members in the community in turn
What an attractive situation it is
Altought this site is somewhat slow and it has a inconvenient interface in a way, I hope this site will be thriving
I hope this site becomes a splendid space that where I can make many friends to talk and know each other, and also learn Eenglish
Thanks for to all friends who read this.or: Thanks to all friends for reading this
How silly I am.was
This evening, a professor suggested to me that we eat dinner together
Although I had full of stomach because of a late lunch, I followed him
We went to one of the finest hotel buffets in the city
I think he was satisfied with the fact that I registered for a doctoral degree course
It will be the first time that he has a PhD
student in our lab's history
Frankly, I am not sure that I can be a great researcher, or that I can even get a PhD degree
I will do try my best."

So I hoped that I could be as lucky as she was
I got up so early this morning that I would not miss this opportuninty. Spelling error
At first,the sunshine was not very bright because there were some clouds and mist around it
But when it was about 8:14,the moon was started to cover the sun
It also meant the begining of a partial eclipse
And then the sun appeared gradually and it was wholly showing it's face about 10:45
At this moment of his emergence,I saw clearly that from the darkness there suddenly appeared a bright ray of light which was shining like a diamond---so great and so beautiful
Likewise,my elder sister took some exciting photoes about the wonders today,although they are not very clear due to the annoying clouds
So,I'm also very glad to show them for all of you

These countries are being watched by many advanced nations with interest
I want to be an civil engineer and help the development of these countries. (a possessive on the plural word of \"countries\" seems a little weird to me

Does it mean something “evil”? It is likely one of the biggest challenges of modern human history, one of the toughest problems humankind ever faced since it’s on a global scale, its sheer enormity and complexity. (questions, even rhetorical, should end in a question mark
And That the Earth’s is getting hotter and hotter means that the more and more solar energy is accumulating inside the Earth’s atmosphere
I see, the most difficult is that they’re not concentrated enough, the energy is distributed throughout a certain area so it’s not as easy to as collect as a piece of coal or nuclear material and burn it up
Why do they have to resolve the question about distributed energy by the size of the “power plants\" (e.g. huge wind turbines
g
huge wind turbines… I wonder why it’s so hard to get those such kinds of energy
A typical question answer I often find out there is is that there is no money
Yes, indeed, It seems the only nation with the only guy appear to be enough of money and capability is the US
And more its government can spend hundreds of billions of dollars to wage a war on some unlucky guys in the deserts of the Middle East ( another glorious victory that hardly any other nation thinks they dare to do – overthrow a government with it military power ranks 4th in just a few weeks ), but yet it feels reluctant to spend more money on serious scientific and technical projects that have the possibility to change the world

International Friendship Football Game サッカーの国際親善試合（英語でタイトルをCapitalizeするのは普通です）
The Japan versus Korea International Friendship Football game of Japan vs Korea was held at in Seoul yesterday
At During the first half, the Japanese attacked aggressively with short passes, but the Korean players defended themselves with their tough amazing physical ability
In contrast with the first half, the Korean players possessed had the ball most of all time at during the latter half and there were the conclusive situations to goal at times they got close to making goals, but the Japanese defender goalee prevented them from doing so at the end. kept no goal at the end
Though it was a friendship match, both of teams did very excited made it a very suspenseful game
Since the next world cup will held at in Brazil in 2014, I hope both of teams improve their technique and tactics. till then and Hopefully they can get a game make it beyond the final 16, which was result of this year's world cup game
The Typhoon No.14 is coming
Now the typhoon No.14 is coming to Sendai.Sendai's 14th typhoon is coming. (Sounds more natural
Therefore the Chilling rain have been falling following yesterday.The chilling rain has been falling since yesterday. 
Since my room, of which I rent costs is inexpensive, it is cold. Right now, I am now in a warm lab apart about from a 5 minutes walk from my room
I don't like cold rain because I am likely to get a cough easily. (You want to use the word \"cold\" here. When English speakers say cold, usually it means we have a cough and feel sick
Super saiyajin Goku, owned by my neighbor, is looking out at the dark outside. Anxious about coughing
As my for today's challenge, I used a relative pronoun, but it's I'm uncertain how to use it
I was surprised to know that she is it was Momoe Yamaguchi
I know her name but I had thought she was just late 70's old idol and sang popular songs during on that time
Her songs are not even old now, and they sounds are like really rock 'n roll
During a my search about her, the fact that she finished her career when she was only 22 astounded me again
I like her music, as one of the I considered it good rock music
Yesterday, the AFC (Asian Football Confederation) championship semi final match between Japan and South Korea was held in Qatar
But they did this time. \/\/ When changing the time frame from \"the past 6 years\" to \"now\/ this time\", it should be explicitly stated
During the game, Japan ran well and South Korea showed tough physicality and good ability
I didn't know the members of South Korea well, but after kick-off, I was surprised that they are very tall and young
They played very gentle, I want to clap and cheer for them. \/\/ With just 'cheer' you don't need 'for', but since you have 'clap' here too and 'clap' requires 'for', it must be added
However there was only one disappointing thing
I thought referee called fouls more easily than usual
If there were fewer calls, we could watch a more exciting dynamic match
Anyway I'm crossing my fingers that both teams can win their next games."
The day before yesterday, we lab members held an Imoni party
An Imoni party is a kind of the BBQ made by filling a pot with aroid, Chinese cabbage, green onion, carrot, meat, and so on and is mainly made in Tohoku region which is located in northern part of Japan
In autumn, the smoke from Imoni parties can be seen near every river in Tohoku
In my hometown, Sendai, the pot is dressed with miso and pork is used
The taste is like tonjiru which is a type of gorgeous miso soup with full of vegetables
In the neighboring prefecture, Yamagata, they use the soy sauce as the main dressing material and use beef
The sweet and salty taste evokes Sukiyaki
Since next year I am going to go to the Kanto region, this time Imoni party might be the last one for me
It was very enjoyable but that idea made me a little bit concerned
The picture was shot a few years ago
At the beginning of May, I went to the western part of Japan for sightseeing
She's been ill lately, so I went there to cheer her up
I hope she will get well soon
Kurashiki is one of the most favorite places I've ever visited because there is a beautiful place named Bikan area
The scenery made me feel relax and nostalgic
I'm a Japanese and a graduate student with two master's degrees
Now, I want to learn foreign languages, especially English now
Because I want to understand or just know about foreign culture ! It's important to explain why, but since this sentence is good explanation, you don't have to SAY the word \"because\". It's understood
Thinking about foreign cultures is thrilling
Since English is spoken all over the world, if I can use English, I can communicate with billions of people and learn about many countries
I am going to write mainly about Japanese university life mainly."
In Japan, there is tons of news about recent difficulties for university students hunting for jobs. [\"News\" is uncountable, so uses the singular verb, like: \"there is tons of sugar in the cupboard
Unfortunately, the rate of students who could get work till October in this fiscal year went down to 58% from 63% of last year. Unfortunately, the rate of students able to find work up to October went down from 68% last year to only 58% this fiscal year
And there is a lot of controversy about what is the main problem. [The controversy is about the one subject matter. We would tend to use \"controversies\" (plural) if there were many controversies about many different matters
There is a lot of work, especially in middle and small companies. [\"Work\" is uncountable - like \"news\" and \"sugar\" above! :) 
They only apply to big famous companies
If students learned their limitations well, they could get work.\" If students understood their limitations well\/better... [I think if you wanted to use \"learned\", then \"if students had learned...\" would make more sense to me
Others insist, \"There are too many more students than ever before
The number of university students has been increasing, it's double compared to 1990. [Students is a countable noun. \"The number of...\" for countable nouns, \"the amount of...\" for uncountable nouns. E.g. \"the amount of sugar\", \"the amount of news
Now, the undergraduate degree is less special than it used to be
Most of the\/these opinions are hard on students
So, the students who are exhausted or getting angry about job hunting held a demonstration \/ started to demonstrate \/ demonstrated. 
University doesn't provide good\/any preparation facility for job hunting
Japan is in a depression right now
Lately, my eyes have been getting tired because I've spent so\/too much time sitting in front of a\/my computer display
I usually carry out\/do experiments in the lab and analyze the data by computer
When I felt being exhausted, watching the news of the world was my favorite way to rest
It was good for my feeling but not for my eyes(xx) [\"good for my feeling\" sounds a little strange... It was good for my exhaustion, but not for my eyes. ? The problem is \"feeling\" has special meanings
So I bought a Rubik's cube
At first, I couldn't do well, though I read\/looked at the operating manual
But after doing it more than 5 times making, I learned how to do the Rubik's cube correctly
My next target is to do the cube fast like below
Distance between me and him seems to be long."
Sendai is getting a little cold a little and autumn is coming there
I like autumn because I like the color of brown and the fallen leaves
Fallen leaves make me feel the fragility of life
I like the sound of the leaves when I step on it the leaves
Anyway, I've been belonging on the track and field club for 11 years from the since junior high school
Since I'm a relatively thin, high jump is my event ever
Today, Sendai has a clear autumn sky, and a temperature which that is not too hot or cold. Just right make for me to relax
It is very comfortable to lie  lay on the mat of for the high jump and stare absently into the sky in the on days where the weather is fair like today fair weather like today
In fact maybe over in 5 or 6 hours the meeting will start soon(xx)"

If there were good application (applications) of the scientific devices for (in) the cafe, I (would) want to know."
It's been has past several weeks since that I had posted my last diary entry
During the recent last few weeks, I had been practicing for the Ekiden, a meeting organized by electrical faculty of the graduate university
First, I will try to explain about Ekiden simply
But the big difference between full marathon and Ekiden is that you can running alone or not
In Ekiden, a runner is equiped a Tasuki which is like a towel bonding its edges as a baton
To express(describe) the appearance of the Tasuki is very difficult :p
Each runner runs their own course and gives the Tasuki to the next runner
So we had the Ekiden meet at last Saturday
2 years ago, we could got 5th place (prize) and last year we got 4th place (prize
Since we had good freshman and practice, we could got 3th place (prize
So, we could had the most enjoyable time in the Oden party after the Ekiden for recent since the past 3 years
I hope junior colleagues would get a better the more good result in next year
I'm now watching an Egyptian demonstration on Web TV
They seems to have stopped to connect the internet. (This is hard to understand. Did you mean they they stopped connecting or can't connect to the internet? Or do you mean that they stopped in the park so that they could connect to the internet

Today I was decided to attempt to write something
I usually find it easy to read technical documents and watch films in English but absolutely can't write in English."
I wanted to help somebody, but there are not many people who study the russian language
I love my language, foreigners tell say that it is weird and that it is difficult to study, they are just affraid of difficulties
I am proud to be Russian and to speak Russian, but it has another side a downside: I can't get rid of my accent, because we have a strong and tough pronounciation
1st of September is the worst day, (that day) my studies will begin

There were so many people; like polite and nice Japanese, Korean, who laugh the all time, crazy smoked african fulled of energy,horney pakistani and turkish guys,always drunk german,french,english,american,canadian,new zealand people... This sentence is a grammatical nightmare, there are just to many commas. English speakers wouldn't speak like this. You'd be better off to break it into separate sentences.  
I even cant can't even remember them all
I am waiting for your comments, it would be so nice of u you to correct me
Writing \"u\" instead of \"you\" ,   \"cuz\" instead of \"because\" and \"yr\" instead of \"your\" is a bad habit catched from american people which I caught from the Americans. I can't help it."
I have  watched this movie today
I was searching for this movie for quite some time now
I don't know why it  was removed from Russian DVD shops for being \"too christian
Probably only 5 % of it's plot is christianity and the rest of it is a love story
There is fairy tale about love or a tale about fairy love
And I couldn't help stop crying
I have never cried over films, that is this was the first film which touched me so deeply
I can also tell about would also like to talk about the amazing actor's amazing performance and its great soundtracks
I got used to traditional American happy endings  and I hoped that everything will would be  all right  until the last moment

Before yesterday all the Japanese patients were in Western Japan, but today, at last, two patients were found in Tokyo, East Japan
The government and media cry that \"Attention please!\" But I know almost all students are happy with the clothing of their school. [I'm confused why you're suddenly writing about clothing and school here... It's grammatically correct, but I don't understand

There is all-too-common topic, the work place of brain is different when human understand each language

Unlucky day:( Could be called \"An unlucky day\", it just sounds more correct to me, but I can't exactly pin it down, so I haven't changed it
Yesterday I was unlucky. Your point would get across clearer if you said you were veryunlucky. But that's just my opinion
I was_found to have written wrong years on very important documents.The sentence could also be \"I found that I had written the wrong years on very important documents.\" but for now I'll make the least amount of changes. '_' mean spaces, the site has trouble putting spaces between corrections and words
I have never noticed how old I am.I would suggest putting this before or after you talk about the mistake. It breaks the flow of thought. Try putting it either after \"Yesterday I was unlucky.\", before \"Second, I lost my cellphone\", or maybe after \"I am very regretful
I have to go to correct the documents
The documents will relate my future's job. It depends, do the documents relate to your future job now? Or do they not relate to it now, but will in thefuture
SecoundSecond, I lost my cellphone. Probably just a typing mistake
I found my backpack was opened, but_and_I_went back_to_my home with it opened. I don't really know what you mean to say, but I tried. Once more, the '_' are spaces
I'm very_regretful
I hope to find my cellphone, and I manage to improve my carelessness."

I'd like to share a story about a man who is my friend and a woman who is his girlfriend
One day, She served him a meal
He ate it and said “Oh,this bread is nice and tastes good.”
Suddenly, she got angry and said \"Are you trying to say that only the bread is good and that my cooking is not
He was surprised that she said this
Of course he didn’t mean to offend her
On another day, after a meal, he said to her “I had your meal deliciously.”
She was angered and said \"You're saying that you my cooking was bad and that you were able to successfully eat it all.\" This quote is rather confusing, sorry if my editing changes the meaning, I'm just not sure what you are intending the man's wife to be saying
The following day, he told me about it and  he told me that he doesn’t know what he should say to her
to her
Are these examples just differences in the thinking of men and women
or should he choose what he says more carefully

Intermadiate class, it may be a little hard for me
But as from for intermediate class study free-talking so even if it will be beyond me, I want to try it
But I didn't go today
Why english is felt like loads for me? Why does learning English feel like a burden to me? (Is that what you're trying to say
I want to talk English with native speakers directly  every day
Cause I don't want to study at a desk
But It isnt easy
because my town isn't big so there aren't many foreigners
And I want to learn variety of expressions
If I read books every day? Practice speaking continually

When I was elementary school student, rollerskating was very popular
So I used to play with my friends everyday
One day, I rollerskated with 2 friends 
Suddenly, I slipped and fell. My left ankle was sprained
It was really, really painful
My two friends approached me and said \"Are you ok
Actually, I wasn't ok because I felt like I almost died but I replied, \"I'm ok
Since it was so painful, I couldn't dare to go home alone by walking
However, my character is a little shy
So I couldn't ask anyone to help me
One friend said to me, \"Shall I take you home
I said politely, \"No, I can go home alone.\" (OK
At that time, the other friend said to one friend, 
I don't care. She said she can go home alone
I was in pain so I couldn't think anything
but then I could think of this
Damn it' :-(  I could have kept our friendship
Anyway, finally I said I will go home alone and so I went home alone while nearly creeping. [creeping.. maybe use another word.. ah, but I can't figure a replacement for it now  @_@; 
I arrived at home and I stayed in bed
The next day, I wore a cast
Although I went through that time, I got along with the other friend well, but I still disliked her and thank the helpful friend. [It's very confusing which two friends are you talking about. Please be more specific - I'm not sure if I understood correctly
At first, in my mind, I blamed myself after I parted from her
However, I can't remember her name, but I remember she was a kind friend."
I watched one movie to familiarize myself (or familiarise if you're learning European English) with  the British English accent
It's a teen movie
Though its story is obvious, the handsome lead man made me happy:D
As I watched that movie about 4-5 times, the OST is quite accustomed to hear. (? I don't understand
The band The Stiff Dylans! (You don't need aposrophes for bands =) 
The man is a part of the band in movie, then they sang two songs. (Write out your numbers
One is \"Ever Fallen in Love\", the other is \"Ultraviolet.\" (Captialize titles and put the quotation maks after periods
A good looking TV star is better, but for singers, having an attractive voice is most important thing to me
After watched that movie, I visited (or went on) the England site, because I couldn't find, downloaded the band's songs
I found more of their songs and one site where I can download a variety songs
Oops, actually, 'Ever fallen in love'isn't their song and there's many versions sung by many singers. (We call that a cover song when someone plays a song from another band
I love The Stiff Dylans' version
Before this movie, my favorite was  the\"Mamma Mia\" OST
Already as you know, all these things are famous ABBA songs
Of course I had known their a few of their songs, but hadn't liked them very much
My heroes are the patriots
It was about second grade in elementary school when I first thought about my hero
One day, the teacher gave me a paper which asked a few questions about me
One of the questions asked 'who do you respect
but I haven't my hero
I started to think of someone who is a worthy answer to that question
Eventually, I thought of someone
His name is King Seo-Jong
He created Han-gul with the help of scholars to improve his nation
At the time, we were using Chinese character
 not quite sure what you mean by this one. Maybe \"We borrowed these characters for writing
There characters weren't really ours and many people were illiterate. 
What do you mean unreal hero? Like he wasn't a realistic hero
Later on during high school I enjoyed the subject 'Korean modern history' from the Joseon era to present time
Even though I'm not good at Korean history, I used to get good grades in Korean modern history
I don't know if you already knew, but at one point Korea was a colony of Japan
Not quite 100% sure what you mean in this one
There were many patriots who resisted
They resisted not only by force, but also by writing poems, novels, etc. (I especially like the ?resistive? poem
They were not afraid of death and some patriots sacrificed themselves for their country
Could I do that if it happen again
I am really thankful to them and every ancestors who made an effort to protect our culture
One thing more, It's unfortunate that descendants of the traitors are very wealthy because they inherited many things by flattering the Japanese
Patriots' descendants, on the other hand, are really poor since their father or grandfather gave-up their family to devote himself(Usually men
Their families couldn't afford education
I wish that they got more respect."
I, however,grew up at Tokyo
Everytime I go back to Tokyo and see the Tokyo Tower, I feel relaxed

I'd like to briefly describe the Chinese Spring Festival
I had prepared a lot of food, such as dumplings, meat balls, fish, etc in the new year's eve like the previous spring festival, so that I didn't need to buy anything during the vacation
I stuck couplets on two sides of the door of my parents house, after that I worked some firecrackers, eating dumplings, watching the Spring Festival gala play on TV while my family spent the whole day with my parents at their house
And my family spent the whole day with my parents on the first day of Chinese New year
My family also spent the whole day with my parents-in-law on the second day of the Lunar New Year
I had had dinner with close friends, relations and colleagues for drinking wine on the third day, the fourth day and sixth day
I went to the Catacombs to worship the ancestor on the fifth day as tradition
I went to work and started working on the seventh day."
The mandarin is the language that many kinds of north nomads or minority nationality enter or invaded the Central Plains had been belonging to Han nationally in ancient Chinese, then imitate and try to speak to the ancient han nationality, then learning not too good, so became the so called mandarin.

So I think that those place with dialect of south of the Yangtze River is more like or close the sound of ancient Han nationality especially cantonese and inland Min dialects almost as the ancient han nationality. (我不明白。原句子是什么？）
This explains why Cantonese literature is so rich and diverse compared to Mandarin literature in China(, which is rather poor and shallow)."

The concert was held at the musical instrument musiumium and it was great
Three friends of mine in Hamamatsu were going to travel by a camping car the that evening
They didn't plan where to stay, as usual
It was extraordinalily r warm and comfortable that I hadn't known at all
Next morning when the car passed over Kobe, I made my mind up, not to get off the car, but to go to Hiroshima together with them
The water was low when we visited(I forgot how to describe this), so we were able to walk to the gate. (\/ The tide was receding and the sea floor was exposed when we arrived so we were able to walk to the gate on foot
There is a mountain called Misen where a famous Buddhism monk, Kuukai, opened a saint place
It is only 500 meters something high(I don't know how to say 500何メートル
Our stomachs were not big enough to taste all of them
They were going to find a good onsen or hot spring for the night
I remembered that an old friend boutht g a condo opposite Miyajima recently
She recommended a good onsen nearby that she just went to the previous day
She never told me what to do but she was helpinged me make the goals clear andon how to accomplish them myself
We decided which day of the week and what time we will talk over the phone onabout what's would be going regularlyon.There might be a better way on this to fix it but I just can't think of it at the current time
The next day, my Hamamatsu friends went to another island named Shodo-shima, and I took a local train back to Kobe
It cost was about 4,000 yen cheaper than shinkansen, but it took over 5 hours
I couldn't buy any food or drink till the second station because of there was no time.alt: because I had no time
5 piesces of gum eased me
I enjoyed myself looking out of the window

On another note, depending on how you feel about comma's you might just want to recreate the sentence

(\"by a helicopter\" is grammatically okay, but think of \"I go to school by bus
That's amazing and great!!! ([adjective] and [adjective] sounds a little awkward, but \"amazing\" refers to how hard to believe something is while \"great\" refers to how good it is, so in this situation the double-adjective is okay. But please try not to overuse punctuation.)"

I'm sorry I haven't replied to each message yet that I received while I was absent, but I really appreciated them
I'm going to have a minor operation at a hospital this week
I won't be able to go to Tokyo this time
Luckily, she came to Kyoto for a four-day trip this Monday, so I went to see her there yesterday
There is a famous temple named 東寺(Toji) near Kyoto station, and a big antique market is held there on the 21st of every month
Yesterday was the very day
We met at the station at about 10:30 and walked there
There were lots of people gathered there and lots of stores selling old kimonos, food and hand crafts, as well as antiques
I found an interesting carved ornament which cost 38,000 yen
We walked around for a while, however, there were too many people and too many things to attract me 
A nice smell attracted us
We got in the queue at once
They called it いか焼き(ika-yaki), and it was quite small and 200 yen that
That, I thought, was why it was popular. Or: I thought that that was why it was so popular. Yes, two \"that
There were chairs for sitting
A foreign couple, sitting next to us, were sharing a piece of ika-yaki
It was interesting to see the girl taking lots of かつおぶし(katsuo-bushi) or slices of dried bonito as an aside
She seemed to hate it
Inside the temple, we also enjoyed seeing lots of statues of 曼荼羅(Mandala), Buddhism's heaven and earth
One of the statues named 帝釈天(Taishaku-ten) ???? riding an elephant was really handsome
Also, we entered the five-storied pagoda or 五重塔(gojuu-no-tou
I didn't know that it was built as a grave of some saints and that it had burned down four times after it was first built in 883, but it has never been destroyed by an earthquake
Before leaving there nearly 4:00, I dropped by the store again to just see the carved ornament once again, and then, surprisingly, the shope person started to give me a discount
He said, \"It is very good, but you can buy it for 8,000 yen.\" I couldn't believe it because he was reducing the price by 30,000 yen
I began to check it carefully, and then he even said, \"Okay, it's just 7,000 yen
Please take it.\" How can he discount it 31,000 yen
I thought to myself, \"Perhaps, it was not as good as the price seemed to indicate at the beginning.\" A customer's mind, it's funny, isn't it
This time, we took the train to get back to Kyoto station, even though it was only one-station distance
After buying an 駅弁 (ekiben), a colourful delicious meal in a box, we talked again about our future plans at a cafe for a while
We really had a nice time, and said good-bye at about 5:30 p.m
I would really appreciate it if you would correct any incorrect usage or unnatural expressions of mine."
I thought it was just 'tissues' even though it is they are pocket-sized, but I was not sure then
How about the case of tissues, which is made of bamboo, plastic or wood? (this sounds kind of strange. probably just: \"How about the case of tissues

Today, my English teacher pointed out that I often tend to speak in an abstract way frequently in conversation
For example, when I say \"go out in society\" in a sentence; he said I should use \"start working\" instead. (You had too many commas before. :) I'd have to check the punctuation rules to make sure the semi-colon I used is correct
In addition, he also said \"international situation\" can be paraphrased \"what's going on in the world\", and \"feature\" can be said \"what makes us different
I become stressed when I learn the way of thinking that are shown in the expressions of the Japanese and English languages

Do you think the Japanese government should accept more immigrants
I agree with the statement that Japan should accept more immigrants from abroad to combat the problems of declining birthrate and an aging population
A number of immigrants want jobs in Japan and they work hard because they want to improve their lives

By the way, do you know have you heard of \"Nagori-yuki
Yuki\" means snow, \"Nagori\" means like lingering farewell, I think
Nagori-yuki\" is a kind of snowfall in Spring
It sometimes snows in March around Tokyo, or and also in the southern part of Japan
In March, spring has already come, and no snow are there usually. it usually doesn't snow
In spring, we do new things, like entering schools andgetting new jobs, therefore we may have to move to new places. 
We may then have to be separated from loved ones
There might be a sentimental scenes here and there
While we are reluctant to say good bye at a station platform or somewhere
Just at that moment, it starts snowing sentimentally even dramatically. *We wouldn't really say 'snowing sentimentally' or 'dramatically'. Maybe 'snowing softly'? 
We call this snow \"Nagori-yuki
So it doesn't mean just snow in Spring
Some sentimental feeling is there in \"Nagori-yuki
Nagori- yuki\" is the name of a popular song originally, I'm sorry I'm not sure who the artist was
My own \"Nagori-yuki\" moment was
at a long long time ago
I had left my girlfriend at a station platform of in my hometown and came to Tokyo about a quarter of a century ago

Anyway, I am afraid it will be very cold in the building after several holiday days without heating., you know

I took the TOEIC test after work yesterday
I think that I could have done better but I got it done anyway
Concentration during the listening section is very important, but it was hard for me to do so yesterday
I suppose it would be better to not take such a tough test on Friday evening after work
One would probably be tired from working all week and would surely find it difficult to concentrate on the test for a long time
I could enjoy taking the test this time though
I like English even more than before
I think that's why I enjoyed the test
That is, thanks to you here in Lang-8, even if you were only a small part
I thank you from the bottom of my heart. (This is a more common English phrase

I wonder if I got a higher score that before."

The discussions mainly consisted of an introduction and presentation about the institutes and the activities they carry out, and we asked many questions. (I suggest starting a new like \"We also asked many questions\" so as to not put too much information in one sentence
We could have had very fruitful discussions and got\/learned a lot of new informations and knowledges. \"Information\" and \"knowledge\" are both part of a category we call \"uncountable nouns.\" That is, they are words which cannot be counted and are usually treated as singular

We went over the outline of it today and checked the marathon course by walking the actual course
The total distance was about 10km
I ran at an easy pace and it felt good."
Today's party is easier with one with my friends
We were also colleagues at my former office, but we are now kindred-spirit friends
Today's party is a farewell party for celebrating his mandatory retirement and honoring, appreciating his long time efforts
But it will be an absolutely casual, frank, and happy party
I am looking forward to seeing friends who haven't seen me for a while at the party
I went to a party one a week ago Wednesday, didn't I
Not same \"a week ago Wed. and last Wed.?)It's better in this case to say \"I went to a party last Wednesday, didn't I
and last Wed.?) That was the one with my colleague at my present office that I planned. It was for making better more nomi-nication. (I'm not sure what you where trying to say here in blue
Do you think I have a lot of parties? (This is written properly, it it suggests that you are the one throwing the party. If you mean that you attend many parties, it might be better to say 'Do you think I go to a lot of parties
No, I have less than one a month on average
On the wagon\" is an interesting phrase, isn't it
It means to \"stop drinking\", or \"not drinking\" alcohol
Anyway, I will enjoy the party this evening."
I wanted to report a good and positive story to you, so I was able to hang in there and keep running to the finish gate instead of giving up
I am very happy to have finished it\/it's over
And I am very pleased to have (be able to) post good news as well
I am bothered by bad coughs these days, I think it has been more than three weeks
The clinic was full of patients and I had to wait for about one and a half hours there before seeing the doctor
He checked my throat, the sound of my chest, and took an X-ray photo of my lungs, and then said it was not serious and that I had to take some medicines
I hope my cough will go away soon
I had planned a casual party at a Chinese restaurant to enhance the friendship between me and my coworker
We enjoyed delicious Chinese cuisine and drinks, and we also enjoyed chatting about various things around us
I will plan the next event soon again
We have a high school reunion party of our high school today
It is the one of the semiannual parties for alumni in the Tokyo area held in every spring and every autumn
Our high school is in Hiroshima, which is famous for peace something. It is located about 1000km east of Tokyo. (I'm not sure what you mean by \"peace something
I will be able to see my friends today after a long while. (Or \"Today, I will be able to see friends that I haven't seen in a long while\/time
Furthermore, our reunion\/old soccer club has soccer games in the morning
I will take part in them, of course
I am looking forward to it very much too
The soccer games in the morning, and the reunion party at night with my old friends will take me back to my youth
Should it be sounds fun? (What part did you want to replace with \"sounds fun\" 
I can't wait (for it)."
Yesterday was the day of the harvest moon in Japan, it's called \"Chushu no meigetsu

I jogged back home from work under the harvest moon that was shining very brightly and beautifully
We celebrate the growth and health of girls while displaying many beautiful Hina dolls at each family's house
Odairi-sama and Ohina-sama, which represent the Emperor and the Empress, and many servants are set on a five or seven tiered platform
My family used to displaysimply two Hina dolls which are the Odairi-sama  and the Ohina-sama  for my daughter
Happy birthday to Dad
I hope he will live a long time without disease."
I'm sure spring will come here in our place soon
The early kind of sakura is now has already started blooming
They are 20% in blooming now
We Japanese loves sakura
I also look forward to it
I am getting tired with this cold winter
I don't like spring very much because of this only from this point of view
After it rained, it became much cooler
Fall is finally right here, in Japan. [I'm not sure about that comma, but I think it would go there
We all wished fall would come soon during the very hot summer
We welcome this fall very much
Do you have any plans to enjoy this fall
My wife and son will go for a sightseeing in Nara today
I hope they can have a lot of fun on this trip
I am wondering if I should buy a pair of boots
I love it them, but my feet felt the boots feel a little small and tight
I want bigger ones
Because of the strong yen these days, I can take advantage of directly importing a pair of boots
Even with the shipping cost, I can get one at a lower cost from the US by importing directly than buying them in Japan
I am planing planning to buy a new pair of boots at from the eBay shop
I was shivering and almost did not sweat
Maybe I am."
I sent an email and received the reply
I sent this email to the Singapore Economic Development Board's Tokyo Office
And I received the reply for it yesterday
It said that we could visit the Tokyo Office and talk about the visit in some institutes in Singapore
It is getting easier(?) to visit Singapore
I feel happy about it
Losing weight
My weight was 65.4 kilograms after dinner yesterday
I think I am losing weight at a good rate
My goal is 63 kilos
By running more and dieting, I will lose weight
I think it is important to take it easy and not to rush for it
My son will be taking the entrance examination for the his first choice university of his first choice tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
He is not very nervous now. (You could say \"yet\" instead of \"now\". Either works
He seems positively excited. (This sounds more natural
He has been enjoying studying all kinds of subjects at his own pace, which makes me happy. (I combined this with the next sentence
I am glad that
Am I more nervous than he is? (You could also say \"Am I more nervous than him
It was a half-marathon held at very hilly course near Mt
For the 1st half, the approximately 10km straight uphills, and the 2nd half, the 10km straight downhills, knocked me out
Both my legs and whole body screamed
I forced myself not to stop or walk along the way, and to keep my mind strong
I hung in there
I could finish the tough race done
Anyway, I felt good with the nice weather, the nice tough course, and my nice spirit
After a long-awaited rain
After a long-awaited rain, which was not heavy, I felt it getting more humid and colder
Even though spring has come on the calendar in Japan, but it is still cold every day
On the other hand, from the middle of February Your month abbreviations are correct, but they are not normally used to write a journal
to the middle of March
some snow falls here in the Kanagawa and Tokyo areas every year
We don't get any snow throughout the winter, but we do get some at the beginning of spring
I picked up some dis unused articles around my desk and got rid of the unwanted things
I decide to throw out some magazines, books, CDs, clothes and things like that
Some of them are going to be brought to a recycle shop
I wonder if I should list some of them on an online auction
I wonder if someone wants my garbage things."
I left significant documents and notebooks that I needed to reference for today's job in my office
I was in a hurry at my office last night because the lock-out time was very close
I had to bring them back home to take them to another office today
I felt like I was not standing straight on foot
I was not a dizzy, but just had a strange feeling as if I got was drunk or after had a sleepless night
I am sure I am suffering from some (sort of) summer fatigue or something like that
I think I must take care of myself and must take get some good rests
To drink enough water and take salt so as not to get a heat stroke
Anyway, this summer will go finish soon. Using \"finish\" is more natural
It will not be longer until before it will be cooler
This is only a few weeks of patience
I will relax myself during this weekend."
After the long over time last night
I ran back home from work around midnight yesterday, no it was already today
After a long over time, I enjoyed a refreshed run in the silent and dark at midnight
I worked until so late to make a resume for a meeting for early the next morning with the president, co-president of my lab, the president and the co-president of another lab
I completed the resume at about twenty to midnight
But I had some snacks in the afternoon, so I didn't feel very hungry 
Well, It is time to go to the meeting
I had better not yawn there
I will probably have no time to yawn
The mountains look like they are on fire
The mountains are turning yellow and are covered with cedar pollen, They look like they are on fire
They are flying through the air and will attack us
The hayfever medicine makes me oversleep
They are so close, and 
They get along very well
Which phrase is adequate?The two sentences are cause and result related. You can use both together or just either of them. Either way is fine
At the dinner, the night before my son's entrance examination, his sister gave him a piece of her pork cutlets
She likes cutlets, so we asked her \"Are you full enough?\" She smiled and said \"This is the \"CUTLET\", eh
She wished for his success on his exam, so she gave it to him
The sound of \"cutlet\" and \"Katsu\", which means \"win\" , are the same and saying \"Ton-katsu tabete uma-katta\", is very popular
But literally it means \"I ate pork cutlets
It was delicious.\", but it can also mean \"A horse ate pork cutlets and won.\" \"Uma\" means horse
What nice siblings they are
I am happy because my very nice and close family is so full of family love."
Last night I received the divers' watch that I bought on eBay
It is a mid size automatic watch that was made about 20 years ago
I fell in love with it at first sight
It is heavier than usual quartz watches, because it is an automatic mechanical  type that is made for heavy duty use. \"Quartz\" is the crystal that they use for watches and clocks. \"Quarts\" is the plural of the unit of measurement \"quart
It doesn't require any batteries
It is economical, isn't it?."
My kids was are back from their short trip
This wasis a story fromsome days ago. My two children, a son and a daughter,  went on a short trip to Fukuoka induring their spring holidays
They went to Haneda Airport by train and to Hakata International Airport in Fukuoka by air, alone by themselves
My brother lives in Fukuoka with his family, including two of my nephews
There are two of my two nephews
TheMy nephews also loved to meet and play with them
My children loved the castle very much and sent me its photo via cell phone email of the cell phone
But, of course, the lie cannot hurt others, it's only meant as light-hearted fun
I think it's meant for us to enjoy the humour in life and not be so serious
It is not good to tell lies everyday, so on one day a year we can tell one little, innocent lie
It seems difficult for me to tell a happy lie. or It doesn't seem to be easy for me to tell a happy lie
I wonder if I don't have a sense of humor
What funny or happy lies have you told before on April Fool’s day
In the summer, we have a lot of fireworks festivals in Japan
We Japanese love to go out and watching firework shows while wearing them in Yukatas, which are the traditional summer clothes of Japan
Yukatas are a kind of Kimonos. 
Women and girls (like to\/tend to) go out with wearing Yukatas in\/during summer, nowadays, for example, to go summer festivals or something like that
Men and boys rarely go out in Yukatas
Where We men wear the Yuaktas mostly are probably at when at a Japanese style inns, after taking a bath in\/after bathing in a hot spring
So we were lucky enough to can luckily enjoy watching it just outside our house, we didn't have to need to take a trains or anything
The only thing we are sorry about is we can't enjoy wearing a Yukatas, because neighbors and us don't usually wear Yukatas when we are near around our houses to watch fireworks
If you communicate with someone, you share and exchange informations with them
The I think mutual communication is much better than the one-way communication, I think
Mutual communications would bring us many worth- things such as mutual understanding, happy feelings, smiles, love, new ideas, and something better like that than one-way communication do. (Things you could not get through one-way communication
If you want to make a mutual communication mutually communicate with someone, you can start by saying hello with warm smile to them at first
On this site lang8, to writing an entry, making a correction or leaving a comment, on it, and replying to a comment or leaving back another correction on their entry is a kind of great mutual communication
I did not reply to all of your corrections and comments on lang8
I always appreciate it."
Three cold days and four warm ones
These days, a cold day is followed by a warm one which is then followed by the next cold one
We have a four-kanji-character-expression \"三寒四温（さんかんしおん）\", which means three cold days and four warm days
When Spring is approaching, it gets warmer with the cycle of three cold days followed by four warm days
Especially in this Spring, the cycle seems to me to consist of a single cold day and a single warm one
I wonder what clothes I should wear everyday
Even if I fall asleep, I wake up one or two hours later
My sleep seems like very light
Of course, I feel sleepy in the daytime, especially after lunch
Do you have any good ideas?"
First workday in 2010
Today January the 5th is the first workday in 2010 for of my company
I hope I will be able to do a many good jobs this year too
Even though your sentence seems correct, the sentence structure is something a Japanese native may say. I think you should use this alternative as an example how to properly set up a sentence.Ex: Even though the recent recession has hit us hard, we should try and work harder so we can recover our economy this year. (Hopefully this year
OK, It's just a time to make get ready for going for my job
Good luck for everyone
Are there some troubles on Lang-8
I could not log into Lang-8 this morning
Are there some troubles on Lang-8
I got able to log in around 5 pm
Many friends of mine make kind corrections and comments on my journals every day
Luckily, I could come back here and hope this service will be available for a long time."
I only managed to fixed it by only rebooting the ADSL modem, the rooter and PCs
I am the only one in my family who can fix the trouble problems like that
I wonder I have to if I should teach my family how to reboot them
We have a marathon today
Many participate
I am one of the volunteers organizing it
We've been preparing for several months
We set the race site and course all day yesterday
I am in charge of the site as one of the chief staff today
I hope we will able to organize it well and also help the participants enjoy the race very much."
I signed up to Facebook, which is a social networking site. (I haven't seen this abbreviation being used in England - that's not to say it's wrong though, it's just unusual
However I didn't use it very much in the past because I didn't have friends using the service
It is getting popular now in Japan due to the movie about a SNS social networking sites
Several old friends of mine signed up to Facebook recently and found me, and sent me messages
A very long time has \/ had passed since the last time we met actually
I think the progress of the information communication technology is amazing
My wife and I enjoy the pot gardening
The tomatoes are species of small fruits and the bell peppers are of red and yellow fruits
In This summer, we have harvested many tomato fruits from the tomato plants
The tomato plants have grown surprisingly fast and fruited a lot of tomatoes
They are very fresh, concentrated and delicious. ここには「Concentrated」訳すと、一番似ている意味は「濃い」という意味・・・ちょっと違いますね。
We enjoyed them at breakfast almost everyday
They are also very fresh, thick and will surely be delicious
There was a news yesterday
We have been studying about some research and development strategies since last spring
I was surprised to have found that one of the members was an alumni of my high school
He was an alumni who was 4 years my senior 
I found out about it yesterday
It is very rare to meet my alumni here in Kanagawa, or Tokyo, which are in the Kanto area, because my high school is in Hiroshima
I worked until around midnight last night
Unfortunately, it started raining in the late evening, 
so I had to run back home around midnight via\/by the short route straight in the rain with my umbrella
But it is not easy to run with an umbrella."
She wanted to do some exercises because she finished her regular high school exam. of her high school
We went into the night neighbor for jogging. ?? with your neighbor...? I don't understand
We enjoyed it very much
The cool and pleasant breeze felt very good."
It was my son
On the last train he missed the station nearest to our home, because he fell asleep
He sometimes does this
His midnight call from the end of the line woke me up and I drove the car to pick him up
It takes only fifteen minutes to get to the terminal station
They were a little too much, even for me
Do you know the acronym \"LSD\"?(LSD is also known as an infamous and illegal hallucinogenic drug in the west =O haha
I ran the day before yesterday for about 4 and a half hours
I don't think I ran at a slow enough pace for LSD
It should be called LD without the \"S
Anyway, I ran
That was including the practice run for the ekiden relay race on next Sunday; my part will be a 4.8km downhill. Also, on the way of my so called LSD, I visited a temple at somewhat deep in the mountains to thank for the good results on our son and daughter's entrance exam. 
I planned not to get too tired for the 10k race tomorrow(?) by running at an easy pace
This should be connected to the previous sentence: I planned not to get too tired for the 10k race tomorrow(?) by running at an easy pace, but I underestimated the inclines of going up and down the hills
I was exhausted
We had soccer games today
We come together to play soccer only once a year for this activity
But we enjoy playing soccer with each other because we had graduated from the same high school and had played at the same playground long time ago
I am have been looking forward to this event for a long time very much
I am worried about the weather, but it seems like we don't won't have rain today, at least before noon
It is a rather new holiday and was established in 1996
It is celebrated on the third Monday in July
This is a party for the alumni who graduated from a high school in Hiroshima, held in Tokyo
Hiroshima is not very close to Tokyo, but many alumni are living in the Tokyo metropolitan area
We have alumni parties twice a year, which are held in the spring and fall annually
I am looking forward to going attending the party
But I have a work
I have to leave the office early to go there
I wonder if I can make it. I want to leave the office early before the usual finish time today."
There was an entrance ceremony of at our son's university yesterday
Unfortunately, it was raining and much too much cold for April unfortunately
He looked like being proud
I now have two problems regarding internet shopping
These are some sort of delivery errors, I guess
First, the replacement of a faulty watch which I bought on eBay haven't arrived yet
The replacement seems to have got lost somewhere on the globe. -- if you wanted to emphasise that it could be anywhere, I'd say \"... somewhere in the world
I contacted the seller but.... -- but... what
Finally, there was also coffee, which is ordered through an internet coffee shop I used constantly, seems to have been lost too
What on earth is happening around me
I hope they will be delivered soon."
Are my shoes shrinking or are my feet growing
My shoes may have became tighter or my feet may have swelled up
My toe nails have turned black and I have some blisters on one of my toes and the soles of my feet
Yesterday, I suddenly came up with an idea
It is simple. was a simple way As follows
I removed the insoles from my Mizunos to make it less tight\/to loosen them
Don't you think it is was a good idea
This was my the first run without the insoles
Without insoles, the shoes felt harder but not that bad
My toe had some room in my shoes and it felt more comfortable and was less painful
Mmm, I want a new pair of shoes of bigger size
We were very glad to see him playing and to hear his name on TV
Unfortunately, his team lost after the in extra time of the game unluckily, but they played a very exciting game
I got a new PR on yesterday's marathon! I am not too sure what PR stands for (personal record?) You may want to write out what this means
It was about 4 minutes less than my old one
We could run on a very nice course and in a very good weather conditions
It is written using \"kanji\" and \"hiragana
I will have an endoscope examination today. (A person takes a school exam, but a person has a medical exam
So I called it a day early yesterday because I have to have dinner before 9 PM to take the exam. (You can say PM or p.m
I don't like an endoscope checkups
The endoscope comes into my stomach through my nose
It is even better than through the mouth, but it is still very uncomfortable
But it is still very uncomfortable for us
I picked up the phrase as \"To know is one thing, and to teach is quite another thing.\" I definitely agree with that
I should know Japanese very well because I am a native Japanese speaker\/person
I sometimes find it very difficult to correct Japanese on lang-8er's entries
They are learning Japanese at different levels
My friends always corrects my English very well
A Fulfilling Week Since you're describing your week, you should use the adjective \"fulfilling
I suggest: I felt fulfilled this week
First, I was busy on my the job, where I have a lot of tasks to do. Also possible: First, I was busy with my job, for which I have many tasks to do. 
For example, I had some meetings with (someone at first time), gave a presentation to new employees concerning our section and made some important decisions regarding our research. I'm not quite sure what you mean with \"someone at first time.\" Do you mean \"I had some meetings with certain people for the first time\"? 
It This was because I have the TOEIC test this evening
Furthermore, I am one of the organizers  for the marathon event on this weekend
Do you mean \"We have to prepare something for it
It seems to me that time had\/has been running faster than usual
This fulfilling week really flew by."
Niigata is located by the Sea of Japan side of islands
I saw a lot of piled snow there
It seems hard to spend here in a winter with such an amount lot of snow
It had not been snowing in Niigata, but it snowed a lot in Tokyo yesterday evening, as the super express train back to home was delayed by the snow
We rarely have so much snow in the Tokyo area, so we are not used to this weather much snow
Therefore such snow make somewhat affects on our life, such as the train delays, for example."
The entry phone of our house rang, but no one was at the door
It has happened twice this week
Were they playing ding dong ditch
Otherwise was it something supernatural
In the Summer time, we say we may have some spiritual things lurking around
They must not be supernatural or spiritual things
I believe the entry phone rang accidentally because of some kind of electromagnetic noises
Hoping for world peace
On this day in 1945, one of the most historic disasters happened
Even today, some people are still suffering from the serious aftereffects
The house which I lived in and my parents have been living in was also exposed and very little is still left due to the blast
I hope for world peace
Let's pray for the world peace
We must do what we can do for it
And a Happy New Year 
a little bit faster too early 
Have you ever heard (of) the word \"Syu-Ha-Ri
At the beginning of studying something, we need to keep to the teaching of our seniors
At the next step, we break the principle and make some alterations to it. (I changed this because \"principle\" is singular but \"them\" is plural. You could also say \".. we break the principles and make some alterations to them
It is good to learn \/for learning
Next, we separate from the teaching (altogether) and make our own way on the things
I'll keep it in my mind, and I intend to do it."
The wireless LAN in my house seemed to have some troubles
I checked the preferences and the connection setups, but I couldn't fix it
I bought a new wireless receiver and set it to my PC, but the wireless LAN was still unstable, so I even bought a new wireless LAN router to set it
It became very comfortable again. A bit strange to use \"comfortable\". This implies that before, it was \"uncomfortable\" because you could not use the wireless LAN. Maybe it is best to say \"It became usable again
I ran a race today in the showering rain, but it was not very cold
In the showering rain, but it was not very cold, so I enjoyed running on the wet road
Sometimes I stepped into pods, so my shoes got soaked and they became heavier
Anyways, the rain race I ran was very fun
We walked through an old abandoned tunnel, where we didn't know exactly know where we were
In the tunnel, we felt something was standing behind us, but we could not turn around because we were afraid
I think it was something spiritual thing."
Cleaning up our house(家の大掃除）
Yesterday, my wife and I cleaned up our house.（昨日、私和妻と家の大掃除をしました。）
It is a yearly year-end cleaning, as to say \"年末大掃除\".（今日は大晦日だから年末大掃除と言う。）
Cleaned up rooms, removed dusts, wiped windows, vacuum cleaned, threw some unneeded goods and books, washed screen doors, and so on, thoroughly.（部屋の掃除、塵を取り除いて、窓を拭いて、使ってないところも掃除して、いらない物と本を捨てて、スクリーンも洗って、徹底的に掃除しました。
At the very least, we cleaned more rigorously than usual
The weather was mild that we had fun cleaning and were a bit exhausted
Thanks for the get-well messages
I don't have any words to say thank you. Or: \"I don't have the words to thank you
I think I can run right now, but it's raining outdoors, unfortunately
I don't want to run in the rain when I've while only just recovered from the sickness
I sometimes poured water over my head to cool my body off
I was fatigued but enjoyed it very much."
I ate too much during this winter
Before I realized it, I gained some weight
I ran a lot, but I ate more than my body needed for running
I should have checked my weight every day
I have to lose about 3 kilograms by dieting
It's crazy hot these days, even though (or although) fall began already started based on the calendar
We should be careful not to get dehydrated and not to get a heat stroke
The air conditioner in my bedroom has been out of order and unfortunately, it only blows only hot wind
It is 15 years old, so I ordered a new one
The new unit will arrive next week
We have the our office X'mas party tomorrow
It is held at the end of every year
We have an R&D conference before the party
We will have discussions about our R&D themes with others using posters that afternoon. 
I ran two races in a roll, a 10km race on Saturday and a 1\/2 marathon on Sunday 
This is one of a series of monthly marathons held on every second Saturday
It is because I have a half marathon the next day
It is named after Sontoku Ninomiya who is known in Japanese history as one of the great people who contributed to agricultural revolutions in Japan about 300 years ago
It was a beautiful sunny day, So I felt great while running
But my competitive personality didn't let me keep running slowly after other runners
Less smile but more serious look on my face
maybe
This was equal to my own record at this marathon
I was totally exhausted by these two races on two consecutive days
I had a meeting with the director of laboratory, who is my main boss,  alone yesterday
The meeting was held before the start of the business day
It was because he was busy all day except during that time.(This sounds more natural
That was the first time we talked alone without my immediate boss, so I was somewhat nervous before the meeting
We had a very fruitful discussion about my project. "
I will introduce you to my room where I am now studying
It is 3.5min width and 2.6m in depth and has 6 tatamis as a floor
There is a low table at in a corner, originally for using as the center table at a Japanese style living room, which I use for as my studying desk
There are is a pile of books stacking stacked on it
There This is my space
But there this is not my own, not only for me
There It is shared among my family, of course
Sometimes my son used uses my laptop there to study for his entrance exam
He will surely probably use his own and not use my one mine hereafter.Hereafter could also be said as \"from now on
His younger sister will sometimes use mine from now and then on for her studying
Well, anyway, I me and my family use the corner of the Japanese style room for studying
I think to I'll call it quits this time
Last episode of a TV drama
I watched the last episode of a TV drama, after watching the second to last episode as well
I would like to say it was really fun, but unfortunately, as always, it was not as fun as expected
I think it is very difficult to make a story very interesting from beginning to end
If it starts out very interesting, we expect it will be interesting until the end
The more we expect, the bigger the gap between the expectation and the reality will be
Anyway, I enjoyed the drama very much."
If I scratch more, I will feel itchier
It seems that I was bite by mosquitoes here and there on different places on my body
On my arms, legs, back, and so on
The bites feel very itchy
Even if they feel itchy, we should not scratch them
They will get itchier and itchier if we scratch there
Mosquito populations are increasing from now towards till the late summer
For about a week, it has not been very hot
Has the hot summer already ended
It's good for us, so we can reduce our electricity consumption
It may not be a good influences on some leisure industries as well
to where
It was freezing cold this morning under a cold wave (It is unclear what you mean by 'under a cold wave
The surface of the paved road surface felt harder than usual under my shoes than usual
My hands were so cold that I could not write nor type well
Morning glow was very beautiful because of the clear air."
We are now developing the new products and new enterprises for our company
We get both good experimental data and not so good data everyday
We also get some market informations from the marketing section
We do have good days with a lot of progresses and also not very good days without progresses, with some troubles instead
Anyway, we are progressing step by step, day by day, and will achieve the goal to produce new products for the market."
The weather forecast said the rainy season was ended in Japan yesterday. It is just a mid summer now
It is very shiny bright, sunny and dizzily hot today
Please take care not to get dehydrated or not to suffer from heat stroke
You had It's probably better not to be exposed to the sun shine and heat for a very long time
Enough water and electrolytes will help prevent you suffering from the heat attack
Take good care and enjoy summer as well much as possible."
A Big Earthquake. Are You OK? 
A big earthquake struck Japan
It was the biggest earthquake to hit Japan in 150 years
and the 5th largest in the world
A 10 meter height tsunami attacked the shore near the ground zero
Fortunately, my family and I are OK. 
I came back home around midnight after (doing) a lot of overtime last night
Yesterday, we ran a \"mara-nic,\" which means a MARAthon distance picNIC, yesterday
We started from at Odawara, climbed Hakone, and then headed to Mishima
It was very hot at the sea level, but somewhat cooler and more comfortable at the higher elevation levels
We enjoyed this crazy, tough running
There seemed to be some trouble with lang-8
Perhaps, a lot of users visited all at once, so the system might have hung up
Or some maintenances are being made
Do you have any ideas about this
In Japan, there is a word called\"nomi-nication
They coined this phrase by adding \"nomi\" to \"communication
we should make more communication with others with the help of some alcohol
In these days they say that we Japanese make less communications with others, especially with colleagues or business partners, than we used to before
I used to go for a drink with my colleagues, often including my boss, every weekend about ten years ago
But recently, we haven't
We go with close friends, but rarely with colleagues or bosses
Less communications causes poor relationships
Even the boss's frowning face may seem cute,  charming, handsome, or something like that,  as you know him more
So, I am planning a small dinner party with my working group by\/at the end of January
It was the coldest day of this winter, yesterday
And the weather forecast says it will be even colder today than it was yesterday
The road is somewhere frozen and icy, and very slippery especially in the morning
We should take care not to slip or to fall down
I wish spring will come soon."
I have just gotten though out from three year days of my three years of \"Yakudoshi
The method of measurement way is called \"Kazoe-toshi
This time my Yakudoshi is from the ages of 41 to 43, from Mae-yaku to Ato-yaku
It finished the day before yesterday, which was my 43rd birthday
I didn't experience any misfortunes or illnesses during my Yaku-doshi years
This is a Japanese belief that people at the ages of yakudoshi are likely to experience misfortunes or illnesses
Second, as a husband, I was not a very good husband
I love you. (可愛い！＾＾；
Next, as a runner, I enjoy running
I ran for more than 2000 miles of total distance this year.I ran a total distance of more than 2000 miles this year
I should have done more exercises practice with the balls
As an engineer, I haven't changed my much
It was an ordinary year as usual
We have something good and something not as good this year
Anyway, we laughed and smiled happily very many times
I have a summer vacation for a week starting from tomorrow
Unfortunately my wife will not have any days off next week, so we can't go on a trip to somewhere very far away
We are planning to go for a day trip near here by taking to the Hakone mountain railroad
We will enjoy taking the switch-back style train of the and seeing the beautiful scenery
In the rest days, I will enjoy taking a rest while doing something for myself. For example, reading books, cleaning rooms, gardening, jogging, etc
Maybe my summer vacation will fly by
Well, I wonder what I will do during it."
We had a welcome party for me yesterday night. [You could also say, \"last night
I had moved to another department in my office on April 16th
My new coworkers held the party to welcome me. 
Younger coworkers are in the new department, so the party was more cheerful the party was than my old department
We had many delicious meals
There was a unique menu item at the bar. 
It was deep fried gingers
Have you ever eaten this
I ate this for the first time
It was more delicious more than expected
We had a couple of very happy times at the bar while chatting casually since we had known each other with most of my new coworkers for some time
I was very happy to be welcomed and felt grateful for them."
Rainy Race
I'm taking part in a half marathon today
I will be running near Mt. Fuji
Fuji to run the race
It is raining here right now, but
I don't know if it will rain at the race venue
Well, However, I will be used to the new one soon
The highest temperature of the day is around 35 degrees Celsius everyday
It is dizzyingly hot
In the city, there is a heat island phenomena
A hot wind is blowing instead of the cozy cool wind."
Have you ever felt a loss of motivation after completing a big goal
It is weird that I don't think I can keep my motivation high after completing my goal of running my first ultra marathon two weeks ago. (Original sentence was a little awkward, so I've simplified it
I don't want to run as much as before
Perhaps I might have burnt-out or something like that
Have you ever felt yourself like this yourself
I have read a similar story in a book by Haruki Murakami
It might be because of the physical fatigue, including the visceral fatigue
The instinct (I don' think \"The instinct\" is appropriate here) This might force me to take a rest so my whole body can recover
Anyway, It was a very interesting experience. (If you are referring to the ultra-marathon was should be used. If you are referring to the experience of losing your motivation, continue to use is
I enjoy(ed) it. (Same note as above
I will take a good rest for some time so my body can recover and so that I can enjoy myself running again."
There is just a month left till (until) the end of this year
Time actually does fly
But they are no trouble, as they are planned for the purpose of saving electricity
We are Japanese, and Japan will recover soon
We live an almost normal life, except for the disaster area, the blackouts and suspension of trains in the northern half of Japan
We are proud of our strong spirit even in such a serious conditions
We have been strong so far, and we will remain strong for the future
We very much appreciate the support, charity and prayers you all have sent, and continue to send to Japan
We don't have enough words to thank you
So we enjoyed the reunion party by remembering and talking about good memories from those happy days
We all got older, but our friendship will have been always remain fresh and never fade away. 
We had a work last Saturday, so we have a rest day today in its place
To tell you the truth, some of the power cuts were canceled by reducing electricity consumption
I think we will have them until  at least the spring or the summer
We will have an irregular and stressful life cycle for a while to help Japan recover quickly
What we can do ourselves right now by each of is what we have to do right now for immediate to help Japan recover.."
Our company's president recently showed a new globalization plan for the employees
It was said that it would make us more global
We must study foreign languages, especially English, and get a business mind of the world's competition level
It was shown that we must take the TOEIC test and score more than 600 for a promotion
April Fools
Yesterday was April Fools' Day
Anyway, I still live honestly
What I mentioned above is not a lie, I am sure. "
It is a running event of 42.195km; long and easy run and to see some scenery
I have one today, but, unfortunately, it is now raining now, unfortunately
Take extra care for the road safety. 
On the way home, I was nearly run over by a car yesterday evening
I run to work and run back home from work almost everyday. (jog
In Yesterday evening, at a T-junction with a good view, not blind, I was running down straight along the road at an easy pace, A car approaching to the junction from left path ran though a stop sign at the junction intersection and nearly ran over me
I glared angrily at the female driver and went away to keep jogging who kept driving as if nothing had happened
She could not see me running because she was in a hurry to go back home for preparation of to prepare dinner or something, I don't know
At dusk, we can not see very well in getting as it gets darker outside
So we must take extra care when driving, walking and running outside to keep ourselves from being in getting into traffic accidents
I commute by train on rainy days
It takes more time than running to work on sunny days
I take two trains to my office, so I have to lose some time to change trains
While running to work, I listen to music with on my iPod; on the other hand, while taking the train, I read some books
I will go for it
I came back home late at night again yesterday. Yesterday, I came back home late at night again
I have a lot of problems to solve at work which happened in line, one after another
I believe it is a good chance for me to mature
Well I will charge myself up to solve the problems
The team belongs to the Kanagawa prefecture amateur senior soccer league
At the senior league, only players aged above 40 can play
At the annual meeting, we discussed last year's activities, including the game results and the budget and made plans for the coming year, while talking about old and new staff, ways of management, game tactics and so on
The meeting was held in a party room at an Izakaya for about an hour with no drinking. It was surprising for us
It was a very worthwhile meeting
And thereafter, we started partying and drank. 
It was great fun
We drank very much and enjoyed talking about our soccer and also something else
I wonder why athletes drink so much
At least many athletes whom I know of, do so."
I love electric fans in the summer season very much
I don't like the cold air from air conditioners very much
Electric fans blow us a nice breeze with more natural air
Electric fans are more comfortable than air conditioners, in my opinion
Of course, I have one turned on by my side right now
It is cloudy and is about to start raining
It's the rainy season in Japan
Electric fans do a great job and play great roles in this season and coming summer
However, the rainy season here in Kanagawa, Japan will be end finished in a few days
I think it will (end\/be) the next week
I love summer of course, but in this summer I am worrying about the electricity saving saving electricity
Less light is rather good, but less air conditioner conditioning is not good especially for weak people, for example, the old, the baby and the sick."
It's said that the good fortune will be gone if you speak
I spent time watching some dramas and movies recorded on the HDD recorder
I watched \"500 days of summer\" and \"Solanine\" which is a Japanese movie, and some other stuff, too. [←Casual expression. Here, it seems more natural
I had my hair cut after about two months, too. [あぁ、\"Besides\"=ネガティブな感じです。「Besides that,...」= neutral. Here,「Too・も」is better. 
I did not do any housework and refreshed myself by thoroughly lazy resting
I've probably completely refreshed myself now
These days, I have been returfing the lawn in the garden. Repairing is okay as well, however \"returfing\" is more exact because it specifically means applying new turf to the ground
It was a kind of cooler climate lawn for the autumn and winter seasons
I have been repairing it \/ returfing it with another kind of hotter climate lawn for the summer season
It grows much faster in this hot summer
I shall tell you how I repaired the lawn
Well, now I will get started
First, cut about 5 cm off the summer-kind blades, and second, put them into holes dug in the garden. (We usually say \"a blade of grass\" and not \"a straw of grass
And then, water the grass every afternoon
Several days later, almost all the blades will take root and grow
There's no need to pay more money
Why don't you try it? Or: Why don't you try also?"
It is a kind of fire festival to worship travelers' guardian deities which are called 'Doso-jin
It is held here and there in rural areas of Japan on the little New Year (January 15th or during 14th and 16th by the lunar calendar). -- \"little New Year\"? I haven't heard of that
We burn ”Kadomatsu” which are decorative pine branches; \"Shimekazari\" which is a sacred Shinto rope adorned with festoons, and \"Kakizome\" which are writings on paper for the New Year and so on, at the central fire. -- \"festoons\" isn't commonly used, and I would probably just use \"decorations\", although it's fine as-is. You can't use \"calligraphies\" as that's just writing and it doesn't make a plural, so I looked up \"Kakizome\" (interesting about how high the paper flies when you burn it, by the way
It is said that we can avoid disease if we eat rice cakes baked in the fire, and we can improve calligraphy skill if the fire rises high
Three consecutive days off in a row
Tomorrow is a national holiday in Japan. We call this holiday, Coming of Age Day. There is not really anything wrong with what you wrote but I made some changes to try to make it flow better and to make it more native-sounding
So we have three consecutive days off in a row. (consecutive = in a row
I am enjoying the days off rest days just after the beginning of the new year
I can't wait it
Difficulty of making timely corrections on journals
I think it is difficult to make corrections on others' journals in a timely manner
I want to make corrections and comments on journals to help others in their study of languages and (also) to make friends
Whenever I want to do so, someone has already made corrections on them
I don't think it is good to make the same corrections again, so I am sorry but I cannot make additional corrections
It's almost like a kind of competition
It is surely difficult to make an original and timely correction on someone's journal
Have you ever felt these difficulties as I have
It is based on the novel originally written by Kanae Minato
It's a revenge story about a junior high school teacher whose daughter was killed by his pupils
The story consists mainly of the confessions of some characters. (\"Consists mainly of...\" is the usual word order
She, who is a teacher, a mother and an avenger, plots revenge on the killers in a terrible, psychological way. (I don't think \"revenger\" is that common of a word. People usually use \"avenger
It was a horrible, unhappy story
No one came out happy, not even the avenger mother and the revenged killers (upon whom revenge was sought
One killer, who is a junior high school student, has his own story of why he killed a little girl
The other killer, who is a classmate of him, has another story
I don't recommend the movie to everyone \/ all peoples, especially not to parents who have school kids
However, it may make you wonder about whether or not the school life of your kids is okay. (I'm not quite sure if this is what you meant
You say that it was non-fiction, but add the words \"It was only a non-fiction story\", so I'm a bit confused as to whether you meant that it was actually a fictional story?? 
I hope a story like this one will not happen in the real world
Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie
Do you like movies of this kind?"
It was an excellent weather for running a marathon
Fuji which is now capped with snow, and the other mountains coloured various colours of the fall leaves. In Canada, England, Australia (and other Commonwealth countries), \"colours\" is spelt with a \"u\". However, the way you have it is also correct (American English
The 1st half of this race, I ran far but too fast
This caused me to slow speed down for the 2nd half
I got a stomach muscle spasm around the 25th kilometre
It was a little painful to run
I think it was the toughest one this year
What are you planning to do in this weekend
I will run a half marathon on the Fuji International Speedway on Sunday
I will run 4 and half laps at around the track but needless to say, I will be moving much more slowly than a racing car! entire course on the speedway. I added your next sentence here in order to avoid starting a new sentence with 'but
but needless to say, I will be moving much slower than a race ing car. needless to say
Congratulations to Spain
Spain beat Netherlands 1-0 in extra time
It was a very exciting game filled with many amazing plays at the highest of global level
I am looking forward to the next one even though the current one has only just finished."
I make it a rule to do some routines during the new year's holidays
On the first day, I ran to the top of a mountain nearby to see the first sunrise with friends
Then, I walked up to the temple to wish for a nice year with my family
On the second day, we visited my wife's parents for New Year's greeting
And we went to cheer at the Hakone Ekiden Relay Race
We also went to watch the High School Soccer Championship games at the stadium. Using \"and then\" is very repetitive
And then, we went shopping at Yokohama midtown
On the third day, I ran to cheer the Hakone Race again, but this time, alone
I have somewhat busy holidays
Note\/Write everything down in notebooks\/in a notebook
We always think of many things of various kinds various things. It is just simpler to use \"various things\" or \"many things
Coming up with good ideas, having a brainstorm alone brainstorming, thinking of a right words or phrases, and so on. I would try to fuse this sentence with the previous one. Example: We always think of various things such as coming up with good ideas, brainstorming or thinking of a the right word or phrase. To be honest, I would leave \"brainstorming\" out also because the activity of brainstorming is precisely thinking about ideas (making this a bit repetitious
And, iIt's a pity that we cannot keep all of them in our mind or that we cannot remember what good ideas we think thought up a just a while ago. Also possible: \"... what good ideas we came up with just a while ago
We would forget most things because our brains don't have infinite capacities to remember everything. Also possible: We forget most things because our brain doesn't have the infinite capacity to remember everything
Yes, it probably is. Or, at least for me, it certainly is
Don't you think it is would be good if we could remember every good ideas we had thought of? Also possible: Don't you think it would be good if we could remember every good idea we ever thought of
What should we do for to attain that? Or: How can we accomplish that
What we should do for that is to note everything down on notebooks
Bringing a notebook with us anytime anywhere at all times, we can note down anything you we see, hear and feel, and . We can also note down good ideas, even not good ideas bad ones - everything. Also possible: We can also note down ideas, good or not - in essence we can note down everything. 
Fortunately, notebooks are not so (can also replace \"so\" with \"very\") expensive, easy to get at stationary shops, convenience stores, and so on
 By itself, I don't really understand this sentence. However, I think that you have already conveyed the meaning of this phrase in the next two sentences
When we fill up a notebook, we can just use the next a new one
We can write everything on them and then we can forget everything we had noted down
That is a good idea, don't you think so?"
It is not easy to keep high concentration during the long time. OK. other optional phrases: to keep concentrated \/ to stay concentrated \/ to stay focused."
Half marathon run
I am going to run in a marathon race today
It is called \"Fuji Marathon Festa
There are many races in the \"Festa\". [what is a festa? a festival
I will take part in the half marathon race
I think I will enjoy it
I'm not ready to go out yet
I have to get ready now
I will tell you about the race later
It was nominated for an Oscar
Aliens have come to Earth and their spaceship is stranded above Johannesberg
The aliens were caught and isolated into District 9
One day, they forced moved from District 9 to another district
The person in charge of the alien transfer is not a soldier, but only a minor officer. (Technically he's a goverment office worker
He began to transfer the aliens from District 9 to another district
And then something bad happened to him
The rest is omitted so as not to reveal whole story
I enjoyed watching it
It was interesting
But I don't recommend you see it
It is not a happy movie and not for young children because of foul language. 
It has a variety of features; aliens, actions, splatter, robots, friendships, and so on
But unless you like these types of movies, I don't recommend you see it
Now opening is the sweetfish season
You can also use: They come from faraway early in the morning
This river is famous for sweetfish fishing
They fish by using a decoy in the center of the river and with the water at waist level with very long fishing rods
I had a bit of trouble understanding your sentence, so I tried correcting according to what I understood: The decoy fish are put into the territory of the targeted sweetfish, so that the targeted sweetfish will attack the decoy and be hooked. 
As much as I know, that is the way of fishing for sweetfish using a decoy
I have never fished for sweetfish with\/using a  decoy
Fishers with their very long rods in the river is a beautiful scenery in\/during the summer."
I went on an early morning run along my usual riverside course before leaving for a business trip
The road was still drying from recent rain and felt a little humid but comfortable
Today I will attend a lecture to get my fire-prevention supervisor license, and will become the new supervisor
I will be the supervisor
At first, I began running to lose weight
I think it's for something like self-development
And I was able to manage to complete it
I got that sense of completion
I was able to get a huge sense of completion
But at the same time, it was weird but I felt some sense of lacking
Many different alumni from 70s seniors to 19 years old new graduates went there
We all felt like we were living in our high school days again
It was Saturday yesterday. (or \"Yesterday was Saturday
Sunday is usually a holiday for my company. This is different in the US and UK. In the US a \"holiday\" is just a specific holiday like Christmas, Labor Day or St. Patrick's Day but not a weekend, vacation, or day off from work. In the UK they will say \"holiday\" to mean vacation or day off
But I had  to go to my office to do some an urgent job
I decided to run to holiday work
I made some a detour along the river and somewhere for about one and a half hours
I ran back home in the midday at noon
One of my daily workout is a strength training
I do this mainly to strengthen my body muscles but also to wake me myself up in the morning
I don't do this too hard
and use no extra weights such as dumbbells
Pushups on the toes for 30 repeats
How What do you think about my training menu 
I would say mine was half empty
I think time flies by fast
I want more time to do more of the things I have to do
Have a good time in your 2nd half
The other semi-final game of the World Cup is now being played by Germany and Spain
I am writing this post during half time
The Spanish team overwhelmed the German team in the first half
Speedy short passes and well-organized team plays were made by the Spanish team
Well, the second half has just begun
Do you think the coach's lucky blue sweater will work for the German team again?"
I saw\/spotted a shooting star this morning
To believe in  yourself. -To believe someone means to believe that what he\/she says is true. To believe in someone means to have confidence in his\/her abilities
To believe in your abilities\/capability... *Capability is not wrong, but is often in a phrase such as: her capability to lead. An ability is something that you can do and have done in the past. Capability usually refers to something that you can learn to do in the future
To believe you can get through the difficulty

Everyday I wake up early to study
I always get up at four on the weekdays and at five on the weekends
For being like that an early bird, I have to go to bed early at night to have a good sleeps
But unfortunately, I have been very busy at my job these days
I come back home from work around eleven in the at night
I can sleep only no more than five hours a day these days
That is why I am still very sleepy right now
Well, anyways, I have to prepare for a presentation in at the meeting next Tuesday
Whenever at a time like these, some troubles happen to us
We must pull together to get through this difficult situation
OK, all right, I'm awake now
I'll do my best today
Excursion with my son
My son and I took the same train to commute to work yesterday morning
I went to the head office of my company in central Tokyo for a business meeting
My son went to his university after getting off our train
There were not enough seats for both of us. There was only one
The train was getting crowded more and more  as it edged closer to central Tokyo
He got off at Shimokitazawa Station and transferred to his train to school
I also transferred to a different at the next station. The new train headed towards my compay's head office
It was only one event in our schedules that day
They were set in splintsso they don'tnot to fall down by the wind or anything
I am looking forward it growing up, getting blooming and fruiting.I am looking forward to seeing them grow and bloom."
The epicenter was close to the 311's one. I am not sure where \"311\" is. 
Here, the quake also had an intensity of about intensity 3
I don't know of any the damages caused by it
Now we are in the rainy season in Japan according to the calendar
However, we have had no rain after that. since then
Someone Some are glad to have less rain, but others are not glad
I am afraid if that water shortage may be serious in this summer
We will especially have to conserve electricity in this summer
Less electricity, less water, and heat in summer will burden us
The first day of autumn
Yesterday was the first day of the beginning of autumn according to the calendar
The breeze in the early morning and the evening feels cooler little by little, day by day, even if it is still very hot at midday
We can sleep better at the night than a week ago
I feel a little  sad that summer is going
We have a game in the local league
We are sure to be incredible enthusiast of running. We sure are incredible enthusiast of running."
It is rather cool in this morning
Do you have any plans
I will go for on a two-day trip to Kyoto with my family in during the first week on of August
I wonder how long it has been since the our last our family trip
After two days of unexpected, but good rest, I enjoyed this commute run
We can't expect better weather.More colloquially: We couldn't hope for better weather
But the pollen are now attacking me on my nose.rephrased: The pollen is making my nose run
The next time I ran was at lunchtime
I was sorry I ran with my itchy and runny nose, but it was during the excellent warm spring daytime. It is strange to say that you are \"sorry\" unless you are apologizing for something or to someone directly
I didn't want to go back to the office
And the third time I ran was when I ran took a long detour from work back home
Yesterday was the no overtime day at my office
So I left my office out as soon as possible to run to see the cherry blossoms at dusk
We have spent a long time very happily together
It's hard for me to say to my wife that I love her, but I do love her.(Just a bit more natural this way
Some years ago, she completely forgot that today was our anniversary day.(Because you have said 'some years ago', you can then say 'today' and mean 'this day, some years ago
I love that side of her, too
I found two big male Japanese pheasants on the riverbank path on the way to work yesterday
They looked about two feet long from head to tail. (Often when talking about amounts, you include \"long,\" \"tall,\" etc. For example: \"The river is 20 feet wide,\" \"I am 6 feet tall,\" \"He is 60 years old\/young,\" etc
They had beautiful red heads and long tails
There are many kinds of wild birds around the riverbank on which I run as a home course. (? Not sure what you mean by \"home course
Different kinds of herons, geese, and so on; I don't know their names
I enjoy watching them while running."
As you know, a lack of sleep and some alcohol makes one oversleep. 
This was my first time in this year
They are a sign of the early summer in Japan
They can live in clean water, so we have be careful not to pollute rivers in order to protect the fireflies. preserve them
Anyway, another topics, I got some spam friend invitations these days
Do you
During the next weekend, I will run a 24 hour relay race
My first run to my recently moved new office (I would say new instead of \"recently moved\" but yours made sense
I commuted by running to and from the newly located office yesterday
It was the first run my first time running to the new location. (sounds more natural
It is a little shorter than my old run (from my old office) ever
Well, at least it should have been
The former one included a nice riverside cycling road, but the new one consists mainly of streets and sidewalks (urban views) by them
The streets have a lot of cars during the morning commute time, and the sidewalks are too narrow to enjoy running on them (or too narrow for a good run
I also enjoyed seasonal sceneries on how scenic the former riverside cycling road was, and I can't enjoy them scenery on the new route
It is really not so fun\/enjoyable
Especially in the fresh\/early morning
Or I will get used to it
So I should search for better routes asap
I think it will be fun to explore some better routes as well."
Congrats on the advance to the final
The Japanese players played quick and tough throughout the whole game
Their body shapes were smaller than the Swedish players, but they were never inferior in the physical sense
And their shots were highly accurate
It seemed There were no was nowhere to step in his room before yesterday. (You don't have to say \"it seemed\" if you know for a fact there was nowhere to step
He finally decided to clean his room
There is almost nothing remaining on the floor
Where did they go
There are not as many dust bags. Where did they go
It seem like the mess went into the closet, drawers or shelves, probably
I asked myself, how was this holiday
And I reply iIt was very good, of course
I managed to could complete my first 112km ultra marathon, went cycling with my wife, spent much time with my family, read some novels, did some houseworks, and refreshed myself well
The busy days will be back to me.>>Back to the grind
I will fly to Singapore tomorrow for a business trip
Therefore when I heard the good news, I am lucky that the typhoon will have gone by tomorrow, I felt relieved
It sped up faster than forecasted
So the flight for my Singapore trip will be able to fly as usual tomorrow
I hope all goes well."
I've got a secret and it's that I've still got a bit of a hangover right now
At last, The replacement watch arrived to me on Feb.1st
I sent the faulty watch for replacement on last December
That was 3months ago
I sent inquiry emails to him every week, in each of his emails he replied that he had already shipped the replacement , but it had not arrived
But, actually, the shipping date written down on the delivery record sheet is
I forgive him, because the watch is here on my rist now."
Fuji is now capped with snow as like shown in my profile photo
I feel the winter is here just  by seeing it."
I begin began the morning with a banana diet from yesterday to lose weight
I want to lose about 3kg of weight until the for the Arakawa Marathon on March 21th

I am writing you because we would like to study about open innovation in Singapore
We will conduct reseach for about one year, and our goal is to create a similar proposal for Japanese open innovation

I received an e-mail\/a letter a mail from my friend yesterday
She said her daughter is getting married next March in the mail
It was a very good news and pleased me
I thought it was a coincidence that the two marriages will take place around the same time
By the way, my brother isn't going to marry my friend's daughter.haha, I did wonder :D
Suspicious disallowed goal
That happened yesterday during the game between Germany and England
The ball shot by a striker hit the crossbar and bounced into the goal once and then bounced back outside to the goal keeper
However, the referee didn't see the goal
Referees at the world level seldom make a mistake, but unfortunately, it still happens
It makes things interesting and exciting
Interestingly, in a game in 1966 between the same two countries, the referee disallowed a legitimate goal
This has been called a \"suspicious goal
The play with with the disallowed goal from yesterday's game will be called a \"suspicious non-goal\", from now on,  I think
One of my friends is now trying to run 100 marathons on every single day for 100 days
We, his friends, are supporting for his great challenge
We will organize a marathon races everyday for 100 days
He ran his 85th marathon yesterday
Some very exciting plays were made during the 1st half of the match
These plays were very speedy and powerful
The splendid goals were shot scored by Netherlands
and Uruguay, respectively
Soon the 2nd half will be kicked off."
Masters of marathon's remark \/ comment
Please refer to my journal for information about the mara-nic;  
It was tough, but very enjoyable
The members of the Club have ran marathons for more than 100 times
Don't you think that is awesome
They said they run marathons every weekend
They really are masters of marathon, aren't they
One of the masters said to me yesterday, \"It feels tough to run marathon if you run once in a while, but you could get used to it if you run do it every week.\" The other master agreed and said, \"Yes, sure
You could get used to it as well, like how we all got used to it
Mistake
I got an e-mail
The e-mail said the description for an item I sold in an internet auction was not correct
I said it was made by one manufacturer, but it was actually made by another
It seems that) I have made a mistake. (or: \"(It looks like) I must have made a mistake.\" or \"(If I am to believe that person then) I made a mistake.\" 
I proposed to him that he return it for a refund
I feel some stressed these days
I have to refresh myself [better to say 're-energize'] by doing something different
Do you have any good ideas for refreshing [better to say 'Do you have any good tips to help me feel re-energized
Before anything else, I will enjoy this weekend. (Your original sentence is grammatical but this is more natural
Playing badminton in the gym in the hot summer seemed very tough and probably caused the players, including my daughter, some physical and possibly mental damage. Caused by summer fatigue
We are worrying about her
We started at the Japan National Stadium, ran around Shinjuku then back to the stadium to finish
It was fun and very exciting
Some masquerade runners also participated
Anime characters like Pikachu and Gatcaman, a zebra, a swan, a businessman, a schoolgirl, and so on
They were so funny
The marathon race had been exciting 
I ran a marathon race yesterday. (\"Had\" is not incorrect, it's just that in this case, you can use a verb that is even more precise
I made a mistake in setting the alarm last night
So\/Therefore, I had to rush to the starting site
Without any magic supplements, any nutritious foods nor any warming up and stretching before the start, I started running the race
In the beginning, I ran at an even slow pace, and gradually sped up to an easy chattable pace
A comfortable and beautiful Fall day; I felt very good
After around 35km, both sides of my outer hips felt sore and my body felt heavier
I managed to keep my pace to the last ( ). To the last...? To the last second? \"Last\" here is an adjective, but you need to put a noun to describe it is to the last what
And in the last kilometer, I escorted a visually impaired runner. When using a time or distance expression that is equal to \"1\", it it not necessary to put the \"1\" in front. Eg. The last minute, the last second, the last meter, the last km. People do not usually say, \"the last 1 minute\", \"the last 1 meter\", etc
It was my first time as an escort runner
We have a are having trouble with the wireless LAN at our home
We can't print documents with one PC via the wireless LAN on the printer which is connected wirelessly
With another PC or Mac, we can print documents correctly
So only one certain PC has this problem
I am the administrator of the home network, I have to fix the problem
The problem may be at the level of the network settings of the printer or the PC
I am sure I will be able to fix it."

I got back home from the reception for the Challenge Fuji 5 Lakes Ultra Marathon which is tomorrow. 
I got my number tags, which is #1570. Or simply: My tag is #1570. Or: The tag which I got is #1570
I will have a short sleep and then drive there by at 3 am. Usually, when you use \"by\" for a time expression, it means that we have to be somewhere by a certain time. Eg. \"I have to be at the marathon starting site by 3 am
I am too excited to get go to sleep..."
It is held at in the Shonan area in Kanagawa, Japan
About 20 thousands runners participate in it
I have done that, too
And third, to run a distance of 42.195 km 100 times during the year
Thank you very much for your encouragements!"
I am very sorry to complain at this time
I am not a kind of complainers
Just this once
By the way, it is about my working environment
I don't like it very much; I'll even say I almost can't put up with it
There are many unpleasant noises and smells from my coworkers
My neighbor on the left always makes loud noises chewing his gum
One on my right isconstantly murmuring to himself
The one behind me has a broken computer fan rotating at maximum speed that constantly makes a loud noise. (\"One on my behind\" evokes the image of someone sitting on the backside of your body
And the one next to the onebehind me wears a lot of perfume
It's not such a bad fragrance, but it's far too strong. 
These distractionsprevent me from concentrating on my work at my desk
I work on my computer on my desk, so I can't escape to another place, for example, to a library or a meeting room
I wear earplugs all day long to concentrate on my work
I wonder what I can do to improve my work environment
I am making a plan to either change it or escape from there
How are you going doing in this summer
It's another hot and humid morning here
But it's Sunday. <--Because this starts with \"but,\" it is not a full sentence. It needs to be linked to the sentence before it with a comma
What are your plans for today?"
There are some representative offices of foreign institutes, such as scientific technology research centers
I had a chances to visit some of them in this summer
The day before yesterday, we visited to the representation office of that from Finland
And today, we will visit to the office from Germany
We are studying about R&D and business strategies, so we visit to hear about their strategies of the institutes abroad
We could heard very interesting talk the day before yesterday from Finland
We look forward to visiting Germany's office in Japan today
We can rarely get chances to go to such places
They It seem something like I'm traveling abroad in Japan."
10 days have already passed since December has started
I was sure to get a lot of things done
For example, The 100 straight days of running, a 100km ultramarathon, a 24 hour relay, a transfer at work, the work as a R&D theme leader, and so on

Yesterday was the Father's Day
Did you call your father, if you are living far apart from him
Did you say thanks to him
My daughter bought me a chou a la creme to show with her gratitude
My son showed me his appreciation by saying thanks to me. You can simplify the prepositional phrase to \"by thanking me
I also made a phone call to say thank you to my dad. Technically correct, but awkward. Try \"I also called my dad to thank him
My parents are living in Hiroshima by themselves.alone

He said he was glad to have received a phone call from me.be called
I wished his him good health

I will tell you about a smallthing that happened to me 
We are representative of several companies and  have been gathering discuss business issues approximately once a month since this spring in this fiscal year
After the meeting, we had a dinner and a had  frank talk so we could make friends with each other
When one of the members and I talked about our home town, I found out something surprising
His wife and her sister were the alumnus of my high school and the sister might have been in the same grade as mein school
It was a surprising coincidence
We are now 1000km far away from our home town
and he and I had met only five times or so. *I joined the two sentences with a comma, for a more natural flow

Do you know of the \"White Day\"?Have you heard of \"White Day
Have you heard it
On Valentine's Day, females give chocolates to males as a symbol of their  love or appreciation. 
And I think it is weird that turned to be obligation these days. how that has turned into an obligation
Honmei-choco\" means \"chocolate of love
Giri-choco\" means \"obligation chocolates
On the \"White Day\", males who luckily received chocolates return their guys who were lucky enough to get chocolates return the favor by giving gifts, and sweets like cookies, candies, etc
even if he received It doesn't matter if he got \"Honmei-choco\" or \"Giri-choco
I'm not sure, but there wasn't the White Day in my childhood but I don't think there was a \"White Day\" when I was young
We Japanese love interesting events or ceremonies like this, so the White Day got popular immediately
As for me
I have received many chocolates from many females, of course, from my wife, daughter, many female friends, and coworkers
I have to give them lots of nice sweets with my love
Since Valentine's Day was on Sunday and due to recent slow economy, a lot less obligation chocolates were sold
By the way, today March 14th is my 43rd birthday

It is a little farther from my house than the former place\/location
There It's a longer distance from my house, it is by about 4 km, than the former(first) one, it which was about 2.6 km
I am wondering(thinking about) how to I'll commute every day
When I can it is fine, I run to office as like I did before, so that's still good
Otherwise when I can't it is not fine, like when there's the heavy rain or snow for example, which it's better to take the train or (to) walk to the office
Both of them They both take about the same amount of time
I must have to apply for a commuting pass, so I'll have to must decide how I'm going to commute soon
One Day on a Business Trip
I went on a business trip to Shiga
I took the super express Hikari at Odawara, changed to Nozomi at Nagoya, changed to a normal train at Kyoto, and at last, arrived at Katata in Shiga, nearby Biwa Lake, which is the largest lake in Japan
It was rather shorter than expected
I had a business meeting in Katata

and I took overtook about 10 runners but I'm not exactly sure
So we came 25th place out of over 240 teams
However, unfortunately, It was cloudy yesterday so we couldn't enjoy the beautiful perspectives scenery while running
I was not in very good physical condition from a recent busy work day, at least not in peak condition for challenging for my previous private record. 
Ttherefore I had decided to run at my fun-run pace
Actually at the race, I ran a bit little faster than the fun-run pace, because my physical and also mental condition got better and better (improved) while running
This was just the FUN-RUN for refreshing ourselves
Appropriate physical exercise at nice duration and nice load road could refresh ourselves, I believe
Anyway, I could enjoyed the fun-run race yesterday. Do not switch from present to past tense

It was a tough camp with concentrated discussions all day long from early in the morning until midnight and since
I came home around five. am or pm

I took a seminar about leadership
The thought leads us to be able to do anything well
Positive thought leads us to succeed, while negative thought leads us to failure
I use time in the morning to study the morning time to study
I make it a habit to study early in the morning
I have continued this habit for more than two years now
I'm sure it is because the rhythm of life sometimes shifts by staying at work late, stress or other things like that. overstays, stresses or something like that
From another point of view, sleeping in the oversleep may be good for some rest
I will make it a little easier and not so strict
Have you ever heard the word \"Mara-nic
It is made of these two words: \"marathon\" and \"picnic
It means, as you suppose, a picnic combined with a \/ after a 42.195km marathon distance run
Even slower than a normal jog, 7-8min a kilometer or more, I'm not sure
We each take a backpack or a waist bag to carry a bottled water, a camera, a towel, some chocolates, candies, energy gels, and so on, as same as regular picnics
Have you ever heard of Enoshima
It is very popular because it is a symbol of the Shonan area
There are a beautiful sea, beautiful beach, and rows of pine trees
The famous pop group Southern All Stars sings in the Enoshima and Shonan area, some famous movies were shot taken there also
Found spring in the garden
We have cold days here in these days.(or \"The days are still cold here

I send mail to the members regarding game schedules, game participants and any other information
I ask if they are going to be present or absent before every game and I let them know the summary. What do you mean by \"summary
It is more work than I expected
So I decided to make communication with the members easier by utilizing an online mailing list
Have you ever heard of an online mailing list? When you want to say something like 「～を知っていますか？」 It is more natural to say \"Have you ever heard of~\" instead of the literal translation:\"Do you know
You can easily e-mail all of the members at once using it
I think it will be very useful
The only problem is that it is very difficult for me to persuade my seniors to sign up for the mailing list
By now, about two thirds of the members have joined our mailing list
I have to get all of the members to join our mailing list as soon as I can."
I will introduce some phrases to ease anyone, including myself, who are suffering from the stresses of every day life. 
I read them in some books recently. 
Don't be egoistical
Don't think that you always have to be in first place. 
Consider something from your partner's point of view and his values
Answer or respond after one breath
Don't be overly defensive. 
Forgive yourself as much as you forgive other people. (I'm not sure if this is what you are trying to say
Set yourself up for success. (I don't know what you are trying to say, so I just guessed
What do you think of these phrases?"
Outbid on eBay
I sometimes enjoy auctioning on eBay
Sometimes I bid on some items, but I rarely win them
It is because my bids are not high enough, therefore they are always outbid
So far, I have won some old cameras and some old wrist watches on eBay with very reasonable prices respectively
I was lucky that time
Browsing on eBay is very interesting, do you agree
Today, we will have our a power cut in the afternoon
We have a long holidays called Golden Week in Japan
If we also take added some paid holidays, we can have a long holidays from today to next next Monday
This is as long as the summer holidays or new year's one
What shall I do in these holidays
Some runs, riding bikes, spending time with family, and taking rests time out for relaxing
Have good holidays everyone, especially those of you in the northern Japan
I hope this from the bottom of my heart
The import tax for leather shoes is very expensive in Japan
It said that the item cost $35 for the item, shipping was $40 for the shipping, and approximately $50 was for the import tax and something, approximately
Don't you think the import tax is too high expensive
The import tax of leather shoes is the higher one between either $50 or 30% of the price of the item including the shipping, whichever is higher
This make me think it is better to buy shoes for $100 in Japan than to buy at a reasonable price like this on eBay
A New Week Starts
Today is Monday
I wonder what I should do until the end of the year
We all have something left to do in this year, don't we
Cleaning the house, writing new year cards, and some other houseworks like that

I love running, but I wonder how they will do
We had the annual relay race yesterday
It is one of the events held by our company
The race is held right after our office closes for the day
However, unfortunately there was some serious trouble that took place at my work in the days leading up to the relay race day
They were all serious and urgent problems, so I had to deal with them immediately
I combined this with the sentence above
It needed to be done
I thought I should not waste time by running the race, but should bury myself in my work
I was disappointed that I couldn't run the race and that my team had to forfeit because of it
It was a very nice race which has a good history behind it
Yesterday's race was the 45th
It has a very good course with nice scenery, nice warm audiences and excellent staffs

When I was 18, I lived by myself in Tokyo apart, away from my parents
That is not why [You need to specify what \"That\" refers to here - it's not quite clear] but I rarely go went shopping with my parents
I didn't spentd much time with them those days
I wish I had done so more
If then I had done, my parents would have probably felt more happy happier, eh? [you should avoid using \"eh\" when writing anything formal
Anyhow, my family, including my 15 year old daughter, are very close and happy
We have to should be nice to our parents and family
This \"mara-nic\" is made with a combination of a marathon and picnic
It was a 42.195km distance marathon of picnic. *(?) Not sure, a picnic is usually when you go out to a park or something and just sit down, relax, and eat. I'm not sure how you can do a picnic and run a marathon at the same time! 
It is mid-summer now, so it was very, very hot yesterday
We could not run but walk due to the heat. *Because of the heat, we couldn't run so we walked. More natural

The Frostbite Road Race was held yesterday at the Yokota Air Base in Kanagawa, Japan
It was their 29th annual race
It was hosted by the Yokota Striders Running Club
The races took place at the US Air Force base, mainly on the road around the runways and near the residences nearby. 
I ran the half marathon race
It was sunny and there was only mild wind so it was not as cold as last year's
Many American family members at the base cheered us on by shouting, mostly in Japanese, \"Ganbare!\" and\"Ganbatte!\". I was happy to hear them cheering us on
I renewed my record
I was a little faster this year than last year
BTW, how do you say \"Ganbare!\" in English
Good job!\", \"Nice running\", \"Go on!\", ..., they said more but I am sorry I can't remember it any more
It takes not more than 2 hours total to go\/get to my\/the office. ['get' sounds a little more natural to me, but 'go' is okay, too. :)

They say like this... 
The Slow and steady wins the race

I am now facing a trouble withor something concerning about an internet shopping from overseas
I bought a vintage diver watch from an eBay sellerfrom overseas last October
The watchwas made around 1980
It is so massive and cool that I love it very much at a first sight
I emailed the seller to replace it or repair itusing my English with difficulty
But now, in the beginning of January, I didn't receive the replacement yet
I sent some emails to lethim know some information
By the way, I am enjoying this transaction because this is a good chance to study English communicationin a special situation
My parents live in Hiroshima which is about 1000 km apart from here (where I live), so we can't meet all that often
My son will start living alone (by himself) next summer
I will understand my father's feelings when I live apart from my son
My son failed to take the last train (home) after drinking last night and could not come back home
So he is staying in some other town right now
Maybe he is staying at an overnight cafe there
I'm sure\/Surely\/ he feels cold
He will get back home by taking the first train which runs soon
I overslept again this morning 
It is probably because of a lack of sleep these days
Besides, I love the comfortably warm bed more during a cold Winter
I came back home around midnight after working a long overtime shift last night
There are many things to do before summer holidays, as you may know."
Therefore I had better go should have gone to bed early last night, I knew it, of course, but I didn't want to do it so and I woke up late  last night
I still feel sleepy until now."
Our height, weight, and body fat rate were measured
We took allkinds of tests, such as a blood test, urine test, chest X-ray, eyesight, hearing ability, ECG, ultrasonic echo, and so on
We were not allowed to eat or drink anything, even water, till 9 pm the day before the check
We were very hungry by the end
My eyes welled with tears up while drinking the sweet coke after the check-up
A New Week has started
Another new week has started
It's been raining for three days straight. still raining for straight three days
I don't like the this rainy season before summer in Japan
It is humid and cold some days, and and some days its hot the other days
We have to take care of ourselves so we do not to catch a cold
By the way, I have to make\/write three reports today
Each one of them is very heavy(we wouldn't usually say \"heavy\" here...what did you want to say?) for me
I am going to do my best. make my best efforts for them."
Well, anyway, today I will write about something nice that happened last night
I ran to and from work, a distance of about 5 kilometers, through the residential area, the paddy field and by the river
Ajisai, which is the Japanese name for hydrangea, had started  to bloom near the sidewalk
The paddy fields were filled with water and people were planting rice
It was such nice scenery
I loved it
Furthermore, last night I found a firefly flying by the riverside where I was running
I  think it followed  me for a while
It sounds very romantic, doesn't it
It was a destined meeting\/date or something like that
Ajisai and fireflies are the symbols of this season
They are only seen in the rainy season in Japan, and only in rural areas
Hurray, how nice it is to live  in a rural area!"
I have a big good\/great news
The results of the drawing for the tickets for the 2011 Tokyo Marathon 2011 were announced yesterday
It is very lucky that I won a ticket by lot! [or 'I'm very lucky
More than a million people applied for to be one of 30,000 lucky runners. [or 'applied for 30,000 tickets
It is a very real platinum ticket
I didn't win it last year
I am looking forward to running the Tokyo Marathon
Why do we so easily hurt the person whom we love the most on the Earth
We don't want to on purpose, of course, but we hurt them by making the same mistake again and again
We feel sorry, unhappy, unpleasant, regretful whenever we hurt them, and we always swear we won't do it again
But it is not easy for us to not do it again
 no, why do I myself 
We love Sakura, cherry blossoms (Sakura
They blooms in the spring for only about one week or so
When blooming, the cherry trees don't have their leaves, just many little flowers with five cute white-pink five petals
We enjoy seeing sakura (Hanami
The Washington's cherry trees are popular, aren't they
After full blooming, cherry blossom petals will fall in the wind
In a moderate wind, they fly into the air one after one another. lightly (fleetingly?), I think it is a scene of Japanese Wabi-Sabi
In a strong wind, the many petals falls simultaneously
Thousands or millions of petals fly into the air all together.(\"Thousands and thousands of petals fly into the air
It is so gorgeous that you would forget to breathe
I could not didn't have enough time to post a journal to Lang-8
It was very much hot yesterday
It was record temperature for hot weather in June
Many people were assailed (?) by the heat
We should take care not to get dehydrated in this season."
The quake felt like it kept shaking for more than OO minutes. More than OO minutes (you need a number
The floor swayed side to side
We felt afraid
Its epicentre was northern Shizuoka, which is under Mt
It's very close to here
Fortunately, I had already come home and was with my family, and we all were safe
We have to be careful of aftershocks."
We have a relay race at our factory's site after work tomorrow
It is the 61st annual race
Each team is made up of 4 runners and each runner runs about two to three kilometers respectively
Many people seem to have been looking forward to the race as is the case every year
Anyway, I think that I love running and I think that others also do."
I have a question
Would you please tell me how to say to complement someone
My friendtold me, \"You're beast
Am I wild as a beast
I think I am sure to be smart and handsome doesn't need to be labeled \"beast
I thought I would score higher on this one than I did on the last one
I was sure I would
However, unfortunately, the score I got was not as good as I had expected
So, I was a little disappointed
Not only was it worse than the last one I took but also the one before that
My scored dropped two straight times
I had problems with the listening test
Well, anyway, I won't let this get me down, in fact, it motivates me to study even harder
I will study hard and I WILL get a higher score on the next test!!"
It is a relay race where each runner runs on the road for long distances usually
Ekiden relay races are very popular in Japan
University students run relaying from Tokyo to Hakone and run relaying back to Tokyo
Well, going on to my race on Sunday, Six runners in a team will be running. (Since you already mentioned that it is a relay race, what you mean is quite clear and does not need further clarification
That is a very steep downward course
I am wondering if my legs will be able to withstand it. (Use the present tense, as you have not done the race yet and you are still worrying about it
My thighs have been feeling somewhat sore after (?) the last race last Sunday, but they got better now
I hope I will be ready by Sunday
Please cheer for me and my relay team!"
I could not sign up for the half marathon
It was already full and closed when I signed up
I will enjoyed the 10km at Shinjuku, which is the center of Tokyo, you know."
I joined a technology and business committee this fiscal year
It consists of members from various companies like mine
We will discuss the environmental technology and its business and so on throughout a year
We will have the first meeting this afternoon
Its magnitude was about M7
Many people died, and many were injured
Also many buildings collapsed
I hope they can be rehabilitated as soon as possible
There had been was also a very big earthquake in Kobe, Japan on Jan.17th, 1995
It happened 15 years ago today
It was called \"The Great Hanshin earthquake\" or \"Hanshin-Awaji Dai Shinsai\" in Japan
Its magnitude was M7.3
People and buildings in the area had been were badly damaged
We should prepare for coming future earthquakes, especially in Japan because it is a country that has frequent earthquakes."
The rainy season is likely to come here soon in Kanagawa, Japan
There is The front line is on the Pacific Ocean near Japan, (need a comma before 'and' when putting two complete sentences together) and we had some rain these past few days
I didn't bring a big umbrella yesterday, but I had a small folding one yesterday. 
I should have brought a big one
I don't like folding umbrellas very much, because they are inconvenient to carry when they are wet and folded, even if they are portable when they are dry
I don't like bringing a big one, either
I sometimes leave them in the train or in other places, so I feel nervous whenever I bring one."
Summer has already come, hasn't it?  
I suggest combining this sentence with the one above. Like: It feels very early, but the highest temperature of the day here recently is above 20 degrees Celsius. You can also use something like \"... the highest temperature recorded here recently
By the way, I am surprised to see that the chocolate bars which I keep in my desk for a snack (or \"for snacking\") are a bit soften and sticky these days
They are not good while being sticky, aren't they
They lose their crunchy and crispy taste
They stick to our fingers and then transfer to documents, desk, clothings, or whatever we touch with dirty fingers in the summer time. You can also use \"during the summer time
I think it's probably preferable to use \"It would be a disaster to stain important documents with chocolate.\" since... that's probably the case, isn't it 
I suggest \"They may even make stains on our white shirts
That would probably be a serious matter too
That is why I keep coated chocolate balls or something else for my snack instead of chocolate bars during summer days
Pay good attention to your chocolates in the summer, everyone! Or, \"during summer\""
Early bird can catch the worms.The English phrase goes \"The early bird gets the worm
I get up at 4 o'clock on weekdays and at 6 on the weekend
I am studying English with some textbooks and internet sites for studying English like Lang-8
I think it's better to study early in the morning, because it is so quiet and I can concentrate
What do you think about it
Sunscreen attacked my eyes
My eyes hurt as posted yesterday.My eyes have hurt since yesterday
I wondered if that was really a case that a sunburn caused this inflammation as I posted.I wonder if the inflammation was really caused by a sunburn
That's because I was used to spent more time under sun than yesterday without eye trouble like this.I am usedto spending more time outside under the sun without any eye trouble
Well then, what caused this inflammation of my eyes, I wonder.I wonder what actually caused the inflammation in my eyes
I put on some sunscreen on my face before getting out.I usually put sunscreen on my face before going out. 
And after getting out, I sweated a lot like a river and got sweat in my eyes.After I got out, I had sweat a lot and the sweat ran into my eyes
The sunscreen flew into my eyes with this sweat.Sunscreen mixed in with the sweat and got in my eyes as well. 
It hurted my eyes.My eyes were hurting
That's why my eyes became red and inflamed, I guess.I guess that is why my eyes are now red and inflammed
The sunscreen attacked my eyes, I'm sure. I'm sure The sunscreen attacked my eyes
I rarely put on sunscreen before now.Before this incident, I rarely applied sunscreen
I didn't know how it hurts my eyes.I did not know that it would hurt my eyes
Well, I learned.I've learned my lesson
I am not going to put sunscreen above my eyes."
It is still very hot, burningly hot, in the daytime, but it gets cooler in the morning and the evening these days day by day
Yesterday evening, on the way home from work, I heard the sound of drums. [good
I'm sure it was of the practicing of traditional drums for the fall harvest festivals
Boys and girls play the drums and their master plays the flute at the local fall harvest festivals
They are very good at playing the drums because they have practiced each year since they are were small children
We have done this for a long, long time
I guess there are the same or similar customs also in all another countries
How about in yours?"
Before there were notifications that my journal got comments or corrections before
However, not in these days
How is yours
We had a milestone progress meeting yesterday
We reported current situation of our work progress to the higher-ups decision makers including the president of our laboratory laboratory head and the representative of the enterprise division
Unfortunately, Our development doesn't go very well. our project isn't going too well
We have to slip revise our schedule
But we got approval to extend the deadline and do further research. for further investigation and our renewal plan
I have sore muscles all over of all my body now
Both thighs, calves, back, and abdominal muscles feel considerably sore
Especially when stepping down stairs, both my both thighs give a scream of pain
Should I take some rest for a while
I agree with this
But I think the active rest is more effective than the passive rest that just involves with staying still or doing nothing
The tree-planting ceremony was held near where I live
It was a very big ceremony there
because the Emperor and Empress came to plant trees by themselves
There are many roads that had been repaired, re-paved or newly made around and towards the park where the ceremony was held, to prepare for the ceremony. 
The Emperor and Empress planted seeds and various kinds of tree saplings, including pollen-less cedars
It was pity that it rained all the time during the ceremony, but many other attractions were there, like some dances, reading some essays, etc
We wish the trees will grow up healthily, and that we will keep the mountains and nature beautiful
A lot of books are piled up on it now
I have thought that I have to clean for months.>> I have been meaning to clean it for months
Most books which sometimes I may read again sometime should be there but it is is it really true
Books which I haven't read for a long time don't have to be there, at the prime location
I will clean them up next weekend."
He will graduate from the high school after finishing 3 years of study there
he will have had a great time there
We are very glad about\/for that
The graduation ceremony in Japan are like this
The graduates get some congratulatory speeches, their representative of them give theanaddress in reply,each one of them get a diploma from the principal, and then all attendants sing songs
Some days there are rain and some days it shines (or is sunny
Before The summer is coming and it is getting hotter and more humid day by day
For example, I sweat a lot, like a water fall, while jogging yesterday
We have to take enough water, salt and electrolytes so we don't get dehydrated even in mid summer
Besides, we have to get used to the heat and humidity gradually for the oncoming hot weather of the summer
We have to probably restrict electricity consumption this summer
We are worried about the short amount of electricity for air-conditioning in this summer."
Well, yesBut, I will tomorrow."
How long is your commute
How long is your commute
I run to work which takes about 30 minutes almost every day
My wife rides her bicycle to work which takes approximately 10 minutes
My daughter takes the train and then bikes to her school from the station which takes about 45 minutes
My son goes to a university which takes approximately an hour and a half by train
An hour and a half
Three hours in a train per day, every day
I can't say \"not too bad\" to that
We would like him to live alone in an apartment near his university or in a dormitory in the near future
If he lives alone, he must do his own housework
It takes time, but hope it takes less than 3 hours a day
He will learn a lot from this experience
For not wasting his time, or not losing kinds of opportunities, we'd better to let him live alone probably. It's better for him to live alone because it will save him time and he will have more opportunities. 
If he remains home, he can concentrate on his studies without worrying about housework
It would be better from one point of view
This is a difficult problem for us. Should he commute or live alone
We need time to decide what we will do."
Summer Greetings
We Japanese have a custom to send postcards for Summer Greetings
But I think handwritten postcards or letters would be much more appreciated by recipient
I think it is difficult to write letters to someone when we have no news to tell them, but is easier to write Season Greetings
Why don't you send handwritten Summer Greeting Cards to someone sometimes
In Japan, this weekend is a three-day weekend due to the holiday
Unfortunately, I have to go to the office on the holiday and work. \"I am very sorry\" is used to apologize profusely to someone else. It is like どうもすみません 
The end of the 1st period of the fiscal year is coming soon
Anyway, it's too beautiful outside for me to jump right into holiday work
I could not help but take a detour before heading to the office
So, I enjoyed running in the fresh, clean air before work
Well, It's time to get down to work. You can either say \"get down to business\", or \"get to work
We ran from Hiratsuka Sougo Koen Park to Enoshima and back instead of
It was instead of the usual many laps route in the Hiratsuka Sougo Koen Park
The route was flat enough for easy running but somewhat lacked of changes in the scenery (or but was somewhat boring\/monotonous), I thought
It was not very hot because of it was cloudy and sometimes we had a little rain
I ran at an easy not race pace
It was\/I had a lot of fun
We spent for three hours from 7 to 10 pm without any electric lights
It got colder without any stoves. While I understand what you mean (i.e. in Japan, heaters are called stoves), in general, we refer to ストーブ as \"heater\" or \"heaters
When the electricity came back at 10 pm, we realized its preciousness."
I found two fireflies flying on the way home from work yesterday
They were about 5km apart from each other
Hooray for my countryside
I used to go out to see fireflies near our previous apartment before moving here to our current place
There was a nice stream for fireflies and we protected them,  so we could see a lot of fireflies there
I'm sure you would love it."
Slight change of the life rhythm \"Life rhythm\" is an interesting phrase, but not one we use. Perhaps 'rhythm of life' or 'daily rhythm' or 'daily routine' would be better
Even a small change of life rhythm＊ can make an influence on our physical condition. (see earlier comment
I think I will get used to this new rhythm eventually."
I signed up for the Frostbite Road Race held at the Yokota Air Base on Jan
We can't always enter the base, but at such an event, we can enter there
It is about three months until then."
I took a super express Hikari for the first time in after a while
It was very comfortable, but we had some trouble with the prepaid card at the transfer
My prepaid card was not usable for the super express, so I bought a ticket, and used it instead
After transferring to the local train, my prepaid card should have been usable for it, but I had an error at the ticket gate
I will go on a business trip starting today until tomorrow
We will write a report about our research about the business strategies at the camp
It will be a huge lot of work
We have been studying since last April, the beginning of the fiscal year of 2010, and we will complete and publish this report by the end of the 2010 fiscal year
Our work reaches its final stage."
My desk is somewhat messy now
I have to clean (up) to make a room on the desk
I discarded some magazines, but it was not enough
More books and magazines should be discarded, but I can't decide which ones to should be discarded
There were some personnel changes in our office this during April, which is a the beginning of the new fiscal year. Using \"this April\" was not wrong. I only replaced it with \"during\" so that the second part of the sentence would fit in better. 
I myself was moved off to another section on the date of April 16th. You can also say: I myself was transferred to another section on April 16th
I had been in charge of my former work section for about six years. I corrected this under the impression that you were section chief, and therefore, that you were in charge of a section
It seemed like a very long time
My job in the former section was rather something like supporting service. Suggestion: My job in the former section was something like taking care of supporting service
Before that, I had been working at the front line of the research and development
I hoped to expand the sphere of my work. Or: I had hoped to expand the sphere of my work
I sometimes asked my boss to let me move off  (or \"transfer\") back there again or to somewhere else other department
The new section where I have moved (or \"transferred\") to now is in charge of the R&D for producing new products
So I am glad to move off have been moved\/ have been transferred
I have to work harder and catch up with the regarding technologies and markets and so on at first immediately. I'm not quite sure what you meant by \"regarding\". Did you mean \"involved
I wish hope we can produce new, great products (suggested word order: \"great, new products\") and release them onto the market soon. "
I don't know why, but problems always occur when I buy a watch. 
This time I bought a sport digital wristwatch for measuring my lap time while running. 
I received it yesterday, but It was different than what I ordered
It was bigger and heavier, which is not suitable for my running
The model numbers of the one I ordered and the one I received are very similar to each other. 
I want to exchange it, so I'll send a letter to the seller
Please correct it for me. 
I also want to know how to write a simpler one and\/or a business style one
I am really looking forward to it
My high school's alumni\/alumnae, whose ages are from about 20 to over 70, will play soccer at on a single team. *alumnus = 1 male graduate; alumna = 1 female graduate; alumnae = female graduates; alumni = female and\/or male graduates; though, many people use 'alumni' for all of these situations
Once or twice a year our club plays matches against other senior soccer teams. or another senior soccer team
We can enjoy playing soccer very much.Nevertheless, we could can not play as smoothly as we used to at high school days. or during our high school days
Thereafter Afterwards\/After the games we go to a party and have a nice time chatting with each other about our recent state catching up ('recent state' isn't used in English the same way it is used in Japanese
We also help each other in both our public and private lives
We have a special friendship not only because we graduated from the same school but because we share the samememories and feelings -atmosphere, things like that - of our childhood days, and so on
I am very muchlooking forward to meeting my old friends\/my old classmates\/the other alumni and playing soccer with them. *Note: a school\/organisation has alumni, not other people; i.e. the university's alumni"
We need to have our cars inspected make our cars to be taken a car safety inspection every two years in Japan.>> the pattern is 'have XX done by YY' e.g. have my hair cut by the barber etc
Our cars have to be checked for safety and we have to pay the maintenance fee, expensive tax and insurance
However, we forget to pay tax or something easily(im not sure what your trying to say exactly but using \"or something easily\" is not correct, i would say just \"...forget to pay taxes very easily\" or something like this
I intend to go to the car maintenance shop for car safety inspection today."
As you know well, we have a lot of work around the beginning and the end of the fiscal year and also at the beginning of the fiscal year
We must review the achievements from the previous fiscal year and plan our target in the new fiscal year
We have to discuss about them with members of our working group
That is why we have busy days in every spring."
I usually run to work, but I take the trains to work on rainy days
We had two days of rain, so I took the trains both days
Since I have to take two trains to work, and there are is some lost time loss, it takes more time to go to work by train than on by foot
On the other hand, the advance advantage is that I can read books in on the train
I could read some classic novels during those these two days. -- Change \"read\" present tense to \"read\" past tense =)"
I still wear a short sleeved T-shirt and shorts while running to and from the office
And a vest on top of that
But I felt a little cold around my arms last night
I wonder if it is time for to wearing a long sleeve shirt
Is winter coming here
It was really an amazing game
We are feel really encouraged."
The 2nd half of the FSY 2011 has started
I transferred to a new office on October 1st
I have to move my things to the new office and to prepare for commuting to the new office
I will be busy this week."
Overslept Again
I am sure that I don't have get enough sleep
Oversleeping is just what I need
I wonder whether is better to take get some rest, or to keep going to and study early in the early morning
Years ago, I made it a habit to get up early and study for some years
But recently, I know became aware that I am in a lacking(or 'losing' instead of 'lacking') of sleep recently
I know the best way thing to do is I know to go to bed early in the night
But it may be better to sleep more for some days, rather than to keep going waking up early to be an early bird
Another typhoon is approaching Japan
It will hit today and pass over Japan today and tomorrow
I hope there will be no damage."
I got up at six this morning
I have to leave by six thirty

Next, the Nano was originally my son's and was lent to me last year
And I bought the Touch this month for myself

With the Skype app, I can make a call to someone
She decided to quit her school club activity after all finally
She had been worrying about it for long time
She loves to play badminton, but she got an injury to her leg
She can't maintain her motivation as she did before
Badminton is a very competitive sports
It is more fun when it is competitiveness
She couldn't play as well as she wanted to due to her leg injury
She couldn't win the matches as she could before
She had worried about things
Then finally, she decided to withdraw from the badminton club
I am sorry, but I think it is good decision for herself
Yesterday was the summer solstice, which has a longest daytime and a shortest nighttime
The sun rises at about 4:30 and sets at about 19:00 around the this day
How long a day that is
Unfortunately, we are in the rainy season in Japan at midsummer, so we can't enjoy the longest day very much
Instead, around midsummer, we enjoy watching the World Cup soccer games held in South Africa on TV 
There is a time difference between here and there, so the games are played during the shortest night
Many soccer fans in Japan are now suffering from the lack of sleep caused by the W-Cup
Of course I am
It is a business trip there
It is my first time to go there and it is the first time since the last travel abroad twenty years ago
I had forgotten the the procedure for going abroad, for example, how to get a passport, what to bring with me, and so on
Last time when I went to America, I rent a bigger case for the 2-week trip, 20 years ago
This time, I will go on a 3-day 4-stay trip, so I bought a carry-on-sized soft case
I will go jogging early every morning in Singapore for a kind of sightseeing, because I don't have enough time for sightseeing, otherwise
I'm looking forward to it
It is about time to have early breakfast and then leave home
Please wish my safe trip and successful business
The summer heat is being washed off by this rain and Fall will come soon here
When someone gives us something, we say, \"Sumimasen
When someone helps us doing something, we also say, \"Sumimasen
Sumimasen\" may usually be translated to \"I am sorry,\" or \"Excuse me.\" In these cases, \"Sumimasen\" doesn't mean a simple apology, but means \"thanks
I don't know why actually it is the real reason, but I think we Japanese think it is a virtue to be modest. For centuries, during our long history, we are said to be we have been called modest and the modesty might have made us say \"Sumimasen\" to express thanks
When someone corrects my poor English, I will possibly say \"Sumimasen\" as well as \"Arigatou\"."
I organised and asked the members to attending the meetings. I also lead the discussions there
We discussed some problems of our researches and came to a consensus on what to do and how to do the tasks respectively
The four meetings took about two hours each totalling eight hours overall
I want to have more free time and wish we could have more efficient meetings

It was the highest ever recorded in September in Japan
However, we feel a cooler and comfortable breeze blowing these days in the mornings and the evenings. these days

I want to wish him a happy birthday to him
He becomes 18 years old. (Again I think: \"He will be 18 years old\" is more natural
He is a good, great, awesome son
I certainly think so 
At least it is true for us, our family.This sentence doesn't make sence
He is healthy, vigorous, tender, diligent,..., well, I can't say enough about him
Maybe I'm may overestimating him because I am his father and I love him very much
Anyway, I am very happy due to on his behalf him
Of course, needless to say, my wife and his younger sister are happy, too. as well
Our family is very happy for him

It is what I wanted and was looking for
I was lucky to get it at a 20% discount price
It was a nice shopping trip."

Do you know what a relay marathon race is about 
Have you ever participated in one 
At the year-end party after the last run in 2009 on Dec.26th, my friends and I chatted while drinking about our running  plans for the next year
One of my friends had taken part in some 100km races before, and another had not done so yet
They are interested but 100km is too long for inexperienced guys, they said
The friend who had experience, suggested that we should participate in a relay marathon together as a team
In a relay race, each runner can run his own distance and time as determined by his ability
Some 24h relay marathons are held in Japan
Our two picks among them will be in July and also in September
How far do you think that we can run for 24hours, 
We must do more long distance training and be able to do it without sleeping for 24h 
We need more team members, too
How many team members do you think are needed for a 24h relay race
We think 8 is the minimum, and 12 is better
Do you think we are weird, running addicts
Fruitful Sunday (I would say \"Productive Sunday\" instead
Such as my hair cut, mow grass, wash cars, jog, and more. (This is a fragment, to fix it, you can say something like \"For example, I had a hair cut, mowed my lawn, washed the cars, jogged, etc.\" Past tense is also needed here
I took very much crowded train last evening. We don't say \"last evening\" so much in English, say either \"last night\" or \"yesterday evening\" which both basically mean the same thing
I went to Tokyo on business and attenda meeting of a committee discussing how to make innovations
It sounds very difficult, doesn't it
Yes, it is a very difficult problem to answer
We have been holding these meetings throughout the year to make our own answer to it
Well, after the meeting, I took a subwayon a private railway to go back home
The evening trains in the Tokyo area are always very crowded
My train was fully loaded with people who were going back home from work or from school
I mostly had to stand on one foot for most of the some time
I could not put my another foot on the floor
After more than one and ahalf hour strugglingon the train, I could finally sit ona seat
As I said yesterday, I will run a marathon in Tokyo
Rain is can even be good for running if it is not very heavy
Especially, this marathon is not a competition of speed, but for enjoying the famous sightseeing sites in Tokyo while we are running slowly
We have four more hours until the race starts, but\/so I will leave home in an hour
I hope this rain will stop or ease off until the start."
There is an earthquake going on right now here in Kanagawa, Japan
It is not very big though. (this sounds more natural
The strong wind warning was issued early in this morning. You can also say \"the warning about strong wind\" but I actually prefer your shorter, simpler sentence
I heard the news in the train on the way to the starting site. \"... train to the starting site\" makes us think that the train is going directly to the starting site. 
I was looking forward to this marathon a lot and was \/ had prepared for it.\"Was prepared for it\": in the sense that you were ready for the marathon VS. \"Had prepared for it\": in the sense that you had made a lot of preparations (i.e. training) for the marathon. You can also say: \"I was really looking forward to this marathon and was (or had) prepared for it
Alternatively: But, we couldn't do anything about it
The wind was getting got weaker and it almost stopped raining. Therefore, my friend and I decided to go jogging at the Imperial Palace instead of the cancelled marathon
We jogged 2 laps there, which is about 10km,  and then we took a the train back home for about 2 hours back home
My body feels sore now because of Saturday's soccer game
Some muscles and joints have had sore
I regularly run on a regular basis, but my muscles got sore after soccer
The intensity of the exercises was stronger than the one during my runs
This sore is not very serious, even feel good for myself. The sore is not very serious, but even with this problem I have a very good feeling for myself
This week will surely be a busy week
I have a presentation next Tuesday, so I have to prepare for it
It might take a while
I also have to organize a few meetings this week
There are three or four, possibly more
I will plan those meetings and cheer them (I am not sure what you mean by \"cheer them\") and then make the proceedings
Lastly, I have parties on Tuesday and Friday evening
This is the first time it's rained in a long while. the first rain in a long while
I think we didn't have haven't had rain for more than 2 months.>> uk english is this way 
I can't remember the last rain.>> '.. the last time it rained' is what i'd say
We have little rain here in Kanagawa prefecture, which is next to Tokyo
It is good from one point of view, but not very good from another one
Getting a good night sleep may refresh myself."
We used to celebrate new adults aged 20 on the Coming of Age Day on Jan.15, the little New Year, prior to 2000
They come back to their hometown on the that day and celebrate celebrated
Girls wear Japanese traditional clothing, like \"kimonos
This is an article about the little New Year although it's in Japanese
My daughter has had a fever since the day before yesterday
She seldom catches a cold and has kept a perfect attendance since the entrance to the elementary school eight years ago
So, she seems to feel really sorry for herself very much
Yesterday, she was taken to a doctor and he checked if she get a got the flu
The test results was were negative and it said she caught an ordinal cold
We are were relieved then
But in the evening, her temperature raisedincreased toover 38 degrees Celsius again. 
Many of her classmates are were absent from school because of the flu yesterday
We are still thinking she have a has the flue flu
She is going back to the doctor todayto be checked again and we hope she  will be given theappropriate medicines today
I ran into an old friend on my way home yesterday
It was fancy great(?) to see her again there
She said told me her family had recently moved to our neighbourhood. (I fancy British English spelling 
We had lived next-door to each other in an apartment more than 15 years ago. (next-door is a common expression 
She has a son that's the same age as my son
They used to play together almost every day when they were toddlers
After my family had moved out, her son and my son played soccer in different teams and sometimes played some matches sometimes when they were elementary school boys
After a long interval of not keeping in touch, we happened to meet by accident
We made a promise to meet again with both families and said good bye
I felt glad to have seen her and heard her family is doing well
The quarrel between my wife and my daughter seems to have finished
Peace came back to my\/our home
I am relieved
Yesterday's dinner was Japanese \"nabe\" stew
The forecast says that much more cedar pollen is flying this year than usual
It will be about several times the amount of last year
My eyes feel itchy and my nose are is runny even with a mask
I take some pills for allergies
They usually work well usual, but their effect may not be strong enough to fight against so much pollen this year
Someone will do longer. This sentence does not make sense."
Headphones are about to die
The headphones for my iPod seem to have something wrong with them
Sounds only comes from only right side, not from the left one
I think there is it's something trouble like a bad wire contact
It is probably because the plug became gets a little rusty from my sweat
I want to get a new pair of headphones before the current ones die
I change my headphones about twice a year, I'm not sure
I am now wondering which ones I should buy for the replacement
For my use while jogging use, high graded, expensive ones aren't necessary
Used up a ballpoint pen
It was a slight minor event, but I felt a bit happy a bit
I have already set put a new refill into the ballpoint pen
It is not an expensive one, but it costs 100yen
What Do you have anything like this slight small but happy event?"
A big earthquake hit New Zealand yesterday
I hope there was no serious damage.ࠠ
Everyone in New Zealand, are you OK,? [sounds more natural in this order
Big aftershocks may hit at some intervals after the a big one.
So we have to be sensitive and be wary of the next big one."
But where and how did they come from
As you know, the frogs lay eggs in water and tadpoles grow up in the water
However, my house is located somewhat apart from a body of water place where frogs' eggs and tadpoles grow. << (this is a litttle more natural
Rice fields are some blocks apart away from my house where they mostly seem to grow. (again, you are correct, but this sounds more natural
And for what reason do they come and live in my garden
Anyway they are cute and are loved by my family."
I posted my previous entry of \"Delivery error
This is the sequel to it
The internet coffee shop sent mea new one the day before yesterday since I had contacted the shop and the home delivery agent and asked them to send me the substitution

One of my tooth fillings came out when I was eating a candy the day before yesterday
I was lucky I didn't swallow it but I could have
I went to the dentist yesterday to get the cavity in my tooth filled again
I am happy it took such a short time
Do you have any cavities now or are they already fixed
My first trip abroad for business
I will go to Singapore on a business trip from next Sunday to Wednesday
It is my first trip abroad on business and the second trip abroad after the one to the US about 20 years ago
I had to have a new passport issued and buy a carry case and some other stuffs for it
I am excited and nervous a little about it now
I wonder whether I should have traveled abroad for leisure, not on business by now
It was like a mid Spring day some day, and like a late Winter day the next.There was nothing wrong with the way you put it except it sounds slightly unnatural
We easily catch cold or get sick in the weather like that
It is probably because I went to a business trip in the cold rain yesterday and stayed outside without my overcoat which was out with the drycleaners
It was chilly cold yesterday. Chilly or cold, but generally you wouldn't say \"chilly cold
We had my office X'mas (maybe better to use \"Christmas\") party yesterday
It was very crowded in the cafeteria where the party was held, rather packed like a commuter train car. (I just rearranged the sentence
Many drinks and dishes were served, but more people were there, so I thought they was not much enough, and it turned out we were was short of quantity
We also had some exhibitions on the stage
Some played musical instruments, danced, or did other party exhibitions
They sounded like very fun, but I couldn't watch nor hear them because of the happy and noisy crowd
We had fun and relaxed for hours at the party
That is, I was very lucky to have won the 1st prize of the lottery at the party
The prize was travel coupons
I will go on a one-night trip with my family to a hot spring not so far away."
I overslept again this morning, so [You can combine this with the next sentence
I stayed up late last night to set up a new version of ubuntu OS
Some trouble seemed to happened, upgrading to 10.10 was failed
So I had to re-install the ver.10.10 with CD-R
It took a long time to download the disk image and install it on to my computer
I wrote something like an excuse, and I think of it as today's journal

I went to a barber shop to get my hair cut

The weather news said this summer was the hottest in over 100 years in Japan
It's the Spring drizzle. I don't mind to get soaked through ...? 
I heard someone on TV said \"It's the Spring drizzle. I don't mind to get soaked through

I have a marathon to run today
I don't like running in the rain very much for sure
That is why I said so as above

The yellow flowers are cute and beautiful by in contrast with the pink sakura flowers

I learned phrases to use for closing conversations
Surprisingly, I didn't learn them until now (近頃なら：recently, or just recently).

The blackouts will be planned to shut off electricity for three and half hours in the Kanto, Tohoku and Chubu districts which are further divided into five areas in order
My area will be the 4th area to have electricity cut off
This electric power cut will be continued for long time
My father in law visited us the day before yesterday
He stayed here for a night and left to play golf early yesterday morning. 
Our home is located near his favorite golf courses, so he often comes over to our home on the way to there
Have you ever heard of it
Dan\" means deny, \"Sha\" means throw away and \"Ri\" means separate
We can achieve a simple life by denying, throwing away and separating from any things around us that are bothering us
I have a lot of these things that I rarely use or almost waste
I am sure you share my feeling."
In Japan, a common saying is \"疾風に勁草を知る
It has the same meaning as that of the English proverb \"In a calm sea every man is a pilot
The saying is translated to \"We can only know which plant is truly strong during strong wind
We can know who really is tough only in tough situations
Adding to that, though sometimes we may get into a difficult and tough situation, we should think of it as a good chance to improve ourselves
I'm sorry if this sounds too didactic
I just happened to remember this saying while running in the headwind
Ran to the public bath
My friends and I had a plan for refreshing ourselves
That was, to jog to a public bath, which is called Sento in Japan, to take a bath together (or \"to bathe together\"), and then to go for a drink
Doesn't that sounds good? (Or \"Sounds good, doesn't it
We did enjoy it. (Or \"We enjoyed it
It was (much) more fun to chat with 4 men during the two hour long jog than to jog by myself in the dark evening. (OR It was (much) more fun to chat with 4 men (along the way) than to jog by myself for about 2 hours
We get a day off from work tomorrow
We usually have two days off on the weekend usually, but we had work last Saturday to avoid the rolling blackouts
It was unusual, so I didn't feel refreshed enough last weekend
However, with the warmer weather, there is less electricity being consumed
So, we will not have blackouts for a while — at least for this April
To be clear, what I've written above is not an April Fools' joke
Hoping for world peace
We Everyone hopes for world peace
We have many friends all over the world to thanks to development and spread of internet communications
For example, we can use useful sites like this site (this one), lang-8
The development of scientific technology (\"technology\" is usually singular)must be used for realizing world peace and for reducing starvation and poverty
We should make every efforts to realize world peace
What can we ourselves do for that?"
Marathon Race, Yesterday
I ran a marathon (race) yesterday. Usually we just say \"marathon\". The fact that it is a race is implied. (but I'm being picky here... what you wrote isn't wrong, this is only a suggestion
As practice for next weekend's ultra marathon, I planned to run at the ultra pace: about 6'30\" \/ km, but I ran a little fast than planned. (I think this is better here
It was not so easy to run at slower than the comfortable pace
So instead of that, I ran there alone yesterday
I like the Fuji Five Lakes, which have nice scenery
I felt very good, but a little alone lonely while running
Anyway, it was a good substitute."
A Nice New Week
Another new week has started. Or: \"It's the beginning of another week
I have a bit of a headache a little this morning
Last week, the weather forecast said it would be cooler starting Monday
On Sunday, it said it would be cooler starting Tuesday, and on Monday starting Wednesday. 
Summer is still staying here and Fall hasn't arrived yet. 
Some young caterpillars are on the branches of citrus trees in our garden
Our lemon tree and grapefruits trees are almost leafless
I hope they can turn into beautiful butterflies
Hang in there, Japan! 
Yesterday the Japanese soccer team beat Denmark's team and was able to advance to the knockout stage
We Japanese were very happy for that
In spite of the time the game was shown, whether early in the morning or late in the night, many people watched the game on TV
To tell the truth, we didn't really expect our team to advance, because they lost all of their friendly matches before the World Cup (had begun
So we didn't believe they would be able to advance to the second phase, called the knockout stage
We are very happy and proud of their awesome plays and performances
We hope they'll be able to win their games one after another in the tournament
Hang in there, Japan!!"
I'll share with you an interesting figure
Which way do you think the cat is turning, clockwise or counterclockwise
Happy Merry Christmas to you all!"
I also had some time to review the questions
I thought it was better the one I took last year
However, what I good score expect is not always the score I get
I hope I can get a good score
I think my English skill is getting better step by step
I worked late until about 11pm yesterday
It made me very tired
Yesterday was no exception
I ran back home after work for half an hour at about 11pm last night
I was half asleep while running
My eyes were half shut
I was about to fall sleep while running. [or \"fall asleep on my feet
I slapped myself on the cheeks sometimes, so that I would not fall asleep
I didn't think I could not do so, but now I think I probably can
However it would be very dangerous. Of course you all know this
We must be careful not to get into an accident while running
Cutting the hedge
I pruned it heavily this time
Twelve big dust bags were filled with cut branches and leaves
I hit a bike on the way home from the office last night
The accident happened on a dark sidewalk
The bike approached straight toward me from in front of me
I stepped aside to the right
He turned toward the same side I was turning to unfortunately, so the bike bumped straight into me
Both the bike fell down and the biker fell to the ground
I was worried about his head, but he said he was alright
He was not riding on his bike very fast, so he had no injuries
Luckily, I had no injuries at all
Did I gotget interviewed
I interviewed some applicants, who were either university students or graduate school students
They presented their work at their university at first, and then we asked some questions for examiningto determine whether they are appreciateappropriate to join our company or not
It was my first time to do doingthis
So I was somewhat nervous, of course less nervous than the applicants
I'm sure it was very difficult to estimate someone's abilities, at least for me now.(I'm sure it is very difficult to estimate someone's ability. At least it was for me. OR It was very difficult for me to estimate people's abilities.)Sorry, it was just easier to just rewrite the sentence
It seemed to me that they all are great guysworkers now or will be in the future, even if some of them didn't make very good presentationimpression(?)at this time.(Sorry, had to guess at what your meant for the last bit. \"Guys\" is a bit informal for the rest of this text, so I replaced it with \"workers\". You might want to say \"people\" or \"applicants\" maybe
I felt fatigued,even exhausted after I finished all the interviews. (OR ... \"after all the interviews finished
We have a lot of rain this season
I got completely soaked by the rain
My body needs more longer sleep
There are two weekly reports and one monthly report that has to go to my laboratory president
Hot summer, gone
It was cooler than usual last night
Has the hot summer gone with the rain at last
I'll feel glad\/great if it turns out to be true, but at the same time, I feel kind of sorry
How was this summer for you? = [How was your summer
How did you enjoy this\/your summer
I ran some a detour before heading to the office. (I jogged for a bit before heading to the office
While jogging along the Sakawa river path, I caught up with a runner and cheered him on, we didn't know each other by then, but we jogged along and chatted for a while
He said he is planning to run a half marathon next month and is practicing for it
I didn't know that Father's Day was not an event only in Japan
It said \"Thanks, dad.\" Of course, I was very pleased. (either way is okay, this is an alternative
We should be good to our parents, needless to say. (There are a lot of alternatives that you could use here. But 'do good' doesn't sounds right to me
I made an entry into a 100km marathon race
It is a \"100km\" marathon
It is twice as long as an ordinary \"42.195km\" marathon
It will be held on April 25th, 2010. (If you are just saying the month you can say \"in April\" or \"in July.\" If you are saying the month and the say you will want to say \"on April 25th,\" or \"on July 3rd
This is my first time to running in a 100km race, so I don't know what will happen to me during the race and whether or not I will be able to finish it
I will train and enjoy running myself and I will definitely accomplish it
What will happen to me when I can finish it
It is taller and bigger and has many more flowers than other kinds
It starts blooming from the southern part to the northern part of Japan, so the the Sakura-Zensen , the front line of cherry blossoms, go farther the north day by day
I went jogging to one of the famous cherry blossom seeing sites to check the degree of its blooming
They will have not started blooming
I think two weeks later will be the best timing to see and enjoy them
I will go running a maranic today
This maranic is not a marathon (competition race), but one that is a marathon distance of easy and fun run
The word \"maranic\" is made of the words \"marathon\" and \"picnic
It is very fun and good for a marathon training
I should be careful not to fall slip down
This is a picture of the view of a paddy field and Mt. Fuji from a rural area
I took this photo yesterday while running on the bike trail where I jog weekly
There's no water in the paddy field in the winter
It was a very nice day (out) with not a cloud in the sky
The sharp contrast between the blue of the sky, the white of the snow on the mountain, and the color of withered rice plants on the soil is very beautiful."
The rainy season front line stays near Japan during the period because of the conflict between the high pressure systems and the low pressure systems

Someone might happen to lose their health
To say the truth, we may feel relief while working on everyday's tasks, and may feel somewhat anxious when we have some free time in the evening on a weekday.[hours is ok, just suggesting time as an alternative and more general word here
We don't have any idea what to do and how to spend it. (家族と時間を過ごせる？？

Waterfall Training
I saw this yesterday on the way of the trail running on the mountain trail with friends
They were being beaten by the very cold water under the waterfall while yelling some Buddhist sutras
I am not sure but they may be training as Buddhist monks or for becoming Buddhist monks
As You see, they were almost naked except only Fundoshis-- Japanese traditional men's underwear. I don't have my own, unfortunately
Have you ever done the waterfall training or seen anything like this actually
I think you don't think you like blisters either
I cut off the skin and removed the fluid in the blister myself
Now, it doesn't hurt any more
Although However, I think you good boys  guys should not emulate me in completing this action yourself
Maybe you should see a doctor or something

These days, we have cooler nights than before these days than before
They are good for getting good sleep. [avoid repeating 'good' twice: They are perfect for getting good sleep
They can be
But Unfortunately, I can't haven't been able to sleep well get good sleep for a couple of months. [avoid starting a sentence with 'But', 'And', 'So'. This is a common mistake for Japanese speakers
I have only had shallow and short sleep
I've been waking up several times in the a night almost every day
I feel sleepy during the day in the daytime. ['in the daytime is correct, but 'during the day' feels more natural
It is not efficient to work while I feel sleepy. I'm not efficient at work when I feel sleepy
I am in trouble with it. This is bothering me."
That was why I couldn't run to work and not or go out for a lunchtime jog
I wanted to run because I'm now going on challenging trying to to run every single day, you know, as posted a few days before. or I am challenging myself to run every single day
Therefore, I dared to run through the rain back home from work in my casual wear, which was not for running, like a pair of jeans, a casual shirt and a jacket, and additionally\/also with the umbrella up
I probably looked like a person in a hurry to get somewhere, for example, not to be late for a train, work, dinner, or something
Anyway, at least I could get some running in yesterday
We had three cold days and four warm days in the last seven days \/ this past week. [Is that what you meant
It is raining outdoors just now
It is a cold rain
I hope it is not so cold in the Tohoku disaster area

It will The weather will be fine today, so I can run outside, and I will achieve my goal

I think the letters with fountain pens look better than those with ballpoint pens, I think
The writing feels smoother, so it's more comfortable for me, too
It is a casual and inexpensive, but stylish one
I set an ink converter on it, filled with my favourite ink, and wrote some letters
I loved it. If you are talking about loving the pen, and still love the pen, then you need to keep your sentence in the present tense. Using the past tense while talking about the pen, as in \"I loved it\" means that either: 1) you do not love the pen anymore or 2) you don't have that pen anymore.If you are talking about loving the experience with that pen, then you can write, \"I love writing with that pen
But I had something trouble with it
Does it need to be repaired
or replaced?, I wondered and asked to the pen shop I bought it from
They said that a repair is not necessary, it will be all right if it's washed, left to dry and resetting the ink converter
And then, the ink stopped leaking from my favorite pen! You can also combine this sentence with the previous sentence like so: \"Well, I did it and the ink stopped leaking from my favorite pen
Needless to say, I loved it more than before
At the ambassador secretary's office
I went to the ambassador secretary's office to have a meeting yesterday
It was the first time for me to go to such a place
I didn't have any of such opportunities ever before
It was for discussing about regarding our visit to a foreign country
I met an (the) ambassador secretary and talked with him. Using \"an\" indicates there may be more than one ambassador secretary
He spoke Japanese very fluently as if he was Japanese and introduced us to his country's industry and economy, which is his work, of course
He may probably become an ambassador or at something important post some day, I believe
This visit was a very good experience for myself."

They have to shoot more. <- or \"take more shots\""

The methods of successful brain training for runners, by Prof
Nariyuki Hayashi, who is a professor of the Dept
of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Nihon Univ., are quoted below
Focus on what you're doing

Take care to keep a good posture
Keep your focus even when reducing the amount of practice before races

To get there we will be taking the Shinkansen super express for about 3 hours. this sounds more natural
We both love my brother and his wife
We wish that they will have a very happy life forever."
We are having a get-together at work tonight, so I didn't run, but walked to work in 30 min this morning
That's because I don'tdidn'twant to go the restaurant with my usual running gears on. (even though you may have more than one item on, gear means the whole running outfit
When I'm not running, it is too cold with them onwith just my running gear on.It's enough to get a cold
I put on trousers, a knit hat\/shirt(? Don't know what you mean), and a coat today unlike usual me."
Excuse for today's oversleeping
I came home late last night from the business trip in a packed train
It was very tough to be in such a crowded train
It was so packed that I couldn't breath well in the train. -is that what you meant by \"breeze
Is this a good enough excuse for oversleeping today
He put some fishes into my tank, which were unfamiliar for to me
This was a story from my dream several days ago
The National Center Test for University Admissions is being held today and tomorrow
My eldest son will take the examination, so he left home just now
I hope he can pass the entrance examination so he will be able to go to the university of his first choice
BTW, there is another one.(another test
BTW, my daughter will be taking an entrance examination to the high school of her choice in the week after next, too
They both have to take an exam but not I
Now, what can I do for them as their father
To cheer themup, to take care of their needs, 
No, I don;t think so. They have to be on their own
What I can do is just to be my usual self
I went for cycling to Kamakura with my wife yesterday
This cycling is our annual event in the Golden Week holiday
First we rode to the sea, to Enoshima through the seaside route
It is famous for very fresh seafood. (\"It\"  may refer to Enoshima or the restaurant
We visited the shrine, Turugaoka Hachimangu
We had a wonderful holiday."
My LAN router has two networks
The PC and the printer were not in the same network, so the PC could not print any documents using the printer
I configured them into the same network to make the PC recognize the printer on its network
I finished one of my challenges finished
My ten\/seven\/thirty straight days running finished finally. (you need to write a number before \"straight days
Yesterday it was abnormally cold yesterday for a spring day
Furthermore, it has been raining all the day
Thus, one of my challenges was to finally run every single day at last
Eventually, my record was the straight 123 straight days eventually
Another three days weekend
I will run in a 24 hour relay race at the Hiratsuka Park
We will compete to see how far we can run in 24 hours
It will be a lot of fun!"
Actually, I don't like to run while getting soaked in the rain especially in early Spring
If I run in a warm season like Summer, I like running in the rain
Anyway, I was prepared to get soaked during the marathon
Do you wear a wristwatch when you go jogging or running
But then I also felt being set free from caring about my running time
I have always run while thinking about how fast, for how long, and how far I run
Running does not always need to be a competition against someone
We can enjoy it more than that
We can enjoy just running, that is easier and more relaxed, like walking and hiking, for example
Take it off and leave it in your home, and go running
And then, you will probably feel very good!"
The Meteorological Agency announced yesterday the end of the rainy season in areas including Kanto
It feels hotter but less humid yesterday than before
After working long overtime, I ran back home from my office for to refreshing myself last night
New years' days are seems to me as if it was yesterday
By the way, we should have a worth quality time every day and every month. (Not sure I understood what you meant here
My new month's resolution is that I will write entries everyday on February
I am very sorry that my today's entry doesn't contain anything contents
It seems it is just for the declaration of my resolution
Which one is correct, \"February begins\" or \"February starts\" ?"
To your family, to your friends ,to your neighbors, to your coworkers, to strangers, and so on
Many people taking a morning walks or bike rides. 
Most of them greet me back, too
It is a happy feeling to exchange morning greetings with warm smiles, don't you think so? 
When I could exchange good greetings with people, I feel it will be a nice day
I will go to the Yokota Air Base to run a marathon today
The air is clear. 
The sky is sunny. 
It's a brightening and shining day
It was her first date in her life
She went to the Tanabata Festival in Hiratsuka, which is one of the more popular festivals here
Well, this post is not about the date of Hikoboshi and Orihime, who are the couple of the Tanabata legend, but the one of my daughter and her boy friend
It took a long time for her to choose clothes and makeup
She asked me many times if she looked odd
Of course she looked very pretty to me
She reported to us all; her family, about her date after she came home
She said her boyfriend is very tender towards her
See seemed to have had a happy and fun time on her first date
Do you remember your first date
Of course it is my great sweet memory."
Tried to climb Mt. Fuji, but couldn't finish 
My wife and I went to climb Mt
Fuji, but on the way, I felt bad and dizzy, maybe because of low blood sugar or altitude sickness
I had to go back after reaching the seventh station
The Difficulty of posting daily entries
I decided to make daily posts on the lang-8 journal at the beginning of this year as for my my new years resolution. (Since it is your New Year's resolution, it can be assumed that you started at the beginning of the year
But I found it very difficult to consistently post journals on every single day
At First, why do I post
And I want to make friends with people from around the world. (\/people from foreign countries) (\"Foreign people\" isn't wrong, I thought it just sounded better to change it
The Ssecond, what should I post
The ordinary stuffs around me may be ordinary for me, but may not be ordinary for you, especially in foreign countries. Things that are ordinary to me may not be ordinary to people from other countries
I always understand it. (Not sure what you are trying to say in this sentence. What do you always understand
When I write, I want to write interesting and useful journals, eh
There
I made today's post
I finished enjoying browsing boots to buy, and decided to buy a good pair of boots at last
They are an early Christmas present for myself
I ordered them from a shop on the web
I couldn't have found the same type of boots in stores nearby, so I ordered them from the web
I am slightly afraid whether they will fit my feet (or not
I think they will fit because they are lace-to-toe boots
I am looking forward to receiving them
A big and strong typhoon is approaching
Now it is near on the south of Japan in the Pacific Ocean and heading north toward Japan very slow
The slow typhoons bring much rain and serious damages
We had a lot of rain yesterday and it will have today and this weekend, according to the weather forecast."
Got an iPod touch
It's a new iPod touch. (I think this is more natural
I ordered it last Saturday and received it yesterday. (Your sentence wasn't wrong but I think it's better not to use the passive in this case
I installed some apps from Apps Store and musics\/songs from my itunes
With this iPod touch and WiFi connection, we can use email, Twitter, Facebook, and so on
We can use it like as a telephone, nevertheless it is not an iPhone
We had an important meeting of our business meeting yesterday
I could not wake up at the usual time
Anyway, TGIF
What do you say in English when you leave home
And what do you say when coming back home
In Japanese we say, \"Ittekimasu\", which means \"I will leave home.\" and \"Tadaima\" : \"I just came back home
I ask your favor to tell me these expressions
I also what to know those in other languages."
Yesterday, I managed to complete the long distance ultra marathon
Fuji and its beautiful lakes was great; many volunteers worked for the runners very kindly, and many local people in the area cheered very friendly and warmly
I ran this race for the second time. At The first time was last year and I had run 100km
It was tougher than I expected
But I finished it
But it is even somehow comfortable."
We will discuss not only the team tasks but also individual tasks too
It is very important for us to do a good job
I hope it will be a meaningful and worthwhile meeting
I hope I do a good job
Have you made your new year's resolution for 2011
To be nicer to others around me than before, especially to my wife
To prioritize other before not to myself but to others
I have to clarify the goal at first.to clarify the goal first
To complete my first 112km ultra marathon by the end of April
I want to have friends with whom I can speak English
Do I have some stresses
We enjoy running and viewing the beautiful sunset and the color changing of the sky to the dusk. color of the sky changing when it was dusk
We spoke about various things while running
I am sure she is at the age of weight-conscious
Most women are sure to wish to lose weight, not at special age, but at all age. Most women wish to lose weight not at a special age, but at all ages
We had a fun time."
I went to watch the movie Harry Potter yesterday
It was the last one of the Harry Potter series
I enjoyed both the books and the movies in the Harry Potter series
The main characters grew up over the years and throughout the series, the actors and actresses did too
The last movie was interesting
But if you are going to see the movie, it's better to have read the original work before going to the cinema
If you do that, it will be much more enjoyable."
Unfortunately, it started raining late at night
I could not run back home in the rain, so I took a train to home for and it took about an hour
But I did not have usual clothes, but only my sports outfit for running, such as which has no sleeves and half pants
I took train with the in my running outfits
So there were not many people in on the train and or at the stations
I felt ashamed, even though I knew no one looked at me. [This is ok, but you could also say \"even though I knew no one was looking at me
I will dance at the year-end party of my division tomorrow
It will be like a short performance for myself
I have to learn, memorize and to keep in my memory, and to dance by myself in front of my colleagues at the party
I have some not particularly expensive ones.[You can say 'pens' again, but as you are already talking about them as the subect, 'ones' sounds more natural
They each cost less than ten dollars
They are just for my casual use
I can write with them more smoothly than I can with ballpoint pens because of the  viscous oil-based ink.comparisons are tricky. You have to compare nouns with nouns and verbs with verbs
I have a number of beautiful colored ink for fountain pens made by Montblanc, Perikan, Sailor, and so on
Blanc, Perikan, Sailor, and so on
The bottles of ink are very beautiful too
I enjoy writing with them at work and at home every day.[Note the space in 'every day'. --> You use these everyday pens every day
The last thing that I have to do is to write memorable things like articles, journals, essays, paintings, 
I like early mornings in the summer
It has a distinct atmosphere, don't you think so
Early birds are singing and the air is fresh before the sunrises
It seems to gets hot during the day, but we can it feels fresh in the early morning
The Another hot day will begin today also
I am busy at work, in these days
The monthly total amount of overtime was over 100 hours in straight two straight months. (or two months in a row
I have to do many things on in my job in order to achieve many big and small goals
I have to do submit daily, weekly and monthly reports to my big bosses respectively
I feel that time flies
My body feels sore here and there
Many other walking events are also held in Japan
The old and the young take part in the events and enjoy walking and seeing the scenery. (I simplified this
It was very nice weather yesterday
Not so cold or hot, without chilly wind
We enjoyed walking in the rural area, by an orange field, riverside, oceanside, and so on
Those made my muscles sore
I make it a habit to get up early and study English in the morning. (Similar pattern to \"I make it a priority...\" Also correct would be \"I make a habit of getting up
However, I can not get up early these days. (\"These days\" implies the present
Even if I wake up once, I go back to sleep again for about an hour
In my mind I want to get up early, but my body want to sleep more. (You don't only want to get up early in your mind, but in reality. 
It may be because I can't sleep well at night
Well, it's all right
I don't think I have to blame myself for oversleeping
I want to rate all of them highly, but I can not do so, as you know. [it's more natural to write 'I want to give all of them good (or excellent) ratings but I can't, as you may expect
Some can be highly-rated, and others can not be. [it's more natural to write 'I can only give a high rating to some of them
I feel sorry for them all the time. [it's more natural to write 'I always feel sorry for those who won't get a good rating.']"
We came back home from Kobe just now
Japan's National Team couldn't win the game with Paraguay yesterday
The game went into the penalty shoot outs and Japan lost in it, unfortunately
It has been growing very fast in these days
I couldn't cut it last weekend, so it has grown too high
I think I would have cut it this weekend, but it's a pity that I can't do so now due to the rain now. (Or \"I thought I would cut it this weekend, but
I should put that\/it off that till the next weekend
I just start Lang-8
I'm a student
English is very hard."
Japan should wake up and recover our identity and live humbly and simply and stop relying too much on imports for food
and so is my husband, Louis. (這個用法好像要跟前面那句用逗點連成一句話
★He said that we're in the world of SF
My boss said,  \"you are in charge today, well, they need to be able to talk politely!\" 
My boss said that I should plan the training but not change the basis. 
The bosses of this hotel were too strict with the new workers , and a lot of new faces have left it so far
I wanted to make the training more cheerful and wanted to give the new employees a good feeling, so I planned the training
My boss said that I should plan the training but not change the basis. 
By the way, the training includes linguistic training
I'm not very good with that, because I haven't  lived abroad like all the other employees
Because only I have not lived abroad in all the employees
Therefore, even though  I have been studying English, Russian, Korean, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese, I'm not fluent
Next, I'll have to be fluent in Korean for the hotel
The following phrases are the  English that we practiced today
Anytime next week will be fine
Your room is 1230 on the 1277th floor
One of them started laughing saying that it couldn't be
Are we in the fantasy world right now?\"  (SF? Science fiction
Another man said, laughing
And a new employee wondered whether the hotel was in the space colony
I asked her what was so funny
One woman said that everybody who was laughing atsuch a thing wasn't that smart
I thought it was too  late to stop now 
Therefore,　I said that  now I have more responsibilities, but I am getting paid just the same. 
Then all the new employees laughed again
However, I was a little bit too serious.～～；
I think that maybe I will apologize to my boss for having made the training petty."
It is better not to give up(?)."
【A very long entry】　P.S. I'm so sorry, these are very long sentences, but it's light reading
I had been in a difficult situation all this week long
In my company, while I had gone to South Korea to take an official trip till yesterday, the problem occurred
I heard the  problem for the first time yesterday
That is my first boss staged a walkout and is not working at our office any longer for three days
★The reason is because our company's boss B decided to get fire his subordinates (they are my colleagues
I asked boss B about me  because boss A wasn't there, which three people had to restructure from our fellow workers. 
I declined, and went on strike too
My boss A was surprised and said, \"you have courage to actually  refuse my request
Boss B closed the company and said said he forgave my opinion.  
He gave me a severe look and was standing silently in front of me for a moment 
The next day I was invited to his room
He said to me, \"to that end,you must work  harders and follow my instructions
Because of that, I wasn't able to take any days off during the national holidays in May
So,I have been getting the National holiday of the taking the place since yesterday. 
I probably look cheerful, but I feel conflicted because of this problem. 
I want be indispensable  at work."
I am planing to go to Canada on a business next week
But if I  go abroad, I will suffer from jet lag during ※April and May
Even a doctor 
didn't doesn't know the cause
If it is a Korean business trip, I don't worry since it is close to my country
Maybe from now on, I will refuse to go on business trips
I am hesitating because I have never been to Canada. 
Because I have never been to Canada

It has been over one week that I do havenot sign in this corner, . Today I find that there is not any new friend visit here,.Perhaps I need spend more time on this platform, but how can I finish my works???"
My nickname \"Unicorner\" means \"the corner of you & I\", friends from all over the world are welcomed to visit this corner and leave words
Usually students feel sleepy in the afternoon class, so the teacher ask us some interesting questions, 
And I think these interesting questions is a good topic to chat with your friends
Look at the following questions and after you finish it, take a look at the explanations below
Q1: Write down your short story which includes a rabbit, a bridge, 
a key, and yourself
Q2: You’re walking into a forest, what animal do you see first
sight in the forest
Describe how you feel about this animal
Q4: And Then you enter a little cottage with a table inside, what’s the
Q5: There’s a cup on the table, what do you think how much water is in the cup
I don’t like online games, it has no good story, and all you need to do is beat the monsters again and again then it never ends…
But many people enjoy it because they can make friends by beating a boss monster or defend their castles together
It really provides good social function but it's just not what I’m looking for
If I were serving on a jury, I would say that the three survivors were guilty, even though the cabin boy as a was a volunteer to sacrifice himself, and even though the cabin boy was the loser of their lottery game
Some people might said argue: the cabin boy was just an orphan, and the survivors had families, and the boy’s life kept all three of them alive
But in my opinion, no one has power to decide whether another should be live or die; if we accept that they were left no choice but to kill the cabin boy to live, does it mean (if you have the verb 'does' then 'mean' can't have an S at the end of it) which we believe in human rights which we believe in (this is WEIRD to me, to say \"believe in\" for human rights, because to me it seems that it doesn't matter if you believe in them or not - they are still rights; also, it almost sounds like you can pick and choose which rights you believe in, or that everyone believes in them, which both are untrue... I'd leave it out the bold, personally), such as that all men are born with the natural right to life, could be broken in special occasions?"
On last Tuesday, I felt tired from all morning, but I managed to go to the college
After the third lesson, I absented myself  from the fourth lesson and went home because of my too extreme tiredness

My mother and I went took me to a the hospital

For About for 4 days, I wandered drifted between 38 and 39 degrees
After that, I got on a bath scale the bathroom scales and found my weight had dropped decrease 3kg
I could sleep as if my body got rotten like the dead and moreover I could lose 3kg my weight could get 3kg less

Hi, this is Ichi
Looking back, a half year ago, I applied for a leave of absence by power and worked hard on a part-time job so hard
Then it is little time until my departure
10 days later, I'm on top of the Pacific Ocean with an airplane
It is impossible to believe changing things around me
because I put a neck tie on my suit and said \"A motive I want to work in your company
etc\" till half a year ago
Frankly speaking, Working Holidays is estimated by companies unlike differently from a regular going abroad to study
It is said that it is difficult to promote a plus factor compare with to a normal college days that you take 4 years from the day that you enter to graduate
but
Is it a lack of my sense of crisis

But I thought Japan won the game out of luck. (or you could say:) But I thought Japan just got lucky
So I think it'll be hard for Japan to win WBC this year
I thought this more and more when l saw the third game, when Japan lost to Korea
Korea is very strong, and especially strong when playing against Japan. (i wasn't sure exactly what you wanted to say, so I guessed
I worried about Ichiro, the Major Leauge Baseball player--he is in very bad conditions. (do you mean his health or his baseball skills
But in the final game, he had four hits and final shot. (i'm not sure what that means... do you mean he scored the point that won the game
And Japan broken Korea and got first prize. (instead of broken, you could say pummeled, or smashed, or took down, etc.

Therefore So l worry about the ceremony's success
Fortunately But this ceremony was very successful full of success
and everyone thanked said \"thank you\" to me
l felt great
But I still can't believe that I was graduated from high school
And l am feeling very so nervous because I can't meet my friends. (don't understand your friends? or some friends
I love having friends very very very much
I can't live without them!!"
How to Study English (Words
I want to be a good English speaker
But I haven't memorized many English words, and I think I have to memorize them
I tried making word book but this doesn't help me
Please tell me good way to memorize words."
J-league(Japanese soccer league) has started last Saturday
l felt very excited because Banga is a very strong team and in the last match in Jan
Nagoya lost to this team in Jan
My favorite national team is Spain
The Spanish team's passwork is very very smooth like river.(More natural if you do not use the analogy
I want Spain to win this world cup
Of course,I want Japan to reach the final tournament
Do you like soccer,and which team do you think will win the World Cup do you think?"
Since During this month, I've sometimes cooked lunch

Cafe Party
My friends held a Cafe party today
 Are they your sisters
The sisters very enjoyed making them very much
「captain of the party」の意味が分かりません・・・ In English, a party does not usually have a \"captain\".  'captain' = 船長?  Of a ship
It was a very good time."
today I go visit her sister sujin. [ combined with next sentence 
Her house is in Shinchon. Today I am going to visit her sister sujin in Shinchon. [ or if you mean *your* sister: \"Today I am going to visit my sister in Shinchon.\" 
Today I was studying all the day
I hate a studying, when I do it makes me so tired

My friend showed meme Lang-8. It's the best way to have fun while studying a language

The second time was in America, when I was in college
It's was for two years ago
I went to Illinois state
And I am interested in a job which is dealing with English
I am a new employee and I manage a Children's English school
Everyday, I teach children who are 2-10 years old
I'm gonna eat Russian cuisine tonight
What's the taste of it?! How does it taste
I'm looking forward to eating it
I fight with TOEIC!! (maybe a better word for \"fight\" is \"struggle
Although I'm undergoing a slump, I can't give it up
In contrast to my appearance, I'm arduous
Moreover, I treasure these days when I do my best
I might be flying when I goal in. Not exactly sure of the meaning here, maybe \"I might be flying by the time I finish
I'm confused about their meanings. of them
For example, here is are some sentences
It was very hot weather all day long
I rode my bike and went along the sea shore
At last, I arrived at \"A big zelkova\" in Galhwa
On my back way, I saw (the) blue sky and a green field where the sun set
That was more beautiful than I have ever seen
I thought that today was a very special day."
It's a long time. Maybe - \"It has been a long time since I went shopping with my family
SO, I'm expecting to spend great time. Not sure what you mean here, maybe:1. So, I'm expecting to have a great time.2. So, I'm expecting to spend a lot of money.3. So, I'm expecting to spend a lot of time shopping
First I want to buy some new clothes so that I can attend my graduation ceremony
That wish has now come true
What I made me angry
I always enjoy borrowing some books
So I couldn't borrow any books. [The library is \"lending\" books. You are \"borrowing\" them
It made me exhausted. \/ I felt exhausted
On my back way, I dropped by the Academy Photoshop
I can't remember how to describe the shop in English
It is the place which takes pictures or sells film
I had trouble taking my photos
because the shop owner let me wasted my time
I hate to wait for a long time
She said to me, Please wait about 1 hours
As time went by, she said to me, \"Wait
just a moment
She told me the same thing over and over again
At last, I had waited for more than 30 min
She said to me, \"Could you come back tomorrow
I can't stand to wait for a long time and be told a lie
I'll never go there again
I studied TOEIC, but I don't know which sentence is correct
The cost would be compared\/ comparable
I thought they were almost the same
Despite resistance\/ resisting
I learned the grammar (preposition + ~ing) 
However, the answer is 'resistance
Lately, I have been interested in astrology
My star sign is the 'Leo
I read a book about it several days ago
It said that 'Leos' could be attractive to some people
but it also said that 'Leos' might be lonely people
I perfectly agree with that
Of course, everyone feels loneliness
One of my hobbies is watching movies and foreign dramas
There is something about \"The modern Sherlock Homes
 This photo is of an actor called by '베네딕트 컴버배치
I tried to write some sentences by in English
At last, I finished writting writing about my last Seoul trip
It was erased my by mistake
I think that was an exciting story
I spent one hour to finish to write my diary
Who will is comport comfort me now
This is my first time to on lang-8
Because I just started learning French, so I need more practice
It's been for 4 years since I came to the U
S
but my English skills haven't progressed much
I know I have to speak more and more for improvement of my English, but when I talk to somebody in English, I get confused and I forget words
I heard that if I keep a diary in English, my speaking skill would progress too
I'm studying English by singing English songs
I participated in a small party today. It was only older people
I was tense
but so happy today :-) (I had a great time today.)"
I wrote this diary with the help of Yahoo!翻訳
to see \"Yahoo!翻訳
In return, I'll teach Japanese
Let's talk with \"skype
My ID is gohann3bai
Thank you
I enjoy listening to Secondhand Serenade's songs.

I'm a candidate in this election, and at 11 to 12 o'clock I will introduce myself and show (the) students my past executive university work in the field of Computer Science. (About the time: If you are introducing yourself sometime between 11 and 12, you would say \"and around 11 or 12 o'clock...\" If you are introducing from 11 to 12, you would say \"and from 11 to 12 o'clock...\" It wasn't clear from your sentence

Amaryllis's are blooming
The founr flowers are like an antique record player
They seem to flow with the beautiful music."
Anyway, i think that the team japan's team's target is should be \"do not forget which is their goal!!\"."
Tonight I saw the film version of \"The Phantom of Opera\" at home, which is played on TV for almost three hours
But its music is really fantastic. The voice of the leading actress deeply appealed to me
The beautiful voices in the movie have impressed me a lot. surely Like a haunting melody in my mind
I was truly touched by this sentimental movie, especially when the phantom let Christine and Raoul go, I couldn't help but shed my tears
I sympathize with the phantom a lot though he is sometimes too cruel. But I think it's his society that made him crazy
How lonely he was
It's a pity that he couldn't bring his talent into full play
He was a genius
Well, since I will go to NY this summer vacation, I expect to go to Broadway to watch this show live
Sometimes I may be confused when I go to ask someone out for dining or accompaniment
Japanese is so charismatic and magical that it can express what you want to say clearly but not too strongly
Through the language, I can relieve myself from the sense of vulnerability in my interpersonal relationships
While I expect to write in Japanese. I have found that I cannot type in Japanese on my computer
To polish my Japanese writing skills, it's time to download the software to type in Japanese
And I have to do my homework. Usually, we shouldn't start sentences with And or But
In the At night, I will do a part time job
I'm a bakery
I will play hang out with my friends this Sunday.Usually, we don't use \"play\" with friends if you are older than middle school age
Then I'll do a part time job too
I can't wait for summer vacation
My summer vacation will start in September
I am looking forward to doing all of them
I will go to Tokyo with my friends and go to the recreation with other friends
I have to do a part time job, because I don't have very much money very much
I want to do many things that I can't do now while I am student
I went to England  when I was a high school student
There is a single, very long single path
I  have never seen a more beautiful place than there
I belong to the badminton circle,so I practice playing badminton once a week
I went to England two years ago,but I couldn`t comunicate with foreigners very well
I could also know the wonder of other countries
A tiring week
becauce practical training (is coming\/ will be coming
I'm writing a diary after a long time
There is a some news about me
I It was celebrated by my family and my friends
Many presents, many delicious dishes and happiness happy times
On Osyou-gatu, most part of Japanese have \"Osechi(お節)\" which is a traditional dish in Japan
This dish include many wishes what (?) is long life, to success business, to be blessed with children etc
Of cause course, I had Osechi cooked by my Mother
Beginning to learning English
I am beginning to learn English on today
Because I'll be working as a computer software engineer. about computer software
Many information about development software is written in English on the Internet
So I had thought that I want should to learn English."
I'm glad to have found this wonderful service on the Internet
I think I've got a lot of happiness
So, I have finished to cleaned my room
I couldn't have invited my friends over with my room in that condition
It was such a mess
Today, I went to a second-hand bookstore, but there was not the book which I hope to buy
instead, I bought some books without planning
Pay attention to the traffic accidents
I said that I'm going to write everyday, but I forgot about it right away・・・・lol
Well…today, Japan was buzzing with news of Osama bin Laden
It was from a junior high school student that I heard his name for the first time
Learning otheranother language is a joyful thing
This situationprocess of writing somea few letters in English to herethis site is just a little step of obtaining thethat pleasure
The imagination thought that someone will fix my mistakes and wrong incorrect grammer grammar makes me so excited
I need to knowa plenty of expressions and I believe that these practices will give me many changes tochances of getting learning some more of them."
By the way, in Australia the heavy rain brought a flood, causing damage
Children are soooooooooooooooo cute T.T
I majored in art
Currently I have a part time job at a child art institute
In Korean age, they are 4 to 10 years old
I think that children are cutest when they are around three to four years old
They have more pureness and straightforwardness
Today in the morning, my face is (really) puffy because I drank (heavily) last night
Then the cutest child came to me and looked at me for a long time
And she tilted her head as if questioning who this woman is
And then she silently <meta charset=\"utf-8\">left
Believe it or not, she scarcely recognized me
I went after her and asked her, who am I and how do I look today
She usually says “you’re pretty!” and I wanted to hear those words again
I wanted to deny that my face was puffy, so I wanted to hear that I was not ugly today
But she quietly said “you are
you look sleepy” (I didn’t open my eyes well because my eyes also puffy
That's why she thought I looked sleepy
I don’t want to write anymore
My eyes are still puffy from crying
We are really nothing in the universe Part 1
I didn't really know what to write about for my first Journal, soI decided to pick the first subject that came to my mind
Sometime when I watch the sky during my daily walk to University . I get this strange feeling inside of me, it's like I'm getting sick of something
I don't really know how to describe the this feeling, but it starts when I think about what lies beyond our solary system and how tiny we are
When I was a kid I always had an astronomy book in my hand, looking at pictures of the Giant Jupiter, Saturn and all of her their halos and learning about how the universe in general without understanding the whole proportion and concept behind it
But since I saw the Ultra Deep Field, taken by the Hubble telescope, my vision of the universe totaly changed
The number of galaxies was is so huge that I couldn't can't compare it to anything I knew know
I'm going to post this journal in multiple (several)parts, because I'm worried that it's going to be too long to correct
Japanese culture
This year, the year 2010
I want to start to learning about Japanese culture
For example, I want to learn how to put kimono on
Like japanese tea (ceremony?), or Japanese flower arrangement
Although I am Japanese, I don't know much aboutJapanese culture well
My grandmother had given me some kimonos, (had given seems more formal
but I don't know how to fold them! (wear them
I want to start enjoying japanese culture this year!"
I had no free time and I felt extremely bored, not just for  a moment, but all the day
I gave up  most of the time for \"studying
In the afternoon, I had to go school for the silly commencement exercises rehearsal
They  just had  us stay  in our seats and waiting
I had nothing  to do
To me, waiting is worse than working
After the rehearsal, I thought things  may go better
However, nothing  changed
I went to Tin Shui Wai for my Cantonese oral exam but I had to wait again
When I arrived  at the exam site, I thought it would  go very fast
Meanwhile, I could  have gone home and played  basketball
Sadly, I waited one hour for the exam to start  and used about 45 minutes to finish it
Finally,  obviously, I didn't have any time to do the   things that I had wanted to do while  I  was  bored  all  day
I had no idea that when will the weather would become better
I also had to pick up my wear lots of clothes on my body while before going to school like yesterday
Now,I'm getting more and more worried and worried
I am worried that I cannot get the good results and I am afraid that I will have no exit future if I make worst do badly in this exam
As I am the last year examinee in 2010 HKCEE,I have no take two second chance because the course will be changed after the this last HKCEE
Desperation is coming to me...I am getting desperate
I really don't know how to handle this desperation. my desperated emotion,even if I make my effort for inhibit it
The devil is suffering me.It's killing me
Does Can anyone can help me to run away from the hell?"
Liar game, which is a Japanese drama, is an interesting drama
If you haven't seen it, I suggest you to relish it as soon as you can
This drama is about a fight between intellect and intellect
And everyone in the game must lie to the others, and also not to be deceived by the others
There are many games in this drama and each game is an ordeal of intellect
Meanwhile, every game is psychological warfares
Now, I have watched season 1 & 2 of Liar games
And I'm looking forward to watching the final stage: Liar Game, the movie
Today was a Friday
And I woke up at 7 o'clock in the morning and prepared to go to school
In the time of studing at school, it's very hard to go through. It was tough in school today
Most of the school's\/lessons' time, I just continued writing and writing
Even I didn't even have time for a rest
I had communicated and chatted with the foreigners
I thought this was really an extremely good experience for me to improve my English level
Today was Monday, the first day to get through in every week
But, the first day is also the hardest day
Maths day. (I don't know how to correct some of these sentences because I don't know what A.Maths is - is it a course
Throughout the day, I spent a lot of my time to practicing and doing Maths and A
I was very tired from calculating those difficult questions
After the school bell rang, I really hoped that I could back to home for a rest
However, the reality is always cruel
I had to stay at school to make up a missed lesson in order to prepare for the HKCEE
I was extremely tired today
Stop hiding!\", I told myself
Although I don't know if I can do it or not
Or maybe I would give up quickly
However, starting now, I've told to myself that I must stop hiding
Just now, I realized that I was hiding in my imagination 
But I must stop hiding now
I must get out of this place, and be brave
I have to be more confident and face the reality
Also, I should try my best to tackle all difficulties
I must come out of my little world which is simply inside my brain
Maybe keep staying in this world is a very great thing but I realized that it wont help me
Maybe I can still try to escape the reality somehow, but now I know that I must come out
I know, I know that maybe I will give up and come back to my little world very soon, and it will be worse
But whatever, everything begins somewhere."
To talk about friends, all of us will easily associate with the people who give us the room to express our emotions
Meanwhile, they're the people who play with you, are happy for your happiness and sad for your sadness
I don't know wheather I'm too intellectual or I'm too ruthless
I want to know, I want to know it all
Maybe I'm just don't want to be too close to the others
Maybe my sense of self-protection is too strong
I can only be sure about one thing: sometimes I simply want to be alone."
It's been a long time since I last updated my diary
Since there was a very big exam that I had to focus on, I didn't have any time to do the other things
I can say that my exam is almost done because there is only the  oral exam remaining
In addition, I think I have to   start using  my online diary again
I have to keep training my English writing and make progress step by step
All of us choose to believe people who we are near to and we share our secrets with them, to unbearable emotions
However, I have chosen to believe someone that I don't know
Someone who I have never seen, and isn't very close to me
Since they are extremely close to me, I can't express all of my feelings and painful with them
I also can't share my secrets with them, even though I want to say speak out loud
Whenever I face them, I have to bear the desire to tell my secrets
And my unbelievable feelings appear
In my mind, I'm pretty sure they'll tell each other after I tell them my secrets
It's so easy to imagine that they'll tell everything to the classmates and their friends, although I don't want anyone know it
So, I won't have any private in the short run
Based on the above reasons, someone that I have ever seen before and is not very close to me is much better to believe
Since I don't know them and they don't study at school with me, I can express most of my feelings to them
I have no need to afraid that they'll tell the others because even if they do so, I won't be laughed by my classmates, like my friends, for instance
Meanwhile, I can keep things to myself
However, to be honest, I have never believed someone completely
But I have to say, it's much better for you to express yourself to someone who isn't your friends, parents
etc, even if they're not faithful to you
PS: \"Someone is always better to believe\" <<Sorry, I don't know what this means...>>"
What's a bad day
Needless to say and no selection for me,I had to wear a lot of clothes and make my effort to keep my body warm before I went to school
Yes,I had act was like a snowman today
Actually,I didn't know and don't understand that why my school couldn't provide the warm water to all of the students after they had finished their physiologically need
Say it easily To say it in another way,it means that after you have pissed
Imagine that you have just finished pissing. When you are going to wash and clean your hands,you have to let the COLD water run through your hands
What's the a 'great' feeling that is
The wind was blowing against my WET hands and I could feel my hands were shaking
Whatever,I know that I have to challenge the nature again tomorrow,even if I don't want to face it."
I have to start my school life and face the reality again in this week
But unfortunately, today is not a good day
Although I was already used to do the heavy homework, I got a bad, bad prediction today
Since we were going to face the HKCEE, my teachers gave us a ton  of school work, and of course, also homework
However, today my English teacher told us that we had to stay after school to do even more exercises
So, you could imagine that how busy we will be
To be honest, although I like studying English, I don't think this will help
For the whole day, we are doing exercises  on various  subjects
And you can understand how, if you do too much of the same kind of work, just continue training and training, you will be very tired and you won't be able to work up the enthusiasm
For these reasons, I think that this  will  maltreat us but not help us
I want to study in the foreign countries
I hope to study in the other countries, especially America or and England
It's because in these countries' school schools in these countries, I can learn my favourite subjects such as philosophy and design
However, the most important thing is, I can learn the English by talking to the people there."
I hate to be photographed
Topic: I hate to be photographed
And I hate to be photographed
However, there are always many people who want to take pictures of others and I'm one of the victims
Even if they all know I don't want to be photographed, they ignore the situation
Yes, they ignore my feelings
Also, I cannot understand why I must cooperate with my classmates and take photos with them
Why I must take them
I can just feel like  I'm in a jail
And my rights have been totally taken from me, even if it's  just a small right
Hello everyone! This is the first time that I write my diary in Lang-8 although since I have become one of the Lang-8's family members
Actually, I am just a simple teenager as same as all of you
And, I come from Hong Kong
My parents' language is Cantonese
However, I really want to improve my English by my very as best I can and be the a master of English
I am extremely hopeful that you can give your helping hands to me for correcting my writing mistakes in English
However, I didn't have any feel happy feeling
Not just a minute, is a whole day
I lost my way and I am perplexed
I have no idea that what way I how should I go on in my life
I knew that I had been choosing the wrong subjects
To say it more appropriate and clearly, no subjects are suitable for me because I am just interested in philosophy and design
However unfortunately, my school have no does not have these subjects and I hadn't chosen design
And I had chosen to learn science and I am now very regretful about it
I had tried to learn very hard in science but I am just cannot work up much the enthusiasm and get the good results
I believe that most of the people like playing online games
I always want to find some new online games to play
However, it is not easy to find a game that is interesting or I'm interested in it
For now, I want to find some online games from the foreign countries
But unfortunately, they are so difficult to find, even if I use a search engine such as yahoo or google
So, can you introduce some interesting and exciting online games to me
I want to speak english well
The first thing I'll write about in english will be ideas about sky
And a little about deers because I
I love them."
Eating Too Much
I ate two slices of bread with chocolate jam and drank a cup of coffee. (you can't say that you ate coffee
I'm still feeling hungry. After that, then I ate rice with boiled egg and chicken soup
Now I feel so full and I am very sleepy now. (\"Felt\" is only used for past tense. For the actions in present, you should use \"feel\")"
Today, I went to campus to study with my friends for my final exam
My final exams will start tomorrow; first is electrochemistry
I have learned about electroplating, electrolysis plating, electro-refining, electrowinning, physical vapor deposition, and many more topics
After I finsihed my homework, I switched on the TV to watch infotainment news
Most of the news were about divorcing
What a boring news
At 7.30 I took a shower and I was ready to go to the campus at 8.00
I arrived at the campus at 8.30
My friends were looked so tired doing drawing assignment
and I joined to them."
It must be very delicious because i hadn't havn't been eating chocolate since for a month ago
I have three friends  named Dennie, Anne, and Fauzi
What should I do
After physics class, my friend asked me to help him with the election booth
But I had already made a promised to my friends to do our assignment together
I have a responsibility to help at the booth because it is my shift, but my assignment deadline is soon
I am confused
I am university student and have doing part time job as a private teacher
I started doing my part time job My occupation as a private teacher started on December last year and I got the information about the vacancy from my friend, who also a private teacher too.You can use \"also\" or \"too\" not both in one sentence 
On At the first, I only had to teach a 3rd-grade-junior high school student who had to pass the national exam on April 2011
I was nervous on that day. because I didn't know why I was called and what topic that her mom want to talked, etc.It is not natural to use \"etc\" here
And finally I came and we talked, she just asked me to come more often and also helped her to teach her 5th-grade-elementary school daughter and would arise my payment too
I came to their home not only for teaching but also to be their friend
The exam had been passed and the result was very fantastic for me who is the beginner, for the newbie teacher
My first student was graduated with high score on Math and English, and my second student had her scores on her report increased
From the previous experience in teaching, now I have some students
3 students of 6th grade of elementary students study in my house 3 days a week and I teach another 6th grade of elementary and 1st grade student of senior high school in her house 3 days a week too
I start doing this on holiday, but I am not quite sure to do this when my holiday is over
I am now 3rd year university\/junior student and desire to graduate as soon as possible.1st year = freshman2nd year = sophomore3rd year = junior4th year = senior
So I have to finish my final project of bachelor thesis, final report, and also get good GPA on my last semester
Hello
I've just joined lang-8
Please let me introduce myself here
I'm Jin, a 19-year-old man living in Japan
I'm a very lucky person
At first, I was in trouble
Many of my co-woker co-workers helped me to leran learn the new system 
They taught me kindly and speaking spoke slowly
I'm very lucky person working with them.(or I'm very lucky person to be able to work with them
Because all of my co-worker is co-workers are not Japanease Japanese
I said \"Thank you very much, I'm very appreciative of  it \". (or say: I appreciate it
But, I want to lean onother learn another way
Are there any good words in English
Could somebody teach me
Hot springs
I 'd like travelling
I have been to many countries. (注意：\"went\"という使い方は別の休みを描く時に使えることが出来ます。例えば、\"On last year's holiday to Europe, I went to many famous churches\".でも、その経験があるだけと言いたかったら、\"have been\"を使った方がいいです。例えば、\"I have been to many Asian countries\" or \"I have been to many zoos around the world
I like hot springs, so when I go to other countries, I ofhen visit their hot springs
I think the temperature at JAPAN's hot springs are hotter than those in other countries."
The turmoil in the Ivory Coast
The former president of the Ivory Coast refused to step down after he lost the presidential election recently
Millions of people all over the world witnessed this absurd political drama; and unfortunately it resulted in tragedy for those people who were injured or lost their lives
New Year's Resolution
It's been 6 days since I returned from France
Nothing has changed here except that the visibility is getting lower because of the sand traveling from the desert
I can even feel the sand between my teeth when I inhale
It means a sand storm is on the way
My English teacher once told me that an ambitious person only needs one resolution in his life while a person without ambition needs resolution every day
I just knew that I wasn't that kind of person with ambition
I don't even make a plan for a week, let alone one for a lifetime
Live life, make it simple
That's my philosophy which is also why I am now in the middle of nowhere, lol
I just wish for things to be different in 2011, but i also know it will be just like other years
Things won't be different because you celebrated the last day of the year with a bunch of strangers drinking champagne
No new year's resolution for me, because i know i won't make it
Call me lazy, call me a pessimist
I want to know English. My dream  is to  studiy in a British university
I am only 14 years old, and I dont speak English well
I watch movie in English and read books, but it doesn't help me
So I want to make friends with people from another counrty
Lots of my friends in Japan have an account on mixi in Japan
I do not have one though
I am just wondering what kind of site it is
Also, one of my friends in Canada wants to have a mixi account, but is it possible
I definitely want you to be correct my diary for sure, but I would also like to know the answer to my question
Thank you."

I've been studying English for many years, and I have a plans to go abroad next month to improve my English
I got my English exam results last time, I didn't get a high score like i thought I would
I expected

Today was a very busy day
I had a job interview in the morning. (You can also say \"I had a job interview this morning
I got asked the many questions by from two men (maybe representatives of the company
I was nervous at the time
But I thought I was good well. -> \"I thought it went well.\" or \"I thought I did well
The salary of the company is very good. --> More natural: \"The company's salary is very good.\" Even better: \"The company offers a very good salary
It's better than my current job
The company said, \"We will call you tomorrow.\" or The company said that they will call me tomorrow
And then, I went to Chenan because of a business trip. --> \"for a business trip\" sounds natural here
Today, I took the bus for 7hous!!I rode the bus for 7 hours today!! 
I'm so tired
Furthermore I'm going to my company tomorrow!'Furthermore' sounds very formal, but everything else is more casual. So 'Additionally,' or 'Not only that, but' or 'Plus,' sound more natural
I'm sad~ I wanna have a break.~ is adorable and used often in Korean, but it's not used in English. (Well, those of us who learn Korean use it because it's so cute :) but normally we don't use it. Instead, '...' would work the same way ^^)"
I worried about one thing. something I'm worrying about
I hadhave a new job though I'm working now
I need a successor who workscan do my business
I promised the company I'll go to work next Wednesday
But I might not be able to go on that date
I have an trouble between curren job and future jobin going to work in new company
I called my future boss just beforenow
But the person in chare chair was not there, so I waite for company's call
I'm feel very worried about that
I want to bring this to an end."
I hate my homework. 
I'm going to go to the Culcom institute today
The Culcom institute helps people improve their English skills
Many foreigners and Korean go there to study English conversation
I joined a study group so I have to memorize some kind of story
But I don't want to do that
My boss is angry because I quit my job without notification. You haven't talked about your job yet, so you can't use \"this
I want to do solve this situation
1st Anniversary
Yesterday was my boyfriend and I's first anniversary. (I am sorry I'm not 100% percent sure with this correction
I couldn't believe that it had been one year already
We met at the movie theater, it was the spot of our first date
I didn't particularly like him at the time
But I love him so much now! 
Ashely is a famous, Korean family restaurant
We ate steak and went to the salad buffet
It was so nice and tasty
Also, the atmosphere was good
I was very impressed
The reason he gave me an alarm was because he worried about my way home. (He should've offered to take you home, girl
I'm in love! ^^ (Or maybe you were going for...) I feel so lovey-dovey! 
I want our love to last."
We had very busy week last week
I was supposed to go to his university because he had a class
We had a dinner after we met
It tasted very good. blue = suggestion"
The Skewered Lamb
We hadn't seen each other for 6 month
She was recommended some restaurants
I've never eaten lamb
It was my first time. (This is redundant...there's no need for it
Its smell was a little strange
But it was okay
And I also met her lover
He loves that sort of food. (You used \"there\" to show distance, so you need \"that\" to show distance as well. You need \"sort of\" to show that he hasn't been to the restaurant before
Have you ever eaten the skewered lamb
My freind friend Sunyoung, lived in Newzealand who lives in New Zealand, told me that Her lover and She she and her lover are going to marry on the 23rd
of Feb
But He he is very kind and polite
I got the call from the company I visited yesterday

This is my first entry to Lang-8
My name is Yasu
I am urged to improve my writing, since I am having taking IELTS test next week
I took a mock test today., however, t The result was terrible
I understood understand that the key to advance it improvement is simply writing a lot, making mistakes
Though I can read many words, when it comes to writing it, I don't can't come up with them
To get high scores, it is crucial to use know more expressions than I have know now, as well as logical structure
I don't know how to use Lang-8 or have and make friends here in lang-8 well, as I have just registered
Anyway, I will submit this now."
How do you, people, think, guys, is there such a thing as the Russian soul? (word order
Some kind of a national character trait
I have talked about it with foreigners twice
The first time it was a German guy, he had been seeing a russian girl from Sankt-Petersburg before our conversation, but they had broken down split up
But now although life is not as difficult, people are used to staying together to survive, and they don't feel themselves as independent as people of other nationalities do
Another conversation happened occurred with Swedish guy, who is fond of Russia and whose dream is to immigrate here
We were talking about different writers and he mentioned Bulgakov, I said Bulgakov is a Russian writer, he was surprised and asked me \"Really\", I answered \"OF COURSE
According to his opinion him (or In his opinion)(and I agree with him) that feeling of superiority is very typical for Russians ( for example, OF COURSE all famous writers are Russians)))) but it is mixed with the feeling of insignificance of themselves -- such a paradox
That's just two features, two pieces of conversations I've had about \"Russian soul\"."
my first \"hi-to-everybody\" here
Hi to everybody 
I wanna write this first post about myself and my relationships with english. (Опускание существительного - чисто русская ошибка. Они обязательны в англоречи - тк у них нет окончаний для контроля смысла, у них он строится на четком построении предложения
First time I got interested in it was when I studyed at school and joined an english study group
We read different books by English and American writers and discussed them from different points of view
Maugham, who is now one of my favourite writers 
And there I read \"The Catcher in the Rye\" by J
Salinger in English (I had read it in Russian before ( don't forget those capital letters for nationalities ;) ) and loved it very much
But I was a complete fool in grammar back then, so I couldn't express my thoughts the way I wanted it
Then, a few years later, I went to Germany by through international exchange, there I had to communicate in english cause my german was even worse than my english, and my language barrier was broken there 
And the third point, I've decided that the best way to learn something is to explain it to someone else
I have started teaching young children and then adolscents english and finally got to know and learned something about english grammar
Prepositions and phrasal verbs - that's what is driving me crazy now %)"
Last week, I made the panel for a PC case with a special tool (like in the pictures
I used acrylic, LEDs, some connectors, and some electronic parts
First, designing the panel with a PC application
Next, cut the acrylic board with an \"Auto cutting machine\". \/\/ I think, the tool is called either a \"drill\" or a \"milling machine\", but I'm not sure
And then, mount some LEDs and connectors
This is first time I'm writing on \" Lang -8
I'm DenDen from Japan
I want to learn English and to communicate with other people
Living in Japan
Major in college is Robotics
Love watching movies, reading books, comics, making PCs, listening to music, making Robots!"
Eating ice-cream, taking photos, and talking to nice people
It can't be my diary
This school year I'll seriously try and learn it
I see films in English with subtitles, but I can't copy the accents in the speech
Now I need to pay attention to construction of sentences and phrases
I need to fix it in my texts on random topics
I love for comics."
Schedule for tommorrow
At First, I plan to visit the dentist tomorrow
Next, I'll go to get a haircut
Further plans are undecided
If I understood English well, I would be able to read many more interesting books
Or, I would be able to tell other people interesting points of Japanese
That is why I learn English
 Valentine's Day
It was a Valentine's Day yesterday. So my child and I baked a chocolate cake
Of course, we gave my husband a chocolate cake
The first one I made"
My summer is coming to the an end
I will go back to school soon, and I think it will be busy next term
I know I will start to learn French, which may be somewhat interesting anyway
But it was fine yesterday. Better way: The weather was fine yesterday, but it is raining now
Actually, I had have tried to make cake before, but i have never succeed
And when my girl friend asked me to do this with her, I thought i I should try again anyway
Making the Ice cream was not that as complicated as we had imagined
Although We did have a rough time preparing for the cake
But guess what? <- that doesn't fit here The bottom was burnt,which really let me down
And what about as for the ice cream? I do not know
Hopefully,I will see what it is like from the picture
I Hope it will be better than the cake at least."
I'm just saying hi to everybody
So just leave your message to me,then I'll add youof my friends
 More freetime  to students! D
In Korea, most highschool students go back  home at 10 PM
So am I
There is no liesure time on weekdays
I love watching dramas like Doctor Who, Sherlok and the Big Bang Theory
but I  can only  watch these dramas during the weekend only
It is horrible to restraint myself from watching dramas
And there are so many pressures about studying
Nobody loves to study the whole day
Many animals have lost their own habitats
Lately in Korea many enviornmental problems have occured becuase of Four River Project. 
the government said it will be helpful to Korea's economy
But many people did not agree with the government because they think it will be useless. 
The government also says that this will become a tourist attraction, but it will not. 
They destroyed famous places with great natural landscapes and also drove many animals and plants from their own habitats. 
The government did not care about the people's complaints because of the benefits. 
I want more people in the world to know about this and become interested in it. 
I received 2 scam messages in a week XD
Hi :) Have you ever received scam messages in Lang-8
I think it's a big problem, I received two scam messages in a week
although it's not true what they said, their story is pretty good XD
their names are Nancy Nelson and Joy Beko
I was talking to them sincerely XD
after found out they were scam, I felt depressed and angry
they played a trick on me
I hope you guys won't be stupid like me D
I bought a Smartphone last month
It's really amazing, I can't stop to play playing with this
Anyway, I was wondering is there an App where I con write journals on lang-8
If a Lang-8 app were to exist, I would feel comfortable writing journals at school
Is there only one way that I can write journal's on lang-8?"
Social Networks make my world bigger. 
Lately, many people are connected by social networks and messengers
 I use Twitter, Facebook, Nateon and Skype, to connect with people around the world
I think it's really worth to preserve what I did and what I'm thinking. ( I don't understand) Hmmm do you mean to say : \"I think it's amazing to be able to document what I did throughout the day and what I'm thinking.\" (?) 
And by doing so, I am able to make new friendships (relationships
It's funny to find out different things between foreigners and myself
Somethings, the things I thought were true, were lies. 
Also they give me knowledge about other countries, that I didn't know about before
literally making my world bigger
The importance of motivation. 
I found an old note with some famous English quotes on it. 
Maybe it is notes about English. 
There are so many useful quotes like
The time when you think it's late is perfect time to do it.' and ''The man without motivation is not different from dead body
Anyway, after I saw this note I have been thinking about my motivation with my English studies. 
It's really quite simple
I'm studying English by playing a game that is not in Korean. 
Although this is useless motivation, It is a really important reason why I'm studying English
Why did you started to learn another language
Before I joined the Lang-8 community, I was just interested in English and Japanese. (or Before I started using Lang-8, ~) 
I just interested in English and Japanese
But (or However,) since I started using Lang-8, (or since I joined Lang-8,) I want to learn so many foreign languages, not only English and Japanese, but also French, Germany, some other languages. (wanna is okay but kind of slang 
I wanna learn so many foreign languages
not only English and Japanese, but also French, Germany, some other languages
But (or However,) it looks hard to learn these languages, so I decided to buy some language books after my exams are over
so I decide to buy some language books after my exam has over
and I'll study some Chinese characters to read Japanese words
It's hard to read them 
I need to study more!!"
My mid-term exams finished today
From Wednesday to Saturday, it was a very hard time
Also, my results are horrible
Every student was regreted the test
Every test's level of difficulty was very hard
Especially, two that were on the subject of math were really really hard
I hope I can get better results on our next exam.0"
aw..... I watched a terrible video clip
It's not something grotesque or gore

she is so cruel
I hope she will be punished by the law
Lately I used my laptop because my desktop broke after the blackout
After school vacation (do you mean \"after summer vacation\" or \"during summer vacation\"?), my life cycle was terrible 
if I had time to rest, I played with my laptop
So yesterday, I decided to fix my desktop
I'm so happy that I escaped from that bad life cycle :D
but I still don't study XD"
Laptops make people lazy
Lately, because of the blackout my desktop has been broken, so I decided to use a laptop
so I decided to use laptop
indeed, I hate to use the laptop because it makes me lazy
I use the laptop on my bed, I surf the internet, and finally I watch dramas
it makes me NOT STUDY, and NOT EXERCISE
I was looking forward to joining this joinning that site for a long time
Please correct my diary have my dialy corrected
Now I'm listening to Utada's songs.Alternatively: Now I'm listening to a song by Utada. You could also say \"a Utada song,\" but that would make \"Utada\" a describing word and would only sound natural if the listener knew of Utada.Remember: always specify whether a noun is plural or singular where ambiguous, and use \"a\" or \"the\" in the singular case. The way you wrote it suggests not only that your listening to one song, but that Utada has only one song
I have loved her songs all my life, since she debuted
Nevertheless she is not famous in the USA.It's probably weird, but even though it's a name, it's still a phrase, and you still need \"the\" to describe the word \"states\". "
Can you correct my text
I don't like rainy season in Japan, because it is very high humid indeed."
She is a Hong Kong girl who is studying in a japanese college

Could you listened her song
This is a Japanese anime song covered by her
It is about a young girl who desires to grow up as a women
Meh, I am not good at writing in English :P"
An intruder
I have some filipino friends at my workplace
One day, when a women said \"つばめが入ってきた,\" (\"a swallow came in\"),You can't put anything in your friend's quote except what she literally said, unless it's in brackets. Honestly, I'm not sure if you should write all in one quote with the English in brackets, or use two quotes as above. I actually mentally placed the quotation mark right after the Japanese without realizing. So I thought at first that a swallow really did come in when she said that, which made the story sound very fantastical until I'd realized my error
My friend had been quite surprised 
At that, she was so became weird and very nervous
Then she asked me, \"what is 'つばめ'?\".Or: Then she asked me what \"つばめ\" was.It would technically be correct to say Then she asked me what was \"つばめ\". But this doesn't sound natural, since \"what is\" or \"what was\" coming before つばめ sound like it's the beginning of a question that the woman asked
I answered that it is a swallow,(space)but she could not understand it.Remember that when you use a word like \"it\" it's just a place-holder for a word you don't want to use again. Here \"it\" doesn't really refer to anything other than your answer, but the word \"answer\" isn't actually used. If you had said \"My answer was that it[the bird] was a swallow, but she could not understand it[the swallow].\" The hard part is figuring out how many \"it\"s you can use before you don't know what each of them mean. Hahaha. :P
I reflected for a while and talked to her. \"It is a bird\". Two sentences here, and it might be better to put to use '\"It is a bird,\" I said.' for the second sentence. The \"I said\" can go before or after the quote, but it sounds more artful to not put \"I\", or the same word, at the beginning of subsequent sentences.You can also say \"I reflected for a while and told her that it was a bird
She seemed to understand and to feel easy. You're right that you could leave the second \"to\" out, but it sounds to me like \"seemed\" might only describe her understanding, not her feeling easy. If read that way, it would mean \"She seemed to understand and she felt easy.\" In this case, \"feel\" would have to be \"felt,\" so that it would be in the same tense as \"seemed.\" だから、「to」が要ります。
Nevertheless, she had a bird. Who is \"she\"? \"She\" up until now has been your friend, but she doesn't have the bird, does she? She didn't understand that there was a bird, so this could only be the case if the woman who said that a swallow came in both: 1)kept the swallow, and 2)lives with the other woman who didn't understand that there was now a bird in her house. :P"
Today,I gathered the big onions that ware were planted last November in my garden
My hands have a smell of onion since I had touched them onions
You may think that it is a unique smell. Personally, that I don't really dislike so much
By the way,I will plant some Allium Chinenses this autumn
Then I will make pickled Chinenses pikles and eat that them with curry
Somehow in Japan ,they are served in curry
Well, why are languages so difficult

The KannagiIt's probably confusing, but titles in English don't always have a \"the\" or \"a.\" You could translate the anime \"The Kannagi,\" but Kanagi is perhaps the main character's full name as well. そのアニメで「なぎ」ですね？And the English title for this anime is actually \"Kanagi: Crazy Shrine Maidens
I am watching the Kannagi on PC.ややこしいね。「over the phone」 って、でも「on the internet; on tv; on my PC」。\"My,\" \"a\" or \"the\" can be omitted when you say \"on\/with\/by 何々\" sometimes. But maybe it's best to learn this case-by-case. It's okay either way here. You can also say: \"via PC,\" and \"via\" is pretty impressive English, since it's not used in conversation often
It is supposed to be a story about the gods inof japan and a mere nymph-anime.but is simply a bishojo anime. (people understand this anime as bishojo. http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bish%C5%8Djo) 
I can't look up find the translation of 美少女アニメ with in English
I found it the anime on the web and I'm watching it. and that It has subtitles tickers in English and I can study English
I found it and am watching it on the web, and because it has subtitles in English, I can study.Immediately repeating a word can sound unnatural in English, so I cut out the second \"English,\" since it can be inferred. The next sentence would sound a bit more natural with two \"English\"s since they're farther apart
I'm watching the anime I found kannagi is found on the web, and that, with the English-tichkers subtitles are useful for studying English
Which is more natural
It is so difficult that I can't translate the Japanese sentence into an English one
I guess I use difficult grammars in Japanese or put away something for writing English. ??\"Grammars\" isn't a word. I think the second part of this sentence was supposed to mean \"or I should delete cut out some things when writing English.\" But I didn't know why you said \"or
In conclusion, languages are very difficult.\"Nevertheless\" means \"それでも\" or \"ですが\" and should only be used when you will contradict what you just said previously. \"In conclusion,\" by the way, is very cliché, but it would sound good if you were being funny and pretending to act professional."

After the earthquake in the East Japan, Japan has had many many problems
There's no foods, no erectricity, no gasorine
In Gunma prefecture, the damage by the earthquake isn't so bad
but we don't have enough gasorine
So we must line up to get gasorine
It takes a long time
Roads are crowded all day long and
the traffic lights don't work during the blackouts
It is very dangerous for everyone
Food isn't enough either
We can't buy a cup noodle at the supermarket
Cup noodle, bread, milk, yogurt are always sold out
Is Japan over
It looks like during a war
I can't imagine a vision of Japanese future
We met at Kita-kamakura station and went to Kencho-ji temple (famous for Kenchin-jiru – a soy sauce soup with many vegetables, tofu and konjac). From through this temple we entered the hiking trail
After one hour, we arrived at the top of Oohira-yama, we and enjoyed the scenery there
And in Touge-no-Chaya (a rest house), I ate oden (a Japanese food made up of several fish meat pastes, tofu, konjac, egg in soy sauce soup
After walking for about an hour, we reached Kamakura-hachimangu shrine, then walked down Komachi-dori street to Kamakura station
Komachi-dori street was terribly crowded, so we gave up trying to eat lunch there

I found this site lately and I'm getting hooked on. または i'm getting hooked on lang-8
I have tried to read and correct many dairies as much as possible during my free time
I have gotten so much&nbsp;stimulation&nbsp;from the people here
I was encouraged just reading in
At the same time, I can help someone who want to improve their Japanese abilities, and that always makes me feel better
I would like to find my best language exchange partners soon on Skype too
I will write a lot of entries and hope that friends from lang-8 can correct my sentences

Today, I'm in Hong-Kong on a trip
I think, Hong-Kong is a good to city to live in for Japanese people
Because the food tastes good, it has good security, and is very near to Japan
But this isn't a good city for sightseeing
Hong-Kong looks like almost the same as Osaka in Japan
So, Hong-Kong has no surprising points for Japanese people
In any case, I like Hong-Kong
Because the people are very kind
Challenge
Today, I started lang8. [use a space between a comma and the next word
My goal is to use English for business and to communicate with foreign friends
So, I write a post on lang8. [You don't write a diary on lang8. You write in a diary, or you write an entry or a post
The theme of my diary is diet
Go diet
Go studying English!"
Nowadays, almost all Japanese people think Japan's future will be very bad
We have sadly pessimistic forecasts
The population is decreasing and the GDP is not rising
But,I am taught that Japan is a good country by the people living in Hong Kong
In fact,we don't have afford may not be able to rise bring up our economy, but we have a good culture, security ,hospitality and so on
If we know how to delivery our strong points for to the world people,Japan will be a more attractive country
For example, a Japanese cultuer seminar speaking with that invited Chinese guests in during summer vacation
Game Creator, world cup in Japan, and Hot Spring tour, and so on
I would like to make many foreigners come to Japan to do sightseeing,and welcome you any more time
Nowadays, I have found out three good methods of studying English
First, speaking and checking it by myself. Then, wright writing my ideas in Engilsh on Lang8. And finally, reading magazines written by in English
The first thing is done with a voice recorder
Sometimes, I feel pessimistic by because of my bad pronunciation
The second thing is depended on by you, thank you
My brain is thinking in English during while writing on Lang8
The third thing, with reading soccer magazines, is very fan fun for me
There are many words I don't know, but I image imagine the meanings of these words
It is 1:30am \/ midnight in Japan now. [midnight = 12.00
So I'm beginning to write a diary in English and I want friends who speak English as their native language.

Recently, I participate in an English conversation class every Friday. I participated in an English conversation class, recently
I had many things to talk about, but I always feel so nervous since I can't speak well in English
I want to remove my mental block, open my mind, and be aggressive!"
Our speaking and writing ability is not as good as our reading
We memorized a lot of English word and grammars at the school
We should learn how to express our thoughts with simple English."
The bus was almost fulled
I met a friend at Shinjyuku at first
It was the hottest day, and I was lucky that the inside of art museum was cooler than outside
I felt relaxed taking my time to see many beautiful paintings. taking a time
We had lunch at a Spanish restaurant near the museum, as there were some people waiting for the tables at the restaurant in the museum
She had reserved a table in Izakaya
After eating, we went to a Salsa lesson
Lately, I haven't practiced Salsa, but I enjoyed it because there were nice people to lead me
I didn't get drunk at all
I must be strong to alcohol. (This is kind of like an exagerration, but it sounds better than may be. Like \"Haha, I must be strong to alcohol, I didn't get drunk at all
I stayed at her place that night
I will talk about last Sunday, too. (the next day)"
I check my mail and this site every day
I also like to read people's ideas about daily life
Today I was wondering why I am taken up by reading diaries and correcting them
It happened to remind me
I was working at a newspaper company
I typed up a lot of manuscripts after some journalists wrote articles
Before publishing them, I had the opportunity to read interesting news on the spot
So I love to read non fiction such as news, documents, and life stories based on reality
I like to communicate with people, not only by talking with them but also through writting down ideas
I think it is easier to catch the get a sense of their personality through writing, and I am deeply affected by it
In Japan, Japanese female like to think about blood type. (space in between \"Japan, Japanese\") 
There are some fortunetelling, such as palm reading, card reading, horoscope and so on
In your country, what is the most popular about way of fortune telling?"
I feel a long ways away from talking to people in Spanish. OR I feel I have a long way to go before I can talk to people in Spanish. (The first example is somewhat informal, and \"a long ways away\" is probably not \"proper\" English, but I have heard this expression before
When I practice Spanish, the words do not come out of my mouth easily, and I often come up English words instead
My brain seems to be full of English and there is no room for any other languages. OR My brain seems to be full of English and there is no room for anything else
I feel foolish. OR I feel like a fool."
Last Saturday, I went to eat out with my neighbours
We went to a Japanese restaurant this time
We had one of typical Japanese seasonal dish(松茸土瓶蒸し
with sasimi ( raw fish), crab, tenpura and so on
I ate too much, but I believe that the total calorie is low
Does this mean: \"I've just been thinking about the idea of breaking up with someone.\" OR\"I've been thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend
When people have to break up with someone, what kind of things do they do
They fight, swear and argue with each other
Those kinds of things seem very unbearable
In my experience, I've always avoided fighting and swearing at each other
 This is the case not with men but with friendships as well
Lately, I've started to think I should have discussed the matter in detail because I could have let the person know what the problem was
I think it would have made the person more mature
Otherwise I regret that I didn't say anything
I'll try to do that in the future."
This morning I had a tennis lesson
I usually have it every Tuesday
I really like playing tennis in groups
I have two instructors,one is a man and the other is a woman
The female instructor is very nice
I appreciate her effort and advice
My male instructor is very strict
Please give me your advice
More than 5 years ago,I had a female friend  who lived in Japan and taught English to Japanese people
One day, I went to pick her up at her place
I thought she seems seemed to be very tired
She suddenly said to me, \"My boyfriend dumped me
I was very supprised to hear that
She continued to say, \"we broke up
At that time I didn't say anything for to her
I wish I had more English ability to encourage her. I would like you to correct this diary as usual
I also would like to ask all my Lang8 friends about this situation
Do you have some good expressions to say to your friend who broke up with her boyfriend
It seems like my friend was very sleepy and didn't want to get up. soon
I opened the curtain a little cause the room was dark and I didn't want to wake her up. my friend up. (\"my friend\" is still right but it probably sounds better with \"her up\" because the reader knows who you are talking about and the word \"friend\" becomes less repetitive
I was reading a book for a while. (I presume your are reading one book
Finally she got up, toasted bread and made coffee for me. OR When my friend got up she toasted bread and made coffee for me. (Usually it's best not to start with the word \"And\" when we write, however it is acceptable when we speak. I used \"my friend\" to avoid repeating the word \"she
After having breakfast, We went to Ebisu (one of the city in Tokyo
The exbition was \"Look at me
It was theme around photographs of nude portraits. \"The photos were depicted various emmotions and relationships
First I thought there were many pohotographs which were depicted beautiful curves of object figures. of the object
I noticed there were many individuality or personality in this photographic exhibition which kind of made it unique
It was nice a experience for me
After seeing the art, we enjoyed the stage show which was performed by amature musicians outside
How nice was it exploring in Tokyo? OR It was nice exploring Tokyo and was a perfectly refreshing day for me
I finished to watching a Japanese drama on Youtube today
The drama had 10 episodes

I like the Japanese actors Takizawa and Fukada. who are Japanese actors
It doesn't cause any problems
I am can be happy when watching dramas."
I watched a Japanese drama called 流れ星 tonight
Today, was the climax of the drama was climax and I was very moved so much
So I desparately wanted to write about it in my diary
Some One girl was attempting suiscide, while another girl needs an organ to be remain alive
Their lives are intertwined with ( twisted around) each other
PS which is suitable expression? \"Intertwined with\" is a good expression to use here. Alternatively, you could say \"Interconnected with

Olympic Games
Do you all watch The Olympic Games on TV or even in Vancouver
I watch them on TV
I was watching The Mogul Games yesterday
I think that Japanese athlete Aiko Uemura did her best
She did a great job, but unexpectedly, she was fourth place
Actually, I was impressed by the American skier  who got first place
She was perfect. She was very fast and performed beautifully
She showed us her dynamic movements
Bravo
She deserves the gold medal!"
I enjoy watching Prison Break final on TV every Tuesday
I usually recorded it because the show is starts late to start
This Tuesday, I forgot to record it
I am disappointed with in my forgetfulness
Today I had a chatting session with my friend on Skype
We sent messages to each other on the spot. on the real time
So I had some wrong spelling mistakes
I did wrong spellings a lot. 
Or I spelled a lot of  words wrongly. (I don't know the proper grammar of my own language, but most people just say \"I spelled a lot of words wrong
Or I typed wrong spellings a lot
Actually, I  enjoy chatting with her and  I hope we had enough time to talk
The time difference is makes it difficult to find the right time to talk to each other."
Yesterday I played tennis with some members of the tennis club (or gym??) for about 7 hours
I have a little mascular pain on my body. I'm a little sore
Today is my I'm relaxing time at home
In On the program, it usually shows the great ways to cook. (or \"great recipes
It helps me a lot to cook for healthily and it takes only the a short time
I like to cook delicious and healthy meals, not taking so long time that are quick to make
In On the program, some guest, like an actor or actress, comes and have a to chat
I like the situation as they show their actual face true colors, I think. (\"True colors\" is a set phrase meaning \"true personality.\") 
I notice the colored leaves little by little. (I notice the leaves changing color, little by little
At the same time, I feel like I am missing (something), somehow. (Or do you mean) At the same time, I feel like something is missing, somehow. 昨日、私はよこさんと話していたとき、よこさんは「さびしい」と言いました。この文章に「さびしい」を使ったら、次の英訳になるかもしれません：At the same time, I feel lonely, somehow. Or At the same time, it feels lonely, somehow
Do you get the same feelings like me
I saw a movie with the title,  魅せられて, on cinema program on TV today
This is an American movie, but the location is in Italy. (...but it takes place in Italy
The scenes are beautiful
The actors are attractive and play their roles well

I will talk about my way to avoid the hottest days
I'm hooked on seeing the movies at home
I want to avoid having a heat attack
SolatelyI see lots of movies at home during the day
When I am very moved by some scenes, I get gooss bumps and I can't stop my tears
It is no problem when watching movies alone at home, 
but it isembarrassing for me to cry a lot in front of people at the movie theater
So I enjoy seeing the movies at home, I feel like being left alone so I can focus on watching the movies
Another way I avoid the hottest days, is to enjoy reading books inside
Besides that, I (also) have time to study English
That is great, isn't it
It is not so bad just to spenda few monthsinside
I am patient as I wait for Autumn
I would (like to?) visit some places
Maybe I will have a chance to walk around outside. (If I do,) I would visit some art museums in Tokyo and play tennis outside in my neighberhood."
My friends always send me a lot of nice photos and told me some of his\/her experiences there
There are also some nice spots to go bike riding
I want to visit her in the future
This summer was so hot, I avoided the strong sunlight during the daytime
I didn't really get sunburnt. (I think this sounds more natural
Japanese people usually say that Fall is the best time for tasting seasonal foods and appreciating arts
I enjoy the both of them
After eating various foods, I know I should exercise more
I want to avoid getting fat from the cold weather."
I am tired of these hottest days
I like summer the best, but it is too hot for doing things outside
The other day, my friend emailed me that she would go to see the riverside and swim there
I definetely wanted to join with her as I would avoid the hottest part of the day and I was bored just staying inside my house
He was a great driver in the narrow road heading for the river
We found the nice spot where some people were already enjoying the water
When we were ready to go there we changed clothes in his car. Some other people were leaving the spot
They already seemed to have spent a lot of time there
So we went there to soak ourselves: the situation is kind of like owning the nice spot ourselves
The stream in the river is a little bit strong, so we just enjoyed walking a little and soaking in the cold water
The cold water is comfortable for us
We didn't bring our swimming sandals, so we couldn't walk around because the bed of the river was very slippery
I was very happy to talk with my friends and watch the bright water splash
I had a lot of fun adventuring in natural conditions
I really like appreciate the nature."
I'm happy because I like to cook the seasonal meal
After boiling chestnuts for a few minutes, I peel the skin off
I made rice with some chestnuts, seasoned with sweet sake, soysauce and salt
Before serving it, I sprinkle nori, sesami and salt
栗ご飯 This is a famous dish among Japanese people. ( I would mention this after your first sentence
It taste fresh and has a good flavor
When I see the cherry blossoms, it reminds me of the entrance ceremony
My father took the a photo of mine me. 
I looked very proud and was smiling
My father gets is getting older now
After his surgery, he gets is getting better gradually and he enjoys meeting people and playing shougi(将棋)at the community center now
I was very excited to see new people and I was wondering how it was going in school life would be
High school life of mine is my most unforgettable one. High school is one of my best memories."
I continue to talk about いきものがかりwho which is a music band
When I listen to the lyrics of Yell, I get emotioned emotional easily
Somehow I feel something I can't express well. I was genuinely moved
Once I start looking for the songs on YouTube, I just can't stop
At least I suggest that everyone can practice Japanese with Karaoke on You Tube
I got the feeling that every skaters performed very well and they showed their high techniques under all that pressures, many expectations
I liked Miki Andou's performance in the free skating
I was moved to see Joannie Rochette' tears after the short skate session
Mao Asada, the 19 year old captured the audience by completing a triple Axel successfully
In her interview, it seems like she was not satisfied with her free skating as she didn't get it perfectly executed
I think she has got  a strong technique and she will challenge the her competitors again
Kim Yu Na is very strong and performed her routine beautifully and perfectly
I like her performance in the short program
I haven't written a new entry because I had many things to do
Last month, I visited an art museum
I  had arranged to visit there with my friend
I was late to arrive at the museum because I got lost
Seeing the fine arts make me totally relaxed and it took me to the old days
It also guided me to places in Europe that I've never been to before
When I went to Paris, I didn't have a chance to visit surverb. (surverb is that a French name
I felt very romantic seeing some paintings. (maybe \"some of the painting were very romantic\" might be more natural
Last Sunday, I went to play tennis with some team members
After a few hours, it was getting warm, and the sunlight became strong in the afternoon
Today it was raining and it was cold again. (or \"Today was rainy
I think it is weird to have such fickle weather here and there
The law of  nature is getting messed up ?"
Now I'm enjoying seeing cherry blossoms here and there now
I always drive my car when I to go out and I can naturally see beautiful cherry blossoms along the street in some places. 
We I also enjoy seeing them in the parks, shrines, temples and bank along the river. (You didn't say who \"we\" is. If you are alone, don't use \"we
There are Cherry trees in line both sides of the road from the 甲府(Koufu)station all the way to takeda shrine
It seems a lot of cherry blossoms lead us the way to Takeda shrine
I will visit them and ask my mother to take a walk with me during this cherry blossom season. (\"This cherry blossom's season\" means only 1 blossom.)"
A recipe for a Japanese dish
Today, I will talk about one of my favorite Japanese dishes
I have many favorite Japanese dishes
Although it it is difficult for me to choose only 1 recipe, I think this is a good one to bring to a potluck party
Beef & Vegetable Rolls
Salt & Pepper ( a pinch
Spread oil on the cooking sheet of oven plate
Bake for 20 minutes, occasionally put soy sauce mixed with mirin on 
and the taste comes into the rolls very well
Serve them with tomatoes,lettuce or sliced cabbage
I hope you know or can imagine this dish."
It makes me happy to go outside easily
I will wait for summer
I think spring represents freshness and new beginnings in Japanese society
New grades are startng and new workers are joining the workplace
I feel like I'm more energised this time of the year."
Today I cooked {Boiled gut and liver of Chicken with soysauce and suger
This dish won an award in a Japanese competition this year
This is an original dish from Kofu city in Japan
I cooked it while looking at the recipe
I've cooked a similer dish before, but it is the first time I cooked this one
The way to cook this dish is very simple and it is delicious
This dish is has lots of sustainance and it is a nourishing meal
Olympic Games 2
I was wondering if Kokubo ( Japanese snow boarder) would performs very well
You may know it or not, but he causes a lot of controversy in Japan because of some for several reasons
But he did his best and got the 8th place
I expect he is has matured more and he has his future to challenge it do better next time
Aono ( Japanese boarder) also got the 9th place
They performed greatly well although they had a lot of pressures there
My　diary
It is the first time to Iwrite in the dialydiary in on this site
When iI was a junior high student,I used to write my diary  in Japanese and I quit
After that,I sometimes write my dialy diary in English
It's instructive  for me to memorize words
I think I am getting to used to speaking English naturally little by little
I'll keep it up."
Dramas and movies
Lately, I have (I've) been hooked on watching dramas and movies, because I can watch them on cinema program, which is on TV
I signed up for the trial subscription of Hikaritv net
The trial system lasts only for 1 month
So I feel like I have to watch as many programs as I can during this chance
At least I can take advantage of improving my listening skills, while enjoying the movies
I noticed that American movies (are filled with humor), and European and Asian movies have great story lines
My problem is, I can't stop watching them
Moreover, I have to be careful not to gain weight while staying in front of the TV all the time
hooked on\" and \"addicted to\" mean pretty much the same thing. Something you really like and crave for, and can't stop doing. (Just about the same meaning as when it is used to talk about drug or alcohol addictions. , caught up in, Which is more common to use?\"caught up in\" I see this as more of a temporal phrase. To be delayed, or hindered; \"I got caught up in a heavy storm on the way here.\" In comparison with the previous two, it can carry a little bit of both meanings; \"I got so caught up in his web of lies to the point where I would do anything for him\" (a little bit of dramatic sentence ^^;) In this case, the person was \"hooked\" on the lies that where being told, mainly because they didn't know they were being lied to. Also, this sentence the connotation of wasted time and\/or effort. She wasted time doing \"anything for him.\"sorry, I didn't mean to make the explanation so long and confusing
Which is more natural to say?For you entry, both hooked on and addicted to are good 
Some of my friends plan to go on a trip at the end of year
I get nerves, because I can't go traveling at this moment. Spelt it wrong
One of my friends, she is planning to Australia.Wow, I would be envious too
I wanna go there, I guess it is the in the middle of summer in Australia, the season is the oppsite of Japan
I like Summer the best,although we have to be careful not to get too much sunburned too much.You wrote it correctly, however 'too much' sounds more like a native speaker
Be careful not to get sunburned too much.正しいですよ。さすが！
He was a professional soccer player
I borrowed the book because I like him very much and it seem to be a good referencematerials to learn new expressions. (I usually use the word \"borrow\" when you don't have to pay for something to use and then return it. Whereas \"rent\" is more for something that you would pay and return. eg. \"I borrowed my friends pencil.\" \"I rented a DVD from the video shop
It seems like he express his thoughts in a natural way, it was straight forward
I admired his efforts and his potential talents as a professional player
He played the soccer matches with his clever strategy
After his own decision to retire from his career, he still has a  vision to help others using soccer as an encouragement for young players and children living in poor countries."
Nice to meet you! This is my first entry and I hope to not make too many mistakes right from the beginning
Tomorrow I will take an English exam, so I need to practice a bit
Let me briefly introduce myself., firt
I'm studying English at university, not just because it's an important language to know, but also because I really like it. (In American English, we typically say the full name of the University, or \"in college\" instead of \"at university\". British English allows this, though
My main interests are cooking, traveling, and listening to any kind of music, depending on my mood
I'm also interested in watching motocross road racing, although I don't ride a bike
Currently I don't play any sports
But When I was small I played many of them like dancing, swimming, skiing, palying volleyball, and tennis
Sadly, I had to quit because I didn't have enough time left to study
But Now that I'm a university student I can start again
After starting elementary school
I began to yearn for curly hair style, and to be a cute girl with pierced ears
At that time, there are were not many people who wear with pierced ears, even among adults around me
Of course I don't think anybody could have not imagined that the guys became would start to wear pierced earrings like a lady
Is it the same as in America
Even now, I still do not often see the young girls wearing pierced earrings in Japan
I think it is because of Japanese school rules
It seems they are getting more mild lenient when compared to my school days, but we still have a \"school rules\" in Japan
I will talk about what kind of school rules we had at my school in my next entry. 
Hi everyone, I would really appreciate it if you read my diary and your help me out :)"
As you know we have a school uniform in Japan, and we also usually wear a T-shirt or a camisole under the uniform
But ours had to be white in color
It was not acceptable to wear another color
Also we had a school shoes. Everyone had to wearing the exact same shoes with specified socks
Which had to be all white color or white with one or two top stripes
They checked out all of the students every month…
Why did we have to be wear the same things, and have to have the same hair style
But first I visited Paris by myself for 2nights…traveling alone for the first time was very lonely
It was not too bad more then I  though, but I always had to take food with me, and I was not able to share so many beautiful things
After that, my friends joined my trip, and made it more fun
Have you ever traveled by yourself?"
Did strict Japanese school rules make me a person with half of a brain
I believe that I was taught how important it is to have rules and follow a line to spend in many people with comfortable.---not sure what you mean here
16 years later, I began to finally understand it…
Looking back, it taught me about having common sense, which has been useful in my life. 
However at the time, I could not understand it
I wished I were an American girl and I could definitely wear stylish clothes to school and also have stylish hair
From that time, I began to have more of an interest in America than when I was younger."
You might have thought that I gave up this diary after three days.(We called it Mikkabouzu:三日坊主 in Japan
But no~, actually I was taking the weekend off
Today I will write about some Japanese school rules from when I was in junior high school
The memory still makes me laugh.(LOL
Boys: Clean-shaven head with maximum hair length of 7-8mm
I totally forgot the exact number of length, but I am sure it was under 1cm
Girls: If you have bangs, the length should be above the eyebrows
Also the length of your hair should be above your shoulders
Of course, whether you are a boy or a girl, you cannot have a perm or dyed hair
Especially I had a long hair since I had special permission. (I would put this sentence together with the next sentence like this: \"I was given special permission to have long hair because I had been learning traditional Ryukyu dance since I was 7 years old
My First Diary Entry
I have never written an English diary in my life, but I will try to keep writing and hopefully I'll polish my English skills at this opportunity
Why did I started to learn English
My aunt is married with to an American. She has visited my place in Japan for every year with fabulous gifts and sweets
I am just starting to have an interesting in America and thinking America is like my dream land
To be continued..."
Why was I interested in America
The fabulous gifts my aunt gave me from there were always so fantastic
 I had never seen any of them before in my life, such as an animal print bed cover be glow by electronic and lighter, colorful bathing suit etc....**not sure what you mean to say here: such as an animal print bed cover be glow by electronic and lighter
I only had an  ugly, dark-colored bathing suit that was called the \"school swim suit
When I was young, more than 20 years ago now, I don't think there were really any cute and fashionable clothes for children in Japan.  
So my colorful clothes were always my boast!-?? what do you mean to say here
Also some pictures she showed me from America were shocking
that Americans lived in big houses with fancy interiors
I was also surprised that the streets there were so wide
It was when I was 4 or 5 years old, at that point I had never seen any foreign movies
In the pictures, people had different colored eyes, hair and skin
it was so cute! They looked like dolls that I used to play with 
to be continued
クラスマッチ　is like the sports festival
But we lost
So I want to win the next game time."
You tolking talk to me please
They are the same age as me.Strictly speaking, \"me\" should be \"I\" in formal EnglishYou can also say \"They are as old as I am\" or\"We are the same age\" where \"we\" refers to you and your friends
Today,I played in my house with them.(Teenagers normally use \"hang out\" for spending time with friends.Children usually use \"play\".So,if you wanted to use \"hang out\",it'd be,\"Today,I hung out with them in my house
Finally I completed my chain mail.  (or you can say \"I finished making
Actually it is called a \"coif\", it's a kind of hat
I can't remember why I started to make it. (usually thinking verbs like think, feel, remember, etc. are present tense unless there is some distinction... for example... I couldn't remember why I started to make it, but now I remember
Anyway, my fingers are numb because I worked with almost my bare hands. (you can say \"my almost-bare hands\"... that means you were wearing very very thin gloves... but I think you mean \"I worked with my bare hands most of the time
I love making stuff. (if you don't use make+object, it sounds weird. you could say \"I love creating\" and it's okay
I especially like making medieval weapons or props from movies
I took the photo and sent it to my friend who lives in Tong-Young
As soon as she received the photo, she told me that she wants it
45 days later, the wand maker sent the wand to her
And that was on Wednesday
And I went to bed a little earlier than usual, about 10
I woke up at in the middle of the night, coughing
Actually, I didn't do any exercise for several months
Today, I went for an outing to a kind of theme park with my family.Perfect
Unexpectedly, there was a Japanese Drum Show.This is grammatically correct, but a little awkward. It would probably be better to say, \"We were surprised to see a Japanese Drum Show
The show was performed by Ondekoza., 
which is one of the famous Japanese Drum performanerce groups in Japan.Alternatively, you could say \"Japanese drum performing groups
Anyway, It was nice to listen to the drum sound outside
If you look at each Katakana, you can find letters which shows the pronunciation of the word
Then I was inspired by those fonts and created \"TREE\" font
without any help
long time no see^^haha
4 months have passed since I came here
We rode many attractions and screamed a lot
However it was closed for testing
So I want to ride that when I go there next
Today, I had a presentation in my class
I did a presentation about the new therapy for cancer
I am looking forward to the coming summer vacation soon..."

I want to learn English because i need it to for my future
I want to go to a the country where English is which its official language is English and I want to learn and improve my English."
Five \"senses\" are very important to me
I am always proud of this sense. (I noticed that my hand writing was uprising while I wrote this article on paper.) My recent writing is pretty good. I hope I can keep it up, and that flowing inspirations are always there when I am writing lyrics
Although I'd like to call myself an \"English lover\", I know my execution of English is hilarious, when it comes time to write
Dear Rachel, my friend from language exchange, what are you doing lately
You haven't sent me email for a while, I can't help but feel lonely
In the last six months, I have been fascinated by the world of rhythm
I joined a band as a Djembe and Cajon player last month
The band's name is kinda [sexually explicit\/lewd], so I don't think it would be appropriate to translate it into English here. (Actually, I have no idea how to translate it.) The band seems cynical [I was confused here, so I guessed that 'the band' seems cynical], but the members are very earnest (about what they do) and play very well
The thing worth mentioning is, last week, something inspired me when I was practicing the hand drums. I played a lot of new patterns and am good at flamenco all of a sudden
I wouldn't say I have a sense of rhythm, I still have a long long way to go, but my hands have started to feel something. It is delightful
To be continued …
I know this article is full of mistakes. Please feel free to tear it to shreds."

I really want to grow up! When I grow up I  can travel to any place that I like

In China,we learn English by reciting words and learning grammar
That isn't very fun

I know my shortcoming is my small and basic vocabulary
I will more coming.  Do you mean \"I will write more soon
I want to develop my English in order to be better than before
I Wish the best to you."
I got a three day weekend a week ago

To Learning a foreign language is too difficult, but I study hard

Hey guys
I've noticed that being polite in English-speaking cultures is extremely important, whereas it's not so important here in Argentina
For instance, I've been told that saying \"What?\" when you haven't understood what somebody has just said is not good manners. (This totally depends on the situation and what company you keep. If you are with friends and family it is totally acceptable to say ¨what?¨. However, there are much nicer ways to clarify what you have heard. You could say \"sorry?\", \"excuse me?\" or \"pardon?\". 
Instead, you should say: \"I'm sorry, could you repeat that?\", \"Sorry, didn't quite catch that\". The second example seems very British, but both are quite polite
My friends will come are coming to Singapore
My friends will come are coming to singapore next month
Where should I I bring them to
It's a very difficult problem
So I'm going around Singapore the next big long weekend
As a first step, I'm going to the Art Museum and as well as Geylang to eat some durian."
But they also make me a little melancholy. (Sounds more natural
Now, Japanese often go to drink and eat with their company at the beneath the cherry blossoms in full bloom to enjoy the short-lived blooming more
Sometimes we can enjoy cherry blossoms  even at night because they are lit up
So from ancient age to now, Japanese seems to become restless in this time."
Nice to meet you, everyone!!"
This is my first time
Today, I registered with LANG-8
I am working at an American hardware company as an engineer

When anything does not meet his expectation, he will throw lots of vulgar words at you with his temper tantrum just like one of those kids
Suck it up:  Whatever the client does to me and no matter how hard the job is, I have to suck it up for my career, but when the client runs off the edge in common sense or morality to hurt me, I will not just let him violate my dignity
Actually, it has happened a few times
On the other hand, the crystallized intelligence will fill my head to make the ability of learning new thing harder, and I guess that is why some people are getting stubborn as they get older
Some older people like to suggest things to you or tell you what to do and they believe that they are right because they have as similar experience as yours or have more life experience than you
When I was 10, there was no the internet, but nowadays, 10 years old children starts using PCs and using the internet, so if they have their own PCs, or parents allow them to use one, they can learn things from the internet without adults' help
