I would appreciate it if you could correct my sentences
It's been getting colder lately here in Japan. (\"These days\" is a phrase I often hear Japanese and Korean native speakers use in their English, although in native English speakers would probably say \"lately\" or \"recently\". It's sort of the equivalent of 最近
I find Japan's summer weather disagreeable because of its high humidity and temperature
So, as the winter is coming, I'm starting to feel better
It is a very exciting season
But, before enjoying those kind of happy times, I have to do a kind of boring, 
I have a fiancee and she is finding a job.(if she doesn't have a job yet use \"a\" job, butif she has a job then use \"her\" job
It doesn't seem easy for women to find jobs in Japan
The first, most women have babies and they have to take maternity leave
Employers don't like it even if maternity leave is the right of employees
The second,  women workers likely to quit their job because of child care or the transfer of ther husbands
If a woman worker quits her job, employers have to find a new employee
Though there are many women workers who have excellent potential, employers often hesitate to hire them
It is the first time
When I first arrived in Brisbane, it was always sunny
I am missing the warm weather
It's too hard for me
My goal is an overall 7.0, but it may need to more than 1 year
English is the harder , the more difficult language 
I really hope that I will be able to speak English like a native
I also have another problem
I always practice pronounciation, but it's getting more difficult
I dont know why I can't recognize \"ea\" \"i\" ,such as, \"cheap as chips
If I said that sentence, people will hear the same pronounciation
2 months later, I am going to back to Korea
I just learned the alphabet
It is said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japanese’s, so that the Korean who study Japanese take about 1 year to speak Japanese fluently, while the other foreigners have to take 3 or 4 years or more
I found that the Korean alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese’s
How about the way to spell
And after I entered the Japanese department, I even can’t recall any English grammar that I learned before
But it’s also said that it’s very difficult to learn both of them well
One time, I had a Japanese examination
The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before see a katakana word, we just try to think of an English word and then spell it
I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reason
Then I asked my brother for advice, he said that “I like Japanese
I was acquainted with him in a Chinese chat room when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago
He is a very special person, even though we’ve met in real life yet
He is 8 years older than me but he is just a friend
He is very humorous and handsome 
He can always make me smile even when I’m in a bad mood
But in my university, at the second year of regular training, we can choose a second qualification if we want and be able to study both well
My university has about 11 foreign language departments and some other department where they teach economics, travel business, computers, and so on… If we’re learning a foreign language, we’re advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness department so that when we graduate we will have the best job
So next year, I intend to choose the English department for the second qualification
When we’re at the third year, we have a compulsory subject
It’s different from the second qualification
Because the second qualification also has economics, travel business, computers… training and it isn’t compulsory
For example, I’m learning Japanese, I have to choose one of the 10 other foreign languages
So, if next year I choose the English department, the year after I may choose Korean for second foreign language
To learn almost fluent Japanese, we have 4 years
After that, I am not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently
It’s called “the love language”, isn’t it
Do you know our Uncle Ho was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages
I can’t do it like that but I wish I could learn at least 4: Japanese, English, Korean and French
Do I have the ability to do it
I’m very worried about it
This time  we still have to test 4 Japanese skills
I’m very nervous of speaking and listening skills
It was so bad, wasn’t it? The essay topic this time will be random
I’ll have to write anything in Japanese as the topic requests
Life is short
to try hard
We wore wedding dresses despite the absence of our bridegrooms
WishI send my best wishes for to her..  I know this might sound strainge, but this is a very common usage in English - to send someone good wishes on a birthday or other occasion
That is Those are my mother’s pictures, which were taken when she was younger.  Young is also correct, but the word younger is more polite, as it doesn't imply she is so old now
Isn't she beautiful
My computer’s CD ROM was broken so I can’t install Japanese font
I’ll try to continue this diary one near day next day
There is a big difference between the east and the west, when comes to education. I always admired how the westerners educate their posterity, their method is so gentle and kind, full of love and meaning, whereas the Asian method is rather more of violence more violent, for example the Chinese people believe that a child should be educated with rods
Countless beatings from their parent is believed to be capable of forging a successful child! That's how I was brought up at least. My parent always tell me how much they love me, although they served me with rod every time I committed a wrong doing. However, when comes to the western way of parenting, it sounds like a fairy tale to me. For example, the western parents always said this to their child if they happened to be repudiate, the parent will say this \"go to your room!\" This is something that will never happen in an Asian family
Maybe our parents would never realize the trauma they had inflicted on us!"
How successful was the League of Nations in establishing peace during the 1920s
The League of Nations was an organization formed to improve the lives and working conditions of the people around the world, to work for peace through disarmament and to uphold and enforce the Treaty of Versailles
The League was successful in establishing peace during the 1920s by discouraging aggression towards other countries through negotiation. The League also planned to provide collective security through a community of power, for example in the case of Silesia, where the League settled a dispute between Germany and Poland through a plebiscite. Another example is the Aaland Islands, where after an investigation the League managed to settle a dispute between Sweden and Finland. The League was also successful in improving living standards. For example they provided direct aid and welfare to the people in need around the world. One of their famous acts is the repatriation of 400,000 WWI prisoners, whom they employed them to kill mosquitos to prevent malaria and also to prevent leprosy. They also provided economic experts to help Austria and Hungary, as well as establishing the International Labour Organization
As Three of the most powerful nations in the world did not participate in the League of Nations: they are Germany
Russia and the United States. The two most powerful countries in the League, Britain and France, wanted to recover from their economic loss in WWI so they showed no enthusiasm to get involved. The League failed to establish disarmament, first in 1923 and then in 1931, both times because of Britain and Germany's unwillingness to cooperate. However they did arrange a conference in 1928 where the Kellog-Briand Pact, which was an act of the League's assembly outlawing war, was signed by 23 nations and supported by 65 countries and which outlawed war
However the League was unsuccessful because it largely failed to achieve most of their disarmament were not achieve
The greatest achievement of the League was its work on social issues. No organization had ever tackled these problems before; until now their campaign has been taken over by the U
N so it is a great success. However it failed to stop powerful countries starting a war, failed to establish disarmament and also failed to defend \/ uphold the Treaty of Versailles. These failures gave rise to aggression by the Axis powers."

China opposes Paris' award for Dalai Lama (中国反对巴黎为达赖喇嘛授奖
China On Tuesday, China condemned the honorary citizen award from Paris for the Dalai Lama, saying it posed \"a grave interference in Sino-French relations
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said China was indignant and resolutely opposed Paris's award for the Dalai Lama made despite China's opposition. (when a word ends in 's' you only have to put '    [For example James' bike is nice
Such a move stirs strong indignation among the Chinese people,\" Qin said, noting that inevitably, it would severely undermine the cooperation between Paris and Chinese cities, and gravely disturb China-France relations
He said, China held a clear, persistent and firm position over the Tibet issue, which was related to China's core interests and major political concern. he said
Qin urged Paris to stop interfering in China's internal affairs,and immediately correct its wrong-doing
Qin said that this move by the Paris government gravely damaged the city's image among the Chinese.Qin said
A poll on the website of the Global Times found more than 87 percent of voters firmly opposed the Paris' move
Paris should bear all the blame, Qin said, urging Paris to take the right attitude towards the Chinese people's voices, and stop its offence to the Chinese people, in a bid to create an essential condition for the cooperation with Chinese cities
The agenda for the dialogue will includes topics ranging from energy conservation and environmental protection, to finance and agriculture
Since it was first convened in 2007, the China-Japan high level economic dialogue has proven to be their most important mechanism for discussions on major economic concerns, and important regional and global economic issues
Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said, \"I think we two sides can make joint efforts in the following 5 aspects
Chen said, \"China's trade deficit to Japan was 34 and a half billion US dollars. (You could say 34.5 billion US dollars

So my friend and I went to see it

I could switch the car to another car
I thought I would need a navigation system on the car
Finally I could meet my friend 
at LA."

I began to learn English when I was about 16 years old
I have had English for about four years english now
For four weeks I was in the UK to learn English
I was in Cambridge and learned a lot
The school I was in was the studio school
Since last year, I have had a really bad English teacher
In my opinion, my English skills have decreased since I have had this teacher
So I began to learn Japanese by myself
I learned more Japanese then English last year
I don't have a Japanese teacher, but I think I learned more Japanese than English since I have had this English teacher
At the moment, I can write all the kana and about 200 kanji
But just the meanings and how to write them
I think it's easier to learn step by step
So I learn the vocabulary, grammar, and the meanings of the kanji
Also, I listen to JapanesePod101
It's very helpful because I don't have a Japanese teacher
The pronounciation is very difficult to learn without anyone who can speak japanese
While I am learning Japanese, I don't want to forget English, so I write here to improve english
My English teacher can't really help me
I am affraid that I am not good enough to write in Japanese
I just can only speak some short sentences like 'おげんきですか
You see, I write all in Kana because I didn't learned a lot of kanji
I hope I will learn a lot of Japanese

Japanese would say  \"今夜は月が綺麗ですね\"(which means \"The moon looks more beautiful tonight\") instead
I think what he meant was that \"love\" is the feeling that makes the moon looks brighter than the moon you (usually) see by yourself
Continuing from my previous journal entries
After the cake buffet, we saw off 名無しさん and  Porschla off at the bus station
Really? I didn't know! :D
So they must have had a great time there
They had a free day on Friday because their flight would depart on Saturday afternoon. (It was Saturday morning, actually
When they got down the buss, they looked really tired
I thought it was because of the long mountain route\/road
I had other choices in mind
But I decided to take\/bring them to Atsuta Shrine
So many people go there for a stroll
I turned on the TV immediately
My recent favorite soap opera starts at 13:30. (If you want to talk about a soap opera that is currently\/recently a favourite, then it's usually more natural to keep it in a separate sentence from a time reference. For example: Recently I have a new favorite soap opera. It starts at .... Or: My favourite soap opera at the moment is ..... It starts at ..... 
So I felt regret oversleeping. (Or simply: So I felt bad about oversleeping. Or: I wish I hadn't overslept
of the drama!! (You don't need to say this, since you've already explained it. 
There was a particularly memorable line. (To emphasize that it was really special
That was, \"Our happiness shouldn't be bought at the sacrifice of any of us.\" (I'm not sure what the translation is, but something that may sound more natural is: Our happiness shouldn't be attained at the cost\/sacrifice of others
What did you do with your mother
I went to the a revolving sushi bar named \"ざぶん\" with my family and mother's mom and father's mom
There were lots of \"moms
I had (so) many bottles of sake. (The 'so' is for emphasis ;p
Don't fall down! ;p
Maybe you guys don't have a culture to have a leisurely bath! (that's right... 
I need to go and buy it when I'm in Japan then! 
This sentence is grammatically correct, but a bit ambiguous as it can either mean 1) your friend is sick and hospitalized, or 2) your friend is working or for some reason, is in a hospital although s\/he is not sick
There is a park between the nearest train station and the hospital he is in
It was raining heavily, and I was listening to music on full volume
While I was walking through the park, somehow my wallet fell out of my pocket
When I realized, I broke out in a cold sweat
There were some cash cards, credit cards, my driver license, and other stuff in it
But my wallet was taken to the police station by a kind gentlemen
Somehow the police officer remembered it
I'm writing this journal entry using my iphone on the train
Today we are having a forum about the research that my lab conducting
This time it's a badminton tournament
All of the lab members including professors are gonna take part in the tournament
So this has a aspect which is entertainment for the professors!意訳ですが：So even the professors can enjoy themselves in such a sports event
I'm going to change\/transfer my train now
I will be back at Lang8 at tonight if I am not exhausted
it's not gone! I just corrected it 
Anyway, I got to keep my spirits up
What did you do for your mom
We just finished took the graduate school entrance test last week
After the test, we had an interview
During the interview, the interviewer told us if we did well or not at the test
So, what I have to do now is only doing research
By the way, I have a something to ask you
Do you believe that there is the a right thing in this world
Like the moon, things look different by from the different viewpoints you see from
We can't see the whole things at once
A Scientific speaking, we can only perceive by the reflection of lights
What I wanna say is, a right thing might be not be right thing for others
So, I bought a book called \"A Theory of Justice
I haven't read it more than 2 pages yet
I'm trying to finish this book within this month
I also started attending English conversation class
There are so many things to write about
One journal entry is not enough to finish up writing about my these days!"
名無しさん, her friends named Porschla, みよきちさん, atukiくん and his friend なつえ and me
The motivation for this trip was 名無しさん's journal entry
She wrote that she was planning to visit Takayama with her friend 
Takayama is in the northern part of Gifu prefecture and that is close to my hometown
Then me and other 2 of her Lang8 friends decided to serve as guides for them
The rendezvous was at the Golden Clock in Nagoya station at 10 a.m
This was absolutely our absolute first time to meet  each other. 
What do you mean by this
So I ordered a bowl of rice topped with fillet pork cutlet and 味噌 sauce
And it was excellent
That pork fillet was tender and went well with the sauce
And I love it! In almost all of the sentences that you wrote, you should replace \"that\" with \"it\". It's a little hard to explain why, though. In this sentence, \"And I love that\" really means \"And I love the fact that 味噌 is a special product of Aichi Prefecture.\" \"that\" really refers to an entire sentence, or an entire idea. On the other hand, \"And I love it!\" really means \"And I love 味噌\". In this case, \"it\" refers to the subject (person, place, thing) of the preceding sentence. So, if you write about the same subject in multiple sentences, you should use \"it\" instead
Tomorrow I will continue to write about this sightseeing trip
I am so glad that I could come back to here
I have been having some tough days. (More natural suggestion: I've been having a rough time lately. Or: I've had a rough few days
I couldn't stand without pain killers until a couple of days ago
I still have big holes in my mouth, but I can eat anything I want now
It's 2 a.m. here now
I went to the otolaryngology (no clue what this is but ok!) after school today
I had to wait there about 2 hours there
Then I went to the dispensary to get some medicines for on the prescription which the doctor wrote me. (I don't believe this sentence is ungrammatical but it is definitely odd sounding to me
Then I had a dinner at home and talked with my friend on the phone for an hour and half
Then, I chatted with Mimi for a hour. (or \"I then chatted
So I don't have much time to write this journal entry because I have to get ready to go school before I go to bed. (Again, not necessarily ungrammatical but this can also be read as you are planning to go to school tonight BEFORE you go to bed. Perhaps something like \"I have to get ready for school tomorrow and go to bed.\" That would clear all possible confusion
So this time, I will just introduce my favorite song
Actually, it was my first time to go around Tokyo since I was in the 3rd your year of junior high school
I stayed at my friend's house. He are will be going to university in Tokyo in 3 days' time, and we had drinks drank every night
I got home from Tokyo on Friday evening 
And I left my house and went to my other friend's house right away
Most of my old pals gathered in his house and we drank had drink all the night
I mean it\/ It's real
Actually, my friend did it. (Not me
I was just watching the whole thing while he was having a difficult time assembling it
I had pulled out my wisdom teeth yesterday!better:I had my wisdom tooth pulled out yesterday
It still hurts so bad badly
So the pain killer is necessary all day.so I need painkillers all day
I hope it will get recovered by this weekend at the latest
Right now, my face is puffed up like a balloon
I really wanna skip the classes on Monday
I still have  a slight headache and stuffy nose
And I feel dizzy (too). (it's better to add \"too\" at the end of this sentence to make it more natural, because you mentioned previously that you had a headache and a stuffy nose
I think the fever  has  already passed away
Anyway, I can't stay on the in bed anymore
I bought a couple of books about  the TOEFL
Have anyone taken  the TOEFL before
I'm thinking to of taking that test this summer
The TOEFL has a writing section
So I'm going to write journal entries along the policy that are in accordance with the requirements (?)  of  the TOEFL writing section
I have to finish some reports tonight
I couldn't bear it! 
Smoking is similar to summoning the Mephistopheles
It will give you a nominal relief
But you will have to repeat the spell every 4 hours
But I know
I live in 1000km away from the temblor's epicenter. 
Nonetheless I felt shakiness in my house. [We'd probably say it this way:] Nonetheless I felt my house shake. 
I pray for that damages won't extend any more."
I experienced so many things which were impossible in Japan
And now she is a freshman at Luther College
I hadn't ridden a bullet train in a while. (Use \"I had never\" when it was your first time ever
So I was worried that I might not see her...(I think it's more natural to use \"I was worried that ... [bad thing will happen]\". Or maybe \"I was worried about whether I could see her or not
Today was the first day of my lab's school year
This is the website of the lab. (This is the lab's website.\/Here's a link to the lab's website
The areas of research of this laboratory are Electric Power Equipment and High Electric Field phenomenon
I'm in my 4th year at Nagoya University now. (I'm a 4th year student at Nagoya University now.\/ I'm a NAgoya University senior now
I'm inexperienced and my research competence\/skill is not high enough
So I am going to knock myself out to learning as much as possible from great professors and seniors
My dream is to be a professor in the field of Electric Power Equipment and Asset management! (Both field or area are ok in this context, but region is probably best avoided
To realize my dream, I must do my best!!! (Also: I must do all that I can! I need to do my utmost!)"
I hope everyone had a great Christmas Day
The name of the band is \"celandaine
He is the lead vocalist of the band
And he also writes songs for the band
In a band competition which all teenage bands of Japan could enter, they were awarded first prize
So I am not sure if that name is proper English
Today I went to the YFU meeting for the long-term staying overseas students who are staying long-term here in Japan
They arrived here 2 months ago
And they are going back this winter
Wow... I can't. 
We talked about why they decided to come to Japan and what they liked of Japan
Most said that they really love the food of Japanese food
Fortunately, the exhibition of the Japanese art exhibition was held on the same floor of where we were having the meeting
And it was for free for all to admit. (Or, \"admittance fees were not required\"\/ \"It was free of charge
So I brought everyone into the exhibition
So if you blow at it, it will be destroyed
And he took the pictures of us for free (too
And then they treated us to matcha and cha-gashi by courtesy of them
It was a really good experience
And I really appreciate their many kindness to us!"
I get a cold
I get a cold. (are u still cold? get or it passed already --> got
So I take a day off to write a journal entry or So I'll take a day off to write a journal entry
Good night, everyone
I'm going to bed\/I'm going to sleep
I don't like  the rainy season
Many individuals believe that nuclear power plants are a considerable danger
The Chernobyl disaster left unforgettable damages due to the explosion of the plant and  the release of the radiation
Many countries, however, decided to reconsider of nuclear power plant development
So I wrote few lines along  related to the textbook
It was really hard to write an academic writing.  (It was really hard to write academically
But if I keep writing like this, I think I will get  a good score at on the TOEFL test
もちろんですよ！頑張ってください！＾＾
The weather forecast said the rain will go on for continue this week
I think it's a little bit early to set in for  the rainy season  to begin
I'm thinking of managing my daily schedules in English

What do you think
I bettered my own TOEIC score! (More natural may be: I beat my own TOEIC score record
The day before yesterday, the results of the 153th TOEIC test was announced on the internet
The score of the TOEIC will be converted into the score of the English section
And 905 points will be converted to 100 out of 100
What I meant is I am finally ready to concentrate upon the entrance examination for graduate school 
We held a 2 day orientation of the YFU exchange student program
I met some former friends from high school
We talked about our senses of value. (More natural: We talked about our values\/values in life
And we talked about our future careers
My grandpa finally passed away. (Even if it's expected it's probably better to avoid saying 'finally' because it gives the impression that not only were you waiting, but also hoping for it to happen. And that's not so nice. 
I am going to see the cherry blossoms with my lab members and professors!!!"
I was transferred to the 3rd year of Nagoya University from Toyota National College of Technology last year
So last year I experienced my first campus life
At the beginning of the school year, I had almost no friends at the university
But now I am aurrounded by many friends, seniors and juniors
I received so many greetings yesterday. (It's good to remember with 'i' and 'e' that: \"It's i before e, except after c.\" It's a rhyme we learned in school. 
From friends, family, friends in US, my host family and so on
Those made me realized I have been supported by so many people
And those gave me plenty of motivation! (It depends on if you're talking about the people or the congratulations you received. If people, then \"And those really gave me a push (when I needed it)!\" or if the congrats: \"And those really pepped me!\" for example
I am going to set about taking the math section of the entrance examination for graduate school tomorrow
It's been 2 months since my last journal entry
Time flies very\/really fast
I've been through so many \"exciting\" experiences these days. (\"stimulative\" is a little unnatural here
But this margin is too small to contain all my experiences
Fermat's theorem! 
I've been concentrating on my graduation research (recently), staying overnight in the lab twice a week. (adding \"recently\" makes the sentence smoother
And the pains! ;p
Going to an Amusement park with exchange students
I had to do so many tough stuffs like doing a presentation in front of all of the lab members and professors
But they never stay long enough in my brain
I feel contented myself by reading the English, but in actual fact, I learned nothing
I guess I need to put more focus on studying English
The highlight of the rides is the roller coaster called \"Steel Dragon
It was in the Guinness Book as the world's tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster
Some of the beams? were broken
I am not good at such rides machines
But one of them the exchange students who is from Michigan really likes those kind of things
So I was dragged along too
I chickened right in front of the platform once
I had been having a fear for a long time
It was way more fun funner than I thought
It's been a while since the last time I wrote in my journal
I'm sorry about I haven't been able to give you any help for a month
But I'm done with all of my exams
This means the beginning of 2 months of spring break
I'm trying to write a jounal at least once in aevery 3 days
And I'll try to give you what any help I can
By the way, I found some beautiful lines written by Miyazawa Kenji
But I don't know how to put it them into English
Flowers raining in the sky, we call them stars
Stars shining on the earth, we call them flowers
Something like this that
What the Japanese government said and what the foreign press said differed in many accounts
Maybe the Japanese government has been trying to control information to avoid a panic
but this backfired. and
many people are disoriented. or possibly \"disconcerted
The Tokyo Electric Power Company was one of the most secured reliable large companies
but that day, it fell off failed
Now, nothing is certain."
In addition to the my last journal entry, my birthday happens to coincide with the end of the cherry blossom season, so all the cherry trees are in full blossom
I went out to the park with my friends to enjoy a picnic under the cherry blossoms on my birthday
The park was congested  with many people. (It's okay to use 'congest', although I personally find it a little weird. Another word to use is \"crowded
So it was not as if I could enjoying the pretty gardens
But people were having fun with beer bottles in their hands and the foods of nearby stalls
As the time went by, people are spending lesser time to appreciate nature. 意訳ですが
But they still have hearts to love and enjoy having fun with friends! (I don't quite understand this sentence
this was not what I was going to write
So, see you then!"
【PR】My best friend's band is releasing their major debut album on 4\/21
He is one of my best friends
We went to the same school and had been in the same class for five years
I wrote a journal entry about him and his band a while ago
At that time, I asked you for some help for the name of the major debut album on his behalf
He hopes his songs will be the fire and warmth in your heart
Enjoying our lives is \"an\" important thing
But while we live in \"a\" each nations, there are responsibilities and obligations
I really \"have to\" reflect \"up\"on myself about this."
The subject was \"Is it possible that each of the people all over the world to use the same amount of energy that a Japanese uses now
At no distant future a time may come when people will use up all the oil
But if the blade is damaged by lightning and needs replacement, the wind must be slight enough to undertake the repair work safely
This means that operating a wind power generator requires constant and powerful wind but it must be stopped periodically
So I think I should go to bed a bit than earlier tonight
I will write more about the energy problem sometime soon
I have appointment with doctor tomorrow morning
So I have to finish it tonight and leave him to turn it tomorrow morning
I haven't dinner yet
Sorry that I've been unable to correct your journals these days.(´；ω；｀
So correcting your journal entries from that computer is really hard to do.(´・ω・
So I'm thinking I will bring the laptop computer which I usually use at home to the lab, and leave it there for some time
Furthermore, my graduation research could be a kind of simulation stuff,I think. (Sorry, don't know what you are trying to say
YES
But I decided to do it to save my money
But it's gonna be much more powerful than the ones made by manufacturers
I'm thinking of using some wire shelves which I've kept outside
They are covered badly with rust so bad
I have a BBQ and hiking (to do) this weekend
I guess this is gonna take a while."
I didn't have a refrigerator
and so, I used to take my meals at the school cafeteria, or just buy some convenience food
And by gigantic city, I mean (it's) Tokyo
Feng-Sui derives from China, long time ago
But has been used in Japan since medieval times for a long time
Where the queer monk, 天海, rearranged the whole city of Edo under the Feng-Shui's doctrine
To make the long story short, he changed the names of places around the castle
He also placed many temples and Japanese style gardens under the Feng-Sui style
Though many of Japanese are not aware of it
I was at the \"Tacos Party\" last night
All the participants works for YFU as a volunteers
The second picture is of the handmade tiramisu
One of them had the birthday recently had his\/her birthday
It was not only tacos party, but also her birthday party
It's been a week since the last time I wrote a jounal
Last Thursday, I was present at the party.Last Thursday, I went to a party
That party was aimed for learnig English conversation!The party was to help us practice English conversation
ThisThese kind of parties are held periodically
But this was my first time to take part in one
And I waited for them about 30 minutes underin the cold wether
We could drink as much many drinks as we wanted
I drunk littersdrank litres of Gin and Tonic
We onlyjust had English conversations
But also it was fun to talk with Japanese people who are interested in English
I forgot about that this was my firtst time and enjoyed speaking English
Those pictures were taken at there
I am the guy who is accidentally kissing with the 42 year old guy in the second picture.) 
Around 22:30, people started leaving. if not they were missing the last trains.If they didn't, they would miss the last trains
Then wemoved to the next place
We walked about 10 or 20 minutes with a straggeringly!Lol - i don't know what you're saying here! 
We talked about many funny things (mostly indecent things) at there
We stayed at there until morning
I have TOEIC test in a months
I didn't  write a journal entry last night.ｐ(≧ヘ≦。)ｑ
But the computer which was provided for me by the lab was really slow
I tried to uninstall some applications and did a virus check (too). (It will sound more natural if you add \"too\" at the back of your sentence
It took a couple of hours. (This is a set phrase, \"a couple of ...\", \"a set of...\", \"a dozen of...\" etc etc
Then the workshop started
When I got to home, it was (already) past 10 p.m. (＞、＜
I still could write a journal entry but I was too exhausted
I need to be more steady
And sleeps for only an hour
He says his bed is too comfortable so
He might sleep for more than an hour if he sleeps in the bed
I don't know if an hour is enough for me
I feel proud of Japan's culture
I also feel sad for the losses of that culture
The Golden Week starts tomorrow
There are many different theories regarding what motiveates human beings to act in the ways in the what they do
I agree with the latter position because all human societal activities are directly or indirectly involved with other people around us. これの方がいいと思うけど。
Ultimately any kind of human actions are is molded by affection to from others
And I'm in the middle of the section about \"Introduction.\" hehe!　（省略しても大丈夫だと思うよ）
Now I'm writing a paper about the currents state and futeure prospects of the energy supprly in Japan
格好いいな！＾＾難しいトピックじゃない？
The more I learn, the more obvious it is that the development of the nuclear power plant is reasonable

Most of people say Eminem is one of the coarsest rappers in the history of music because of his behavior, words and his songs which are studded with insults
He has put affronts upon affronted\/insulted many celebrities in his songs such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and even his ex-wife. \"Put affronts upon\" might not be incorrect (I didn't check) but it sounds awkward
A song which is in on his 3rd album, however, shows those of his insults might be not his real intention. I think people usually say that a song is on an album, not in it
This song which you might have not heard of is named \"Hailey's Song
Hailey\" is his daughter's name
Please turn off or put your cellphone into silent mode while watching the show music video. (I think \"show\" is for something longer --like a TV program
the \"Hailey's Song
There is a huge forest where no one can trespass on its holy ground in the middle of a capital city which is well-known worldwide
The priest is a direct descendant of the the world's oldest dynasty, and he is also the only emperor who exists in the whole world now
There are three holy durables called \"The Three Sacred Treasures
Those are owned by the emperor and have been passed from generation to generation
Each of them is being guarded closely at the ancient sanctuaries and they are regarded untouchable
The gigantic city itself has also been closely protected by layered magics by a  sublime wizard since it was established
So it is an artificial city defended by magic
It is of unprecedented scale and no other such city is longer in existence, evenin the cradle of the magic."

I feel like they are doing such things just for fun (only
The First thing that I want to emphasize is there is no difference between a whale and a cow
Biologically they are both classified as mammals
Do you think it can be used as a reason to not kill it\/them
We have the culture to appreciate (?) all lives equally
April 1st is the day which called known as April Fools' Day
But I am not going to be a fool in this journal
April is the beginning of school season
I graduated from Nagoya University and got the degree of Bachelor of Engineering last month
Now I'm going to graduate school at Nagoya University
I learned many things during last year
They were not only special knowledges.I also learned more than just academics
My aim of for this year is \"learn a lot, and play a lot\" by using efficient time management!"
Midterms are finally over with! (When you say \"I am over with midterms\", this actually means \"I am fed up with midterms!\" and \"I will never study for\/write a midterm ever again!\" What I wrote is closer to what you meant, I think
Finally, the mid-terms are done over now
But not for this year
This year, it means, finally I can finally focus on my research
How about, \"Optimization of strategic maintenance of electrical equipments\"? 
I have no idea how to solve\/go about doing this yet
I have only 5 months to finish this
So I have no time to repose! [Although, \"repose\" work--it sounds odd in everyday language. I think a better word to use would be \"rest
I haven't touched my electricalelectronic dictionary these days
This means I haven't used English these days for some time. 
Learning English is unavoidable for my future. (It's a bit awkward to use \"not avoidable\" where you can use \"unavoidable\" IMHO
I have to spend more time on learning\/my English! (This sounds more natural to me)"
It has been really cold until last week
In the middle of April, It's usually warm enough to go out with wearing only a long-sleeved shirt or sometimes a casual jacket over here
But on the day of last week, it was so cold that I needed to wear a down jacket even though it's already spring! (I think an exclamation mark is more suitable here ;p
Today, the professor of the energy transforming engineering class told us some of his doubts on global warming
He described it from the viewpoints of the number of the sunspots, the axis of the earth and the earth's yearly spins 
He said that the earth is facing a global cooling now (instead of global warming). (It will make your sentence more complete if you add the blue words behind
He said it will induce a rather cool summer all over the world
The weather forecast said tomorrow is gonna be cold
I just can't wait for the nice warm spring!"
We took part in it under the YFU, (the comma here makes the sentence easier to understand) which was the exchange organization that took care of me while I was staying in America
I have been told that we were supposed to explain the activities of the YFU to students  who were interested in studying abroad
We have held such a meeting last month
So we thought that this would proceed as easily as last month's meeting
But it wasn't\/didn't
Actually this event was like a kind of extracurricular activities to the highschool girls
There were a lot of other organizations such as the group of Japanese drum players, the welfare workers and a rival organization that is called AFS
But all of them were mostly for people who wanted to study abroad
So the contents of slide show\/presentation which we prepared were mostly about how to apply for the YFU exchange program, the history of the YFU and the structure of the organization
So it was a serious type of thing and wasn't a fun thing at all
The rival organization, AFS, on the other hand, was doing really fun stuff
We totally misunderstood the purpose of the event
We felt as if we were lying on a bed of thorns."
Last Saturday, we held a Christmas Party for the exchange students
There were nine exchage students staying in the Tokai area through YFU
YFU is the one of the world's largest exchange organizations
Three years ago, I went to America for a year as an exchange student through YFU
I really appreciate to them
So, to replay and express my feeling of gratitude, I'm working for YFU as a volunteer now
These exchange students are returning to their homelandhomeat the beginning of next month
So we wanted them to have one more another precious memory of Japan <to take home with them
That was why we held the christmas party
A previous YFU exchange student now runs a cafe in Nagoya, he let us use his hall for the party
It was a really nice place
It had a nice interior with cool drawings painted all over the walls
Maybe these are drawn by themselvesthey were originals
Over 30 people came to the Christmas party, it was lovely
The foreign exchange students brang their friends - their age ranged from my age to over 50
We provided them with many snacks ,juices and Japanese traditional food like Temaki-Sushi
We had a game called \" Russian roulette wasabi cream puff
Wasabi is Japanese horseradish
It is really pungent spicy
After game,we enjoyed chatting with each other and the hall rung with the sound of laughter
One of the exchange students had a birthday on that day
So we celebrated her 17th birthday with a very cute birthday cake
I hope we made an unforgettable memory for them
I want to thank everyone who helped make this such successful party. 
I parked on the street (around\/near from) the university
And (place) where I parked was only 2 meters away from the crossroad
I (had) to pay the penalty of it (for this)｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡
The fine of (illegal) parking (is\/was) ￥18000
That was) so expensive
But I (had) to accept (that\/it), otherwise I (would got) arrested
Oh man, If I didn't commit (it), I could buy another monitor (and\/or) a graphic board!!! ---> are u for real?! 
Oh, just in case, I will upload the picture of the area that you are not allowed to park
Be careful when you park your car on (the\/that) road!"
Last week we recieved a his health screening report, and it showed some unusual numerical values.*Note: Your sentences were fine, but I might write the two sentences this way
It showed some unusual numerical values
The doctor said he has the metastasis spread of cancer of all around his body
The doctor also said his days are numbered, 3 months at the most
I'm really proud of him. my grandpa
He has given me a lot of help in life
When I hoped to study abroad in America, he was the one who approved and paid all of the expenses
He also paid my tuition fees, and what's more he is saving to prepare for my graduation school fees
When I got back from one year of studying abroad, I visited my grandparents first
He took one look at me, and suddenly he stormed about my hair color
Can you yell at the grandson you haven't seen for a whole year
He couldn't overlook that I seemed to have changed my identity and lost my pride in being Japanese
So next day, I had my hair cut really short, and dyed it black
Then I visited them again and apologized
Because I think it is part of the Japanese identity
He brought me up
I have never faced such a situation before, that someone who is really close to me is dying
At first, I kind of lost my grasp of what I was facing
I couldn't think of what I should tell him
Strangely enough I haven't been terribly grieved this week
Because I was too busy with my university stuff and other work I'm responsible for
I really appriciate what he has given me
And his innermost thoughts are living in me
Of course I wasn't going to cry
I was going there relieve him
When I saw him and his gaunt face, I couldn't check the flow of tears
I've realized what I am facing, he is passing away
I couldn't tell him what I was going to say well because the tears kept interefering
And also I realized I can not possibly put my gratitude into words
I vowed to work as much as I could and contribute to the world to his face
Beyond that, I could only tell him \" Thank you for everything, everything you have given me.\" And I left his house with saying \" See you later
If I were to die tomorrow, I would feel that I haven't yet shared enough of what my grandpa has given to me. couldn't put what he had gave to me to account enough
So I decided to try to take more oppotunities to tell my friends, my juniors and you who is reading my diary, what I learned until now
And I'll try harder to leave more things in this world
I represent my honorable grandpa
I should never disgrace his honour
Today I had my third time of the English conversation class
日に一画足して9個漢字を作るという問題がとけません。
First we were given a piece of paper which is written the article (where an article was printed) but some sentences are blanked (were left blank
Then the teacher read the article to us, and we filled in the blanks. [ I had never thought about \"filled in\" and \"filled out\" before. That's the beauty (one of the beauties) of Lang-8. You see your native language in a new light! The two phrases are almost alike. I would use \"fill in\" when completing a puzzle, and \"fill out\" for a job application or for a new doctor's file, information about yourself. ] 
And we filled out (in) the blanks
雨の日も、風の日も、靴の紐。[Japanese-style pun]. I think it is punny
Oh, there is a home work (homework) due next week
Then it hit me.\" [ \"Then it hit me\" is an expression that means \"I quickly realized.\" The pun here is that both the ball and the realization that the ball looked bigger because it was coming at you so fast (the nearer the ball comes, the closer you are to getting hit with it) both \"hit you\" at once -- the ball physically hit you and the realization mentally hit you. Here's another example: \"I wondered where I had left my umbrella. I searched the house. No luck. Then \"it hit me\" (I quickly, suddenly realized) I'd left it under my car seat.\" OR, \"I was daydreaming yesterday when suddenly a great idea hit me.\" (It came to me as fast as lightning.) 
直訳：「球が近づいていたら、頭が打かられた。」\"hit me\"は「気が付く」も「ぶつかれた」もと言う意味です。
My favorite one is, \"There was a sign on the lawn at a (the) drug re-hab center that said 'Keep off the Grass
Today I went to the Atsuta shrine and the Shiratori Japanese-style garden
A Shinto shrine is a structure which is made built as the house of kami-sama
It's placed in a It's only an hour from my house but I had never been there before
I love your photos!!! 
t I felt like \"the true colors of Japan\" was were there
Can I walk on this bridge
There Here are some rules about paying homage at a shrine
2 You have to must walk on the left side of the road because its center is for only the kami-sama to walk. may walk in the center
Then tap your hands twice , bow and make a wish with your desire in your heart
At this point, After you make your wish, you shouldn't speak your wish in voice. say it outloud
These are some of the conventions of Shinto
But I saw many people who didn't follow them
Japanese-style gardens are often made in imitation of the real scenery
And this is the biggest Japanese-style garden in Nagoya which that imitated the scenery of this area
It has a quaint atmosphere
I think leaves of the trees will be really beautiful when they will turn in autumn and it must be really beautiful
It's been 2 days since I met you, my brain is full of you
Because if I touch you I think everything I've established is gonna collapse
That fear could alienate you
If I had got on you in my birthday suit, 
being held by you until the moon set over the sea, and shared the panorama of the color of the sky
I would've not be feeling this gloom
Oh) How many times will I have more sleepless nights will I have
I cannot concentrate on anything else; but I'm just so in love with you
my dear new bed."
I'm not in a good shape
This morning I woke up with a horrible stomachache
So I ran into the bathroom as soon as I left the bed. 他の言い方： So I rushed into the bathroom the moment I left my bed\/woke up. (This is slightly more natural but your sentence is okay too
I didn't feel good since last Saturday
This happens periodically\/occasionally
It's like, only the air is being thin only around me becomes very thin
I can't center my focus\/concentrate on my studying\/revision
I made a promise to myself! 
On the day of my birthday, I decided to never fail to write a journal entry everyday
This was way I was in a hurry last night
It is the biggest priority for me to keep my promises
But I will keep it up
I will try to persevere through!!! (Using \"undaunted\" is a little weird here
Now it's 12:30 in Japan now
Or, \"I don't know what else I can say
It might be the best movie I've ever watched. [or \"ever seen
I have watched many movies. [or \"have seen
But I had never watched such a movie before. [seen
So I don't know how to comment on it
Actually, Radiohead’s Last Flowers is used as an ending song for the film
I've heard the news that Hollywood is remaking it with Daniel Radcliffe and Nicole Kidman
I'm sure it will fail
Because I'm sure that it is impossible to make this movie except in Japanese\/in Japan\/for a Japanese audience
What I'm trying to say is, even if you are a great chef, you can't make a Japanese dish with American seasoning
Ah, I can't quite express my feelings
There is only one thing that I am sure of
It is that I am glad that I could watch this movie
After we had lunch at 矢場とん, we went to the Nagoya Castle!　(You don't need 'the' since Nagoya is considered the name of the castle.) 
Perhaps I had been there before, but I didn't remember anything of it
They looked realistic. (They looked like the real thing
Then we moved to 栄 and went to the restaurant which serves a cake buffet
They served more than 15 kinds of cakes and we could eat as many as we wanted! (I think in all cases, instead of 'serve\/served', I would use 'have\/had' instead. Serving implies that it is handed over to you in person. And usually that's not the case with a buffet. 
They served cream puffs, custard puddings, short cakes, and many other cakes which I had never seen before
The clerks ,customers and everyone in the house sang birthday song toghether
We had plenty of cakes and a great time
Then we took 名無しさん and Porschla to the bus station and they departed for Takayama
They had a free day in Nagoya because the flight reserved would departure this afternoon

How to Make Friends Titles are capitalized. 
When I was young, I found it very easy to make a new friend
However, it's more and more hard now
Why?, I think it is because of the lack of trust
When we are little, we even don't know what is right and what is wrong
