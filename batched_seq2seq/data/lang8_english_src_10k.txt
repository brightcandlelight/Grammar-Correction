I will appreciate it if you correct my sentences
It's been getting colder these days here in Japan
The summer weather in Japan is not agreeable to me with its high humidity and temperature
So, as the winter is coming, I'm getting to feel better
It is the very exciting season
But, before enjoying those kind of happy time, I have to do a kind of boring, 
I have a fiancee and she is finding her job
It seems not easy to find a job for women in Japan
The first, most women have baby and they have to take maternity leave
Employers don't like it even if maternity leave is the right for employees
The second,  women workers likely to quit their job because of child care or the transfar of ther husbands
If a woman worker quit her job, employers have to find a new employee
Though there are many women workers who have excellent potentil, employers often hesitate to hire them
It was first time
When I was arrived in Brisbane, it was always sunny
I am missing warm weather
Its too hard for me
My goal is an overall 7.0, but it may need to more than 1 year
English is the harder , the more difficult
I really hope that I speak English seems to native
Also, I have another problem
I always practice pronounce, but getting more difficult
I dont know why I cant recognize \"ea\" \"i\" ,such as, \"cheap as chips
If I said that sentence, people will be heard same pronounciation
2 months later, I am going to back to Korea
I just learnt alphabet
It’s said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japanese’s, so that the Korean who study Japanese just have to take about 1year to speak Japanese fluently, while the other foreigners have to take 3,4 years or more than so 
I found that the Korean’s alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese’s
How about the way of spell
And after I entered the Japanese department, I even can’t recall any English’s grammars that I’d learnt before
But it’s also said that it’s very difficult to learn well both of them
One time, I had an Japanese examination
The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before when see a katakana word, we just try to think of an English word and then spell it
I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reasons
Then I asked my brother for an advice, he said that “I like Japanese
I was acquainted with him in a Chinese’s room chat when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago
He is very special person, even though we’ve met in real life yet
He is 8 years older than me but he just likes a friend
He is very humorious and handsome 
He can always make me smile even when I’m in bad mood
But in my university, at the second year of regular training, we can choose a second qualifications if we want and sure that we’ll be able to study well both
My university has about 11 foreign language’s departments and some other department where teach economics, travel bussiness, computer and so on… If we’re learning a foreign language, we’re advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness’s department so that when we graduate we will have a best job
So next year, I intend to choose English department for the second qualifications
And when we’re at the third year, we have a compulsory subject
It’s differ from the second qualifications
Because the second qualifications  also has economics, travel bussiness, computer… training and it isn’t compulsory
For example, I’m learning Japanese, I have to choose one in 10 other foreign languages remained
So, if next year I choose the English department, the year after I maybe choose Korean for second foreign language
To learn almost Japanese, we have 4 years
After that, it’s not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently
It’s called “love’s language”, isn’t it
Do you know our Uncle Ho who was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages
I can’t do like that but I wish I could learn at least 4: Japanese, English, Korean and French
Do I have the ability to do
I’m very worry about it
This time  we still have to test 4 Japanese’s skill
I’m very nervous of speaking and listening skill
It was so bad, wasn’t it?And the essay’s topic this time will be random
I’ll have to write anything in Japanese as topic’s request
And life is short
This is try hard
We wore wedding dress despite the absence of our bridegrooms
Wish best wishes for her
That is my mother’s pictures which were taken when she was young

There is a big difference between the east and the west, when comes to education,i always admired how the westerner educate their posterity,their method is so gentle and kind,full of love and meaning,whereas the asian method is rather more of violence,for example the chinese people believe that a child should be educated with rods
countless beating from their parent is believe to be capable of forging a successful child!thats how i was brought up at least, my parent always tell me how much they love me although they served me with rod every time i commit a wrongdoing,however when comes to the western way of parenting,it sounds like a fairy tale to me,for example the western parent always said this to their child if they happened to be repudiate, the parent will say this\" go to your room!\" this is something that will never happen in an asian family
May be our parent would never realize the trauma they had inflicted on us
how successful was the league of nations in establishing peace during the 1920s
The league of nations is an organization form to improve lives and jobs of the people around the world,settle peace by disarmament ,and to uphold and enforce the treaty of Versailles
The league was successful in establishing peace during 1920s through discouraging aggression to other countries by negotiation ,the Lon also plan to provide collective security by a community of power,example silesia,where the league settle a dispute between germany and poland through plebiscite,another example is the aaland where under lon's investigation settle a dispute between sweden and finland,the league is also successful in improving the life of people,for example they provide direct aid and welfare to the people in need around the world,one of the famous act is the repatriation of 400000 ww1 prisoners and employ them to kill mosquitos to prevent malaria and also prevent leprosy,they also provide economic experts to help Austria and Hungary as well as establishing the international labour organization
As three of the most powerful nations in the world do not participate in the lon they are germany
russia and united state,the two most powerful countries in lon britain and france wanted to recover their economic loss in ww1 so they show no enthusiastic to get involve,the league fail to establish disarmament,first in 1923 and second in 1931 both fail because britain and germany,however they did arrange a conference in 1928 the kellog-briand pact which was an act of league assembly sign by 23 nations and supported by 65 countries and which outlawed war
however they are unsuccessful because most of their disarmament  were not achieve
the greatest achievement of the league is the social issue no organization had ever do it before ,until now their war has been taken over by the U
N so it is a great success,however it fail to stop powerful countries starting a war,fail to establish disarmament,also fail to defend the treaty of Versailles ,these give rise to aggression by axis power
Now It's snowing in Tokyo 
When I was a child, I liked snowing

Qin urged Paris to stop interfering in China's internal affairs,and immediately correct its wrongdoing
This move by the Paris government gravely damaged the city's image among the Chinese, Qin said
A poll on the website of the Global Times found more than 87 percent of voters firmly opposed the Paris move
Paris should bear all the blame, Qin said, urging Paris to takethe right attitude towards the Chinese people's voice, and stop its offence to the Chinese people, in a bid to create an essentialcondition for the cooperation with Chinese cities

I rode from the bike shop to home on it right after I purchased
It was 30 minutes ride
It was great to ride roadway
There weren't any bumpy things, so I could go really fast
But I often had to stop and turn my face back because there were so many taxis cars parking on the streets
My bike doesn't have a stand, so I lifted it up and brought it in front of my apartment which is on the 3rd floor
The frame is aluminum made, so it is light as a feather

I bought a sleeping bag
From now on, I can stay up all night in the lab comfortably
No more arranged chairs
The love and the Japanese language
Japanese, however, hadn't have the proper word which signifies \"love\" because of the sensibilities and lyricism
When one of his students put \"I love you\" into Japanese as ”私はあなたを愛しています\", he warned him against that translation
Japanese should put it into like  \"今夜は月が綺麗ですね\"(which means \"The moon looks more beautiful tonight\") instead
I think what he meant was that \"love\" is the feeling that makes the moon looks brighter than the moon you see by yourself
Previously of my last journal entries

Nonetheless I felt shakiness in my house
I pray for that damages won't extend any more
I experienced so many things which were beyond possibility in Japan
And now she is a freshmen of Luther College
I had never ridden a bullet train for a while
So I was worried about if I could see her
Today was the first day of this school year of the lab I belong
This is the Website of the lab
The regions of research of this laboratory are Electric Power Equipment and High Electric Field phnemenon
I'm in my 4th year of Nagoya University now
I'm inexperienced and my competence for reseaching is not enough
So I am going to knock myself out to learn as many as possible from great professors and seniors
My dream is to be a professor of the reagion of Electric Power Equipment and Asset management
To realize my dream, I must do my possible
I hope everyone had a great day of Christmas
The name of band is \"celandaine
He is a lead vocalist of the band
And he also write songs for the band
They have been awarded the first prize of a band competition which was all teenage bands in Japan could enter
So I am not sure if that name means properly
Today I went to the YFU meeting for the long-term staying overseas students
They arrived here 2 month ago
And they are leaving this winter
He could write the kanji of \"鬱
We talked about why they decided to come to Japan and what they like of Japan
Most said that they really love the food of Japan
Fortunately, the exhibition of the Japanese art was held on the same floor of where we were having the meeting
And it was for free to admit
So I took everyone into the exhibition
So if you blow it, it will be destroyed
And he took the pictures of us for free
And then they treated us to matcha and cha-gashi by courtesy of them
It was the really good experience
And I really appreciate their many kindness to us
I cought a cold
I got a cold
So I take a day off to write a journal entry
Good night everyone
I'm going to bed
I don't like rainy season
Many individuals believe that nuclear power plants are considerable danger
The Chernobyl disaster left unforgettable damages due to the explosion of the plant and release of the radiation
Many countries, however, decided to reconsider of nuclear power plant development
So I wrote few lines along the textbook
It was really hard to write as Academic writing
But if I keep writing like this, I think I will get good score at the TOEFL test
Don't you think so
The weather forecast said the rain will go on for this week
I think it's a little bit early to set in the rainy season
I'm thinking to mange my daily schedules in English
I'm thinking to manage my daily schedules in English
So would you tell me how people usually write them on their notebooks
9:00～12:00 Group Discussiong of Hanai group at IB Room 101

How' do you think
I bettered my own record of  TOEIC
The day before yesterday, the result of the 153th TOEIC test was announced on the internet
The score of the TOEIC will be converted into the score of the English
And 905 points will be converted to 100 out of 100
What I meant is I am finally ready to concentrate upon the entrance examination of the graduate school 
We hold a 2 day orientation oft YFU exchange student program
I met some former friends at high school
We talked about our senses of value
And we talked about our future career
My grandpa finally passed away
I am going to see the cherry blossams with my lab members and professors
I was transfered to the 3rd grade of Nagoya University from Toyota National College of Technology last year
So last year I experienced my first campas life
At the bigginning of the school year, I had almost no friend in the university
But now I am aurrounded by many friends, senors and juniors
I recieved so many greetings yesterday
From friends, familiy, friends in US, host family and so on
Those mede me realized I had been supported by so many people
And those gave me plenty of push
I am going to set about the math section of the entrance examination for graduate school tomorrow
It's been 2 month since my last journal
Time flies very fast
I've been through so many stimulative experiences these days
But this margin is too small to contain
Fermat's phrase
I've been sticking on my graduation research, staying overnight in the lab twice a week
But finally I'm realizing the fun of research
Going to a Amusement park with exchange students
I had to do so many tough stuffs like having a presentation in front of all of the lab members and professors
But they never remain in my brain
I feel like I just content myself with reading English, but I learned nothing
I guess I need to put more stress on English
The centerpiece of the rides is the roller coaster called \"Steel Dragon
It was on the Guinness Book as the world's tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster
Some of them were broken
I am not good at  scream machines
But one of them who is from Michigan really likes those kind of things
So I was dragged to them
I chickened right in front of its platform once
I had been having a prejudice for a long time
It was way much funner than I thought
It's been a while since last time I wrote my journal
Sorry about I haven't been able to give you any help for a month
But I'm done with all exams
This means beginning of 2 months of spring break
I'm trying to write a jounal at least once in a 3 days
And I'll try to give you what help I can
By the way, I found beautiful lines written by Miyazawa Kenji
But I don't know how to put it into English
Flowers raining in the sky, we call them star
Stars shines on the earth, we call them flower
Something like this
What Japanese government said and what foreign press said differed in many accounts
Maybe Japanese government has been trying to control information to avoid panic
But this backfired
Many people are disarrayed
Tokyo Electric Power Company was one of the most secured large companies
But that day, it fell off
Nothing is certain
In addition to the my last journal, my birthday is placed at the end the season of that cherry trees are in full blossom
I went out to the park with my friends to enjoy a picnic under the cherry blossoms on my birthday
The park was congested  with many people
So it was not like enjoying the tasteful gardens
But people were having fun with beer bottles in their hands and the foods of stalls
As the time rolls on, people are losing their hearts to love the nature
But they still have hearts to love and enjoy having fun with friends
this is not what I was going to write
So see you then
【PR】My best friend's band is releasing the major debut album on 4\/21
He is a one of my best friends
We went to the same school and had been in a same class for five years
I've written a journal about him and his band a while ago
At that time, I asked you for some help for the name of the major debut album in behalf of him
He hopse his songs will be your fire and warm your heart
Enjoying our lives is important thing
But while we live in each nations, there are responsibilities and obligations
I really reflect on myself about this
The subject was \"Is it possible that each of the people all over the world uses the same amount of energy that a Japanese uses now
At no distant date, the time may come when people will have used up all the oil
But if the blade is damaged by lightning and need replacement, the wind must be slight enough to undertake the construction work safely
This means that operating a wind power generator requires constant and powerful wind but it must stop periodically
So I think I should go to bed a bit than earlier tonight
I will write more about the energy problem sometime not distant date
I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning
So I had to finish it tonight and leave him to turn it tomorrow morning
I haven't had dinner yet
Sorry about I've been unable to correct your journals these days.(´；ω；｀
So correcting your journal entries from that computer is really hard to do.(´・ω・
So I'm thinking to bring the laptop computer which I usually use at home to the lab, and leave it for some time
Furthermore, my graduation research could be a kind of simulation stuff, I think
Don't you think so
But I decided to do it to save my money
But it's gonna be much more powerful than ones made by manufacturers
I'm thinking to use some wire shelfs which I've kept outside
They are covered with rust so bad
I have the BBQ and hiking this weekend
I guess this gonna take a while
I didn't have a refrigerator
So I used to take meals at school cafeteria or just buy some convenience food
And by gigantic city, I mean it's Tokyo
Feng-Sui derives from Chinese long time ago
But It had been used  in Japan since medieval times for a long time
And the queer monk, 天海, rearranged whole city of Edo under the Feng-Shui's doctrine
To make a long story short, he changed the names of places around the castle
He also placed many temples and Japanese style garden under the Feng-Sui
Many of Japanese are not aware of it
I was at the \"Tacos Paty\" last night
All participants works for YFU as a volunteer
The second picture is of the hadmade tiramisu
One of them had the birthday recently
It was tacos party but also her birthday party
It's been a week since last time I wrote a jounal
Last Thursday, I was present at the party
That party was aimed for learnig English conversation
This kind of parties are held periodically
But this was my first time to take part in
And I waited them about 30 minutes under the cold wether
We could drink as much drinks as we want
I drunk litters of Gin Tonic
We only had English conversations
But also it was fun to talk with Japanese who are interested in English
I forgot about that this was my firtst time and enjoyed speaking English
Those pictures were taken at there
I am the guy who is accidentally kissing with 42 old guy in the second picture.) 
Around 22:30, people started leaving if not they were missing the last trains
Then wemoved to next place
We walked about 10 or 20 minutes with a straggeringly
We talked about many funny things (mostly indecent things) at there
We stayed at there until morning
I have TOEIC test in a months
I didn't  write a jounal enry last night.ｐ(≧ヘ≦。)ｑ
But the computer which is provided for me by the lab was really slow
I tried to uninstall some applications and did a virus check
It took couple hours
Then workshop started
When I got to home, it was past 10 p.m. (＞、＜
I still could wirte a jounal but I was too exhasted
I need to be more steadily
And sleeps only a hour
He says his bed is too comfortable
He might sleep more than a hour if he sleeps in the bed
I don't know if a hour is enough for me
I feel proud of Japan
I also feel sad for the losses of those culture
The Golden Week starts tomorrow
There are many different theories regarding what motivetes human being to act in the ways in the what they do
I agree with the latter position because all human activities have something to do with society which embrace the other people
Ultimately any kind of human actions are mold by affection to others
And I'm in the middle of the section about \"Introduction.\" hehe
Now I'm wring a paper about the currents state and futere prospects of the energy suppry in Japan
I'm examining the renewable energy and the nuclear power
The more I learn, the more obvious that the development of the nuclear power plant is reasonable
I don't think I could write what I intended properly
But, \"Haste makes wastes!\",\"Stay calm!\" and \"Be cool
Most of people say Eminem is one of the coarsest rappers in history of music because of his behavior, words and his songs which are studded with insults
He has put affronts upon many celebrities in his songs such as Michel Jacson, Elvis Presley and even his ex-wife
A song which is in his 3rd album, however, shows those of his insults might be not his real intention
This song which you might heve not heard of is named \"Hailie's Song
Hailie\" is his daughter's name
Please turn off or put your cellphone into silent mode while the show
the \"Hailie's song
There is a huge forest which no one can trespass on its holy ground in the middle of the capital city which is well-known worldwide
The priest is a direct descendant of the the world oldest dynasty, and he is also the only emperor now exists in the whole world
There are three holly durables called \"The Three Sacred Treasures
Those are owned by the emperor and have been succeed from generation to generation
Each of them is guarded closely at the ancient sanctuaries and they are regarded untouchable
The gigantic city itself has also been closely protected by layered magics by an sublime wizard since it was established
So it is an artificial magic-defensed city
It is unprecedented scale and any other such city is no longer exist, even in the the cradle of the magic
I hate sea shepard
I feel like they are doing such things just for fun
First thing I want to insist is there is no difference between whale and cow
Biologicaly they are both classified as mumal
Do you think it can be as a reason to not kill it
We have the culture to appliciate all lives equally
April 1st is the day which called April Fools' Day
But I am not going to be fool in this journal
April is the biginning of school season
I graduated Nagoya University and got the degree of Bachelor of Engineering last month
Now I'm going graduate school of Nagoya University
I learned many things during last year
They were not only special knowledges
My aim of this year is \"learn a lot and play a lot\" by efficient time management
I'm finally over with midterms
Finally the mid-terms are done now
But not for this year
This year, it means, finally I can focus on my research
My research is about the optimization of the maintenance strategy of electrical equipments
I have no idea how to solve this yet
I have only 5 month to finish this
So I have no time to repose
I haven't touched my electrical dictionary these days
This means I haven't used English these days
Learning English is not avoidable for my future
I have to spend more time with English
It had been really cold until last week
In the meddle of April, It's usually warm enough to go out with wearing only a long-sleeved shirt or sometimes casual jacket on it in here
But the day of last week, it was so cold that I needed to wear a down jacket even it's already spring
Today, the professor of the energy trasnsforming engineering class tould us some doubt of global warming
He described it from the viewpoints of the number of the sunspots, the axis of the earth and the earth's yearly round
He said that the earth is facing the global cooling now
He said it will cause a serious cool summer all over the world
The wether forecast said tomorrow gonna be cold
I just can't wait the nice warm spring
We took part in it as the YFU which is the exchange organization that took care of me while I was staying in America
I had been told that we were supposed to explain the activities of the YFU to students  who were interested in studying abroad
We have held such a meeting last month
So we supposed that this was bound to go easily
But it wasn't
Actually this event was a kind of extracurricular activities
There were a lot of other organizations such as the group of Japanese drum players, the welfare workers and the rival organization whose name is AFS
But all of them were mostly for people who want to study abroad
So the contents of slide show which we prepared were mostly about how to apply the YFU exchange program, the history of the YFU and the structure of the organization
So it was a serious type thing and wasn't a fun thing at all
The rival organization, AFS, was doing really fun thing
We totally mistook the purport of the event
We were feeling like lying on the bed of thorns
Last Saturday, we hold a Christmas Party for exchange students
There are nine exchage students staying in this Tokai area through YFU
YFU is the one of the world's largest exchange organization
I've been staying in America for a year as a exchange student 3 years ago through YFU
I really appreciate to Them
So, to replay and express my feeling of gratitude, I'm working for YFU as a volunteer now
These exchange students are returning to their homeland at the beginning of next month
So we wanted them to have one more another precious memory of Japan
This was why we held the christmas party
About the place for party hall, a gentleman who also has the exchange experience through YFU runs a cafe at midtown Nagoya and he let us to use it for the Party
That is really nice place
It consists of nice interiors and cool drawings are painted all over the walls
Maybe these are drawn by themselves
On the very day of the Christmas Party, it was lovly,over 30 people came
There were foreign exchange students,their friends and rest of them were belong to from my age to older even over 50
We entertained them for many snacks ,juices and Japanese traditional food Temaki-Sushi
We had the game named \" Russian roulette wasabi cream puff
Wasabi is Japanese horserasish
It is really pungent
After game,we enjoyed chatting with each other and the hall kept ranging with the sound of laughter
One of the exchange students had a birthday just on that day
So we celebrate her 17th birthday with so-cute birthday cake
I hope we could make unforgettable memory for them
I wish, finally,I want to pay everyone who helped to meke such successful Party my best compliment
I parked on the street around the university
And where I parked was only 2 meters away from the crossroad
I have to pay the penalty of it.｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡
The fine of illigal parking is ￥18000
This is so expensive
But I have to accept that, otherwise I will get arrested
Oh man, If I didn't commit, I could buy an another monitor and a graphic board
Oh, and just in case, I will upload the picture of the area that you are not allowed to park
Be careful when you park your car on the road
Last week we recieved a health screening report
It showed some unusual numerical value
And doctor said he has the metastasis spread of cancer of all around his body
Doctor also said his days are numbered, 3 month at most
I'm really proud of him
He has been helping my life
When I hoped to study abroad in America, he was the one who approved and paid whole expenses
He also paid my tuition fees, and what's more he is saving to prepare for my graduate school fees
When I get back from 1year studying abroad, I visited my grandparents first
He looked at me at onece ,and suddenly he stormed about my hair color
Can you yell to your grandson you see after an interval of a year
He couldn't overlook that I seemed like I changed the identity and lost my pride in beeing Japanese
So neext day, I had my hair cut really short, and colored my hair black
Then I visit them again and apologized
Because I think it is Japanese identity
He brought up me
I had never faced such situation, someone who is really close to me is dying before
At first, I kinda lost my grasp of what I was facing
I couldn't thought with what I should tell him
Strangely enough I hadn't been terribly grieved this week
Because I was too busy at my university stuff and other work I'm responsible for it
I really appriciate what he had given to me
And his inmost thoughts are living in me
Of course I wann't going to cry
I was rather going to relieve him
When I see him and his gaunt face, I couldn't check the flow of tear
I realized what I'm facing, he is passing away
I couldn't tell him what I was going to tell well because tears kept interefering
And also I realized I can not possibly put my gratitude into words
I vowed to work as much as I can and contribute to the world to his face
Beyond that, I only could tell him \" Thank you for everyghing, everyghing you gave to me.\"  And I left his house with saying \" See you later
If I die tomorrow, I would feel I couldn't put what he had gave to me to account enough
So I decided to try to take more oppotunities to tell my friedns, my jouniors and you who is reading my diary what I learned until now
And I'll try harder to leave more things to this world
I represents my honorable grandpa
I should never disgrace his honor
Today I had my third time of the English conversation class
We talked about the article, \"Asian youth forgetting how to write
First we were given a paper which is written the article but some sentences are blanked
Then the teacher read the article to us
And we filled out the blanks
What is your favorite pan?(ﾉ´∀｀
Oh, there is a home work due next week
Then it hit me
Does anyone know this one??(；´Д｀
My favorite one is, \"There was a sign on the lawn at a drug re-hab center that said 'Keep off the Grass
Today I went to the Atsuta shrine and the Shiratori Japanese style garden
A Shinto shrine is a structure which is made as the house of kami-sama
It's placed in a hour from my house but I had never been there
As you see in the picture, that was really, really beautiful
t I felt like \"the true colors of Japan\" was there
The second picture is the oldest bridge in Nagoya
There are some rules about paying homage at a shrine
2 You have to walk left side of the road because its center is for the kami-sama to walk
Then tap your hands twice , bow and wish your desire in your heart
At this point, you shouldn't speak your wish in voice
These are some of conventions of Shinto
But I saw many people didn't follow them
Japanese style gardens are often made in imitation of the real scenery
And this is the biggest Japanese style garden in Nagoya which imitated the scenery of this area
It has quaint atmosphere
I think leaves of the trees will turn in autumn and it must be really beautiful
It's been 2 days since I met you, my brain is full of you
Because if I touch you I think everything I've established gonna collapse
That fear alienate you
If I've got on you in my birthday suit, 
with holding by you until the moon sets over the sea, and share the panorama of the color of the sky
I would've not feeling this gloom
How many times will I have sleepless nights
I cannot concentrate on anything but I'm just more in love with you
dear my new bed
I'm not in good shape
This morning I woke up with the horrible stomachache
So I ran into the bathroom as soon as I left the bed
I don't feel good since last Saturday
This happens periodically
It's like the air is being thin only around me
I can't center my focus on the studying
I made a rule! 
On the day of my birthday, I made a rule to never fail to write a jounal everyday
This was way I was in haste last night
It is the biggest priority for me to make good on my promises
But I will keep up
I will try to be undaunted
Now it's 12:30 in Japan now
I don't know what else to say
It might be the best movie I've ever watched
I have watched many movies
But I had never watched such movie before
So I don't know how to remark on it
Actually, Radiohead’s Last Flowers is used as an overture for the film
I've heard the news that Hollywood is remaking it with Daniel Radcliffe and Nicole Kidman
I'm sure it will fall
Because I'm sure that it is impossible to make this movie except for Japanese
What I'm trying to say is, even if you are a great chef, you can't make a dish of Japanese cuisine with American seasoning
Ah, I cannot express my feeling well
There is only one thing that I am clear of it
It is I am glad that I could watch this movie
After we had lunch at 矢場とん, we went to the Nagoya Castle
Perhaps I had been there before, I didn't remember anything of it
It looked with reality
Then we moved to 栄 and went to the restaurant which serves cake buffet
They served more than 15 kinds of cakes and we could eat as many as we want
They serve cream puffs, custard puddings, short cakes, and many other cakes which I had never seen before
The clerks ,customers and everyone in the house sang birthday song toghether
We had plenty of cakes and great time
Then we took 名無しさん and Porschla to the bus station and they departured to Takayama
They had a free day in Nagoya because the flight reserved would departure this afternoon

I feel tired the last few days
Our school's rock club declared that I become next year the activities leader of rock club
I have to host our club's activity of Sea Music Festival
A lots of things around me :club,schoolwork,relationships,activity
I feel so tired and I cried several times
I don't have time to do myself
How can I do
I feel so depression
how to make friends
When i am young,I find it's very easy to make a new friend
However,it's more and more hard now
Why?,I think it is because of the lack of trust
When we are litter,we even don't know what is right and what is wrong
In the other word,we can say we are childlish
But when we grow up,everything changes
In a word,i think the only way to solve this problem is empressement
But I feel very happy,because I have 
reply a letter 
Now I am thinking the reply to old lady
After the year changed, we can hear this greeting anywhere
We get new year's cards from friends and relatives at 1st jun
It is usual work in December to make these greeting cards
We write our present condition and consideration, print photo
on coloful greeting cards
I'm sorry for a long time not to contact you
All Japanese know there are a lot of people 
and we appreciate their support ongoing rescue, relief and so on

It was the last content
I wrok as a MOT(Microsoft Office Trainer
The day before yesterday, I helped to make a examination list of Pigeon Racing
The fastest pigeon can be back from 1400K far for only 2 days
I was very surprised not only the distance, but also their speed
Now I am trying to translate a letter from American old lady
But i cannot understand what she says
What does she wish her letter would be different from
She considers my letter is not good
She is a Christianity and I a Buddhist
So I wonder she intends to say Happy Xmas

Yesterday I was given a lot of adzuki bean by my neighborhood
So I tried to cook the Japanese sweet \"ZenZai\" for the first time in my life
washed beans and boiled it
I didn't know that the bean expands after boiling
As soon as my husband watch it, he shouted \" who can eat this all 
oh Wikipedia tought me Zenzai is called \"red bean soup\" 
We eat it by chopsticks 
no chinese spoon
Explain what you consider to be the normal types of pets that people could own
I think that dogs and cats are popular as pets in my country
They have been with human for long long ages
Not only because they have much been human's companion with their impression

and is the only goldfish that has the show

The babies are whole gray
About three months later, they will be colored\" my friend said
I am looking forward to bringing them up
The test place is a college where I graduated
After the test finishing, I had about an hour till my husband picked me up
So I visited a coffee shop where I sometime visited 
It is the same as a North European tableware maker
The shop keeper told me about Herend, so I told her
I sometime visited here when I was a student
We were talking our present condition each other
Thaks for a peaceful time

I'm working as aclerk in doughnut shop, but today's sales were smaller than usual (*´；ェ；｀*) 
Please come my shop
On my way home, I bought Sushi and side dish at half price in supermarket
Today, I went shopping with friend
On April 15th, a new semester begins, so I need a new bag for carrying textbooks and PC

Although there were many bags in the shops, I didn't feel their designs good
I plan to buy a bag by the internet shopping
Actually, my original name is not Don
It is Dong Chun Kim that is called in Korea as my whole name
As you feel my whole name is not as easy name to pronounce, so I have abbreviated it to Don
Wanting their offspring to live following the meaning, what the name means is the first priority when Korean fathers give name to their sons
If somebody asks me what makes me feel happy in my life, I would definitely respond that it is delicious foods that make me happy
I love not only the flavor of it, but also the atmosphere when I have it with my friends
While eating we also drink alcohol, chat and, of course, make joke
What I hate most in the Universe is the rat
No matter the size

This is the best learning way of English
Today, I had quarrel with my one of friend who i know about 2 years
I met with him on yahoo chess site, and became friend
We went to go to swimming together or beach sometimes, so at that time we are good friends
He is a foreiner and lived my country for along time, but he can not speak language so well, so usually we talk in English
But I noticed he sometimes remarks bad thing to my country, and bad things to our people
Everytimes i herad such things, it is misunderstanding, and i explaint to him , it is not true
he didnot change
The reason we quarrel each othere today is that he sometimes say sarcastic and trash talk, it is ok sometimes trash talk and say joke, but sometimes it hurts my feeling, so i asked him not to say such thing even if we are freind
But it did not work well, and our relashionship collapes
I think we can not recovery our relationship
It is really sad thing
Becase it is not easy to find foreign freind in my country
so i was happy to have a foreign freind in my country
I know diferent country have diferent coustom, thought , many thing
but i tried to look better side and keep good friendship
But i couldn't stand what he say to me and my country
Of couce i am not perfect person, there is some wrong part to me, but i couldnot accept what he said
So our relashion ship collapes
thanks reading this

I taught English to my junior high shcool studnet and I found this in the dictionary
walk' has meaning 'to make something walk
Of cource i know the meaning ' walk

Today, I went shopping to buy a key holder of　sample of food with my friend
What is “Sample of foods”
It is a fake of meals or foods like this
In Japan,　in front of restaurant’s entrance, there is often Sample of foods
It is very similar to real meals
I have heard that tourists from foreign countries are surprised to see them
And, this price is not cheap, a small key holder ’s price is over 700 yen(about 7 U
It is because, they are handmade
A professional Sample of foods maker makes every of them by their hands
We went to buy it for our native speaker teacher of Urudu
He is leaving from Japan in this winter
So we wanted to give him a thing characteristic of Japan
I start to  produce myself
Mio loves tomatomato
Mio don't like janglejim
I had to translate a poem, 'Lines Left upon a Seat in a Yew Tree' by Wordsworth into Japanese
I always struggle with the translation especially when it comes to the poetry
English is a very useful language when you try to express your feeling because one word has a lot of meanings, but when you try to analyse a poetry or something, it's so hard to find out what a word really means, I think
I would like not to mention about my study anymore now
I love both beer and wine, but recently beer doesn't suit me
maybe it's because I'm not a young enough to drink a lot of beer anymore
It was a wine from Barcerola because I remembered one of my friends from Catalonia reccomended it to me one day
I'm not sure if there is a person who is reading this
If you read this, I'm sorry my diary is not an intersting one, but I would like to reccomend you the bottle of wine about which I mentioned above

Trip to Hongkong
In fact my wife comes from Hong Kong
We are visiting her hometown in years
In the beginning, I can enjoy western styles of foods like bread, cheese, and pizza, but after sometime, I started to miss Korean foods so much
However, Korean foods were quite expensive and it is hard to find Korean restaurants
I think a lot of foreign people are facing similar difficulties in Korea if they come from some small countries
They have something like congee, a lot of noodles, and many sea oriented foods
I still remember a course of 12 dishes we had at the banquet in Hong Kong
I started to study English in my first year of the middle school
It was a lot late compared with students these days
As I know, they start to learn English much earlier age even from the pre-school or kindergarten
That may be the reason my conversation skill is not as good as my reading and writing skills
I think any language should be acquired in one's early age at least before 10 years old; otherwise, it would be a difficult task for him to speak the language fluently as native speakers do
Hopefully, I can improve my English writing skill and help other people's Korean writing
The ritual came from the Confucianism
We have grown up reading some Chinese novels like \"Sam-Kuk-Ji\", and \"Seo-U-Ki.\" Even some old people were very proud of saying they read the book series for several times
Some people have thought Chinese have a bigger body than Korean because we are in different ethnic groups
Around 10 years ago, I could have the first chance to meet Chinese, first, people from Taiwan and then main land China
They spoke a language I could never understand, which made me so wonder how people from two nations were able to communicate for several thousand years and how so many cultures could be transferred between two countries
Frankly, I got impression that they were poor and little tiny but I started to enjoy their food especially ones from \"Schezan\" area
Hello everyone
Sometimes it needs to speak English
And nowadays we have many guests from overseas　especially China & Korea
So I started to learn Korean, but it is difficult for me
I will try to write diary in Korean someday

HI every one  i want to spaker english， i hope your can help me
Today is holiday and I don't go to school
I feel so happy ^ ^ but now feel so bored
Intro
Hi
I'm new here
Trying to practice my English writing skills
I guess I have to come up with a subject I need to write about and 
hopefully it is an interesting one
What I'm having a problem with English is when to use \"the\" properly
As I write more in English, hope to learn right way to use \"the\" in the sentence
Foe  example  ,I watched  the  Website ,and   ordered  something
if  assume  here  that  it  was  a  bear  doll)  
So  I  wanted  to  call  there
If  I  said  \"Hello  my name  is,,,,   
I  am  a  Japanese
is  
or  ○×△□？
Hahaha
So  I  made  my  own English  expression , \"Hello  
When  I  ask  someone about  this  , all  answer  show  this  way
Natives  seldom  do  speak  \"As  for  ~\"  in  like  this   case
No  expression  ,which  I  can  find  in(?)  like  this  case
Please  help  me  ,if  possible briefly
What  sould  be  treated  by  us  
Excuse  me  for  my  broken  English  
Regards  about  this  probrem  and  about  correcting  my  sentences
　The  earthquake  forcast　,2011,3,14
Please  laugh  at  me  with  saying fool
I  made  a  conclusion  about  the  relation  between  the  earthquqke  and  planet location
The  last  year I  wrote  (I  may have  delate  it.) the  figures  about  grobal  potential  energy  
I  reserched  the  relation but  I  could'nt find
the  exact  frequency  about between  figures  and earthquake
Beacause  the  exception  ,most  biggest  Smatora  Ireland M9.3  , was  itself but  I  can't  find relation
The  last  year  I  wondered  that  as  for the  \"Big\" earthquake  happen  at  
after  highest or lowest  of  this  figure 
But I  can  not  exactly  trust  this  even till  now 
But the  Big earthquake  in 2010 ,and  like Kobe ,and  so  on  ,happenedly  occared  at  within one  month  before  or  later 
I have already  reserched  it  
As  sentences  may  become  so  long  ,the  following  is  my conclusion 
①　When universal  grobal potential  energy  was  around  highest  or  lowest ,the　earthquake energy  may has  thendency  that it becomes  big
②　As  for the  seabed  fault(=slit) ,which  is  compensately  vertical against  mass  cerculation(?) ,moves (Aassume
③Date  has  some  tendency  ,but  it  is  difficult to find.(becomes  too  many  daies \/per  around  it
※② is  suspecious 
※About  ①　,a  few  exception  can  not be  found  by  this  method
Please  be your  refference(s
I  thank  for  your  reading
500～600km  far  away  ,urban  location  here  in  Tokyo ,that  was  not  the  earthquake , the  warms (catapillers?) ,which  were too  many  and  which were 1m creeped  under  the  ground  south  to  north
While  30  minutes,  while  1  hour
I  regret　now
Thease  are  glasses
What'  this  -o-o- 
Thease  are  glasses 
Somebody  please  tell  me  about  ths  sperit  :these  are  
※I  have remembered  that  I  was  taught  on first  year  at  junior  
exactly  may  have  been  what  called  plural  nown 
Please  tell me  for  fixing  this  global  communication  gap  anyhow
   Today  ,it  rained
The  rain  has  been  dropped  without  stopping  
It  is  as  though  like  someone  were  fallen  the  backet  upside  down  ,in  the  sky 
The bicycle  shed  ,which  was  hit  its  roof   by  rain  ,and  it  was
so  like  musical  instrument  tympani  
  Please  tell  me  about  the  words  of  the  song  of  Doremi
I  hear  it  every  morining 
Mr
Adam 
Thank you verry much 
To make sure ,I hereby write Japanese words of the song of Doremi
ど、はドーナツのど　　(Do　of Donuits
れはレモンのれ (Re of Lemon 
みはみんなのみ (Mi of みんな＝all friends
ふぁはファイトのふぁ (Fa of Fight　
そは　そらたかく～(空高く～） (So is そらたかく＝highly in the sky
らはラッパのら～ (La of らっぱ＝trumpet
し～は幸せよ～（しあわせよ～） (Si is しあわせ＝happiness）
さあう～たい～ま～しょう(さあ歌いましょう）　　（Now let's sing 　）
どれみふぁそらしど、そ、ど！
（ドレミファソラシド、ソド　）
Please try to sing in Japanese if you remember what stated above 
I  shall add  one  more  question 
Why  do  not  they  express  like  \"Do  is  doe  ,a  famale  deer.\" as  the  sentence  in  English 
Even  I  feel   the  words  of  the  fact  for  the  words 
Are  thease  the  clauses  of  the  sentence 
Or  shorten  expression  ,as  which  I  should  think 
　　Hello
Today  is 7,August,2010

I have  been  in  poor  health 
I  wish  that  you  can  spend  wonderful
（私は）体調が悪い（たうちょうがわるい=poor  health）。
These seven hiragana are the first syllables of these important foods for health
Wakame is a kind of seaweeds and used as ingredients in miso soup
In a word, edible seaweeds is good for health
By the way, chawanmushi is the one of the most famous steamed egg dishes in Japan
And, \"まごはやさしい\" also means a Japanese passage
I'd like to take care of my health and stick it out so I can see my grandchildren smile
hello every body
Good Morning I form thailand my name is jirawut I come to here this first time for patice read wright english language for improve and devellop I hope any one help to me in the next time i will try to write beatiful place in thailand 
So all classes were canceled
I wanna go to school tomorrow
I hope sunny
Waiting him is what she hates the most
She looks again the old clock
The silence is surrounding her and she can help trembling while thinks about him
The living-room is cold, so is she
Her voice is a whisper that disappears into the living-room like a dream does when the night is over
She can stand it anymore and turn on the tv and her eyes got fixed on the screen
Breathless, she finally arrives there to find him putting his shoes off and she’s unable to control herself and holds him so tight that he can breathe
Smiling, the boy kisses her head and pulls her away softy “It’s late, you should be sleeping, no waiting for me” he says tenderly “You know I won’t be sleeping until you’ll be here” Narrowing his eyes, the boy walks through the corridor until he realizes the TV is still on
In silence, he crosses the door and his eyes glues on the screen
There, he holds her tight making her smile
“Now you’re here I can sleep”
i'm alive
i'm alive
bonjour tous
Im not dead
haha
Im hardly active on here, but i always check my inbox, messages, and watch all the new submissions
I don't like this place, it is so different from the blogs that i used before and it can't be open under other browsers except IE
All i feel here is sadness and nostalgia
However, im sure i'll upload stuff, and try to comment
All i do is stalk and +fav these days
I am an extremely positive soul now, alot has changed, alot has happened, alot has made me realise where id been going wrong for a very long time
i feel my life is alot more forfilling and just generally better
I love growing and learning, there is no better feeling then being able to look at yourself, at how you were, and how you are now, and the positive changes you are able to impliment upon yourself through time and experience
No matter how society changes, there are things which haven't changed through times; sense of following rules, morality, public mind, consideration towards others,a mind of human rights, the awe to things which have powers beyond human and love for our hometown's nature and culture
Education is being needed to foster these social characters and rich human minds according to children development stages
Long time has passed since I wrote a last diary before
As I wanna be a teacher, I definitely need to improve my English skills, especially writing n speaking skills
Is it possible that I can improve with just writing n writing, like this way
If you took bother to correct my English on this website, how would I learn from it
Just watch and say thanks
Or should I remember all mistakes
But I'm kind of depressed and am upset, not knowing what to do
If u might have any opinions, don't hesitate to tell me, please
Music preference are various depends on people
Each person has an each preference of music) 
Well, I'm not a good speaker in both English and Japanese
At the moment, I forget what a real conversation is like
It's gunna be a long story
Anyway, i can't enjoy conversations whoever I talk to
My mind wander
How would u overcome
We went to one of my favourite restaurants in Sannomiya where we ate Gyoza, Chinese dumpling
I'll tell you about this
During my class, my students had their presentations
I'll explain about this class
Well this class is International class
So some of them are very skillfull of their English and they are even better than I am
This class has 4 teachers including me
So my role is a kind of easy
I usually help them use computers
So I don't usually use English this class, which was a kind of relieving to me
After they finished thier presentation, other teachers started giving comments and feedback about their presentation
I didn't expect that I would gave comments in front of them
So when the other teacher asked me to make comments suddenly, I got so nervous 
Ah,,I very enjoyed it
I regret that I couldn't speak such an easy English and give longer, more decent and appropriate comments
i noticed that a few of them laughed at me
I want to be fluent more
Things I am concerned
I am worried about a lot of things
So I have to concentrate on my work but I am always sleepy, so i can't
I think some of you might say like this
Are you sleepy
However, for me, it is something
I really sleepy all the time during classes
i know I should concentrate on what I am doing but I can't
I even cannot speak Japanese very well when I am sleepy, though I am a Japanese
Yes I am, which is so annoying to me
This situation has happened since I got a mental sickness, which is 4 years ago
Though the sickness seemed to have disappeared already, I am still sleepy and easily get tired
So sometimes when I teach them I really get confused with what to do or what should be done in a process
That's a problem
i don't wanna look like a wierdo
I am wondering the quality of my sleep is not good enough to wake up daytime
I really want to have a sound sleep
①Although it's gradual, various trials which seek out a form of education have begun in schools of each area
If the ideas or devices of teachers and lecturers accord with the expectations from children and parents, these trials must have good effects
At first, I suggest it is important to let children study what to learn, how to think and how to express
Looking back on this 30 years, I cannot but be surprised at intensive changes of the suburbs of Tokyo
You cannot see the reminiscence of old fields unless you go far from the central of the city
For our country, it's extremely important to increase mutual understandings between nations through international exchange and advertising activities in each field and is also important to build friendly relationships based on mutual trust
i could not did my best as I was so nervous and it was partly because I realized that I was not so serious
The reason why I said i wasn't serious about taking tests is that I didn't have a specific goal for my future
It's kinda like, I felt I had been forced to do anything
It's been a big problem to me for a long time
today when I was studying English, I realized that I wasn't eligible to become a teacher because I didn't know of good conversations
I think I'm not qualified to become a teacher unless I enjoy conversations
If you don't have communication skill, you shouldn't teach
As I realized above conclusion this afternoon, I went to a church where I hung out a lot
There I decided to talk what I have in mind more positively
Next time, I'm going to talk to a person who has been attractive for me
There are something troublesome for foreigners who are going to live in Japan , one of which is a trouble because of not being good at Japanese
It is difficult for them to deal with things like garbage collecting which rules are detailed respectively each area, getting along with neighbors
Today in kobe city, we have an annual big event, Fire works Festival
So I am going to wear a yukata, which is a traditional Japanese clothes for summer
It is need to create person who can say his or her opinion, which is not borrowed from others, toward outside in English, (りっぱに？？） ,person who can explain the situation which is peculiar to Japan and convince someone
Even if a teacher have a higher skill of teaching, it might often not do well if there is no connection between a teacher and students' mind
In order that teacher's skillful questions and feedback are to be welcomed by children, mutual trust must be needed as a first step
What makes me worry about English study is that, recently the number of people who emphasize 'usefulness' on English study has been increasing and a fundamental problem of what language study means to human has been left
Family plays a very important role in the sound growth of juveniles
Parents centered family, members of which help each other, helps to foster a considerate mind towards family in child's heart
According to my experience, the possibility is very low that something you had saved before as you thought it would be useful afterward is actually useful
The reason why we make something tidy is because we reuse it afterward
You would feel refreshing if you dispose something which you decided to throw away
Regarding the title; I wanted to write 'about me of these days
Firstly I have taken some interviews and passed them
So, I'm gonna be a teacher at a high school from next year
I will try hard but I am not trying too hard so that I won't be depressed
Secondly, I visited a live show which took place in Sannnomiya city
Tha band I watched was called Kirinji, which is not so famous even among Japanese
They are consist of Horigome brothers
i have been loving them for almost 4 years
Their music is a kind of complicated
Jazz, pops, rock, fusion, techno
everything in it
Because of their high sophisticated style of music, lots of professional musicians praise them
But it's so complicated and they wouldn't show up so often on TV or any given media, 
they are not so famous
Anyway I am very fond of them
Although I usually don't like going to watch a show of any artists as I can't bear standing all the time as much as 2 hours, 
the show of Kirinji was wonderful
How can they create such an exquisite music
How would you develope listening skill of your students
It's been a long time since I wrote my diary last
The exam, which is for becoming a teacher, has been finished
It's because of interviewee's severe questions
Although it's getting cooler, the heat makes me dull all day
There are unexpectedly many people who believe that they can control
However, once they got sick, they would realize that they are dominated by the rule which they cannot control even their bodies
The ability to be loved by people is perhaps one of the most valuable ability you could equip
If it were not for the ability, your talent, no matter how wonderful it is, might be lost on large scale
You were supposed to put unburned garbage into the specific bin, weren't you
As I wrote in my last diary, students are so nice
Some are so cute that I would like go out with them if it is not illegal
I am so nervous that I can't speak Englsih well, even I can't speak Japanese well
Though I am getting used to stand and teach in front of them, still it's embarrasing and I feel nervous
I really want to get to know and make good relationship with them
However, I feek so isolated that neither I can open my heart nor relax myself
I know I should interact with ALTs and improve my English, but I'm so tired to the extent that I am not able to communicate smoothly
So I have decided to wake up more earlier and take some exercise
It is said that taking some exercise in the morning make us heathier
①In terms of history, the Democracy has been made(founded?) very recently
At the stage of the age,  among the first words what children utter, there come words such as 'my' and 'mine'  
Considering both, I prefer the latter one
We spent almost all dat practicing because it has been a long time to meet together
We are supposed to play our song in the ceremony, which wil be fun for us and guests
After the practice,we went to a Karaoke
I'm not good at singing so but I wanna be good
It would be great if anyone who see this diary correct my mistakes
I don't know whether i want to be a teacher or not in a true sense
What's worse I am getting old
It's a bit old age to change a job
And of course, under the current recession in Japan
Right now I am working as a tutor at a high school prep and so on
But the job is just only temporary one, so it's unstable, you know
I need to get a proper job enough to make a living
So once in a while I get miserably depressed
Likewise, since yesterday until this noon, I had been down
But I have realized that life is going on as it is no matter how you get depressed or how you are worried about your future
No matter how you worry, sometimes you can achieve what you want and sometimes you cannot
Still, Life will goes on
So all I have to do now is to do what I can do now
That's the essential key to the problem facing me
It's not so positive but still challenging one , isn't it
Do you have any deseases
According to the announcement of Ministry of Labor and Health, about 30 percent out of 120 million Japanese have some symptoms such as high pressure, backache(腰痛？), sore shoulder, disorder of eyes and so on because of aging, stress and overworking
Long time no see
It's been a long time to enter my diary
I think I always put the same phrase as above every time when I start this
Well, I will talk about my recent things
I've just begun teaching at high school
I am having fun at school
Students are so nice and obedient, which is very good to me because I am a beginner
But there aren's always good things
Firstly, students are very very good at English because this school is well known for its high sophisticated English education
So it's hard for me to teach them as some of them are even better than me
There are some students who grew up overseas
In terms of speaking, I am inferior to them
Today,the cold deteriorates because I helped the senior till late time yesterday
I helped to edit the video what celebrates the senior's friends getting marry
So my condition is broken at noon when I went to work
I were sleeping till I want back home this afternoon
Now that I eat some light diner ,and I will go to bed to be quiet
Trying too hard is too bad
Now JAPAN fall into serious crisis 
I am no problem because I live in Nara
But my grandfather live in Fukushima
Fukushima is very near the center of the earthquake
I only keep researching the information of this area
failures into seeds of success and bring happiness to your life
hardships of life leave you depressed, you can feel much better by 
Then, your discouraging experience can be an essential step toward the 
So, I am always trying to keep staying positive 
Now I am an optimistic person, but I used to be easily depressed by failures
However, I changed the way of thinking after listening to a speech, which is given by Steve Jobs, who is a founder and a CEO of Apple Computer
It is really impressive and gives me courage to keep 
making efforts even if I face plights
and hardships but he taught me how to handle difficulties
He established Apple Computer when he was young, and enjoyed 
But suddenly, 
Jobs became extremely distressed and lost the will to do anything
He determined to start again and 
struggled to survive, because he liked his job very much
Then, he 
launched a new company named Next and another company named 
Pixar after such a discouraging event
The company he sold has become the foundation and been playing an important role in Apple
He addressed that if he had not been fired, Apple would not have become one of the most successful companies in the world
His story demonstrates that difficulties at the time can be an 
essential link to greater happiness
Positive thinking paves the way 
for making success
Looking back in the past he realized that his 
failures were not so bad and that they are necessary step toward his 
future success
There is no need not to be depressed, because the 
sun always rises again, after all
So, don't you think that it is ridiculous to get discouraged every time a difficulty may occur
Second, do not speak depressing words
If you keep showing optimistic, your optimism grows

The website defines \"paternalism\" as the following sentences
Moreover, according to “Guide to Cross Cultural Communication” which is written by Sana Reynolds and Deborah Valentine, there are two characteristics in “paternalism”
First, people who have more powerful control less powerful people
Second, people who have the right to control less powerful people must take of them
I have defined “paternalism” up to now
Henceforth, I would like to write about a social issue in Japanese society in which I think “paternalism” is observed
I think “paternalism” is still observed in medicine
This is because the doctor has confidence in my ability
Certainly, the doctor’s decision is sometimes right, but there are a few chances to misunderstand the condition of the patient

I'll take a break for this summer and came back in September
So I said to him \"Good

Here I meant \"その調子で頑張って\" by saying \"Keep it going!\" but is it actually wrong expression
I love scandinavian funitures
In these days I am into scandinavian funitures
I love its sofisticated, cute, not get old quickly and simple design, and I feel the warmth of wood from them
Many antique scandinavian funtures are made by rosewood or mahogany or teak wood, so they have different aura toward contemporary wooden funitures
The color of the woods are intermediate between oak and walnat which are popular woods in contemporary funitures
And recently rosewood and teak are hard to find, so there are many funs for antique funitures
In some days, I would like to own Wegner’s bear chair, Finn Juhl’s poet sofa, etc
Since there are very expesive, I have to save money to get them

cuttting tomato, egg apple, mozzarella　cheese, salami
I only watched it
We put a lot of topping on the pizza and burned it
After 30 minutes, we were surprised because the pizza was burned black, especially salami
The taste was not good enough
But we enjoyed making a pizza
We will succeed it next time

Wooden musical instruments often crack because of quick change of temperature
This bamboo flute would be my grandfather's father's -and I succeeded to it as a remembracnce
Today I go to a repaire shop to ask if this bamboo flute can be repaired
Yesterday found me discussing bamboo flute's history and custom with a craftsman,teacher of bamboo flute, until the twilight

Bamboo flute is not so dificcult as you have thought
It's fascinating about 600 people in California ,according to mypupil teaching in California
I'm involved in the Revival of Orthodox Bamboo Flute in China
and so on till we noticed the twilight was coming．It was pretty constructing！
A english wordbook in japan
this book introduce slang words and lines that used in a movie \"full metal jacket
Any other
I think these books for Otaku are not suited for leaning languages
just funny
by the way
Are there such books like that in other country
and Do you want to read such wordbooks for leaning other languages
Today is a beautiful sunny day and Saturday
I usually spend  weekends to go shopping or do excacise or just relax
I always think that to keep a diary in English is a good way to plactice my English skills
But, unfortunatly, I quit in a way to do it
Therefore, I chose to join in this Lang-8
But my English was not improve, one thing that I felt is I am not afraid of  English any more even thought I could not what people said
In other words, I do not care about the surrouding people
I don't know it is good or bad
I have still been eager that I wish I could use English like as native
Second, I am going to go shopping
I hope I have a good weekend, and also all of you have that too 
在我住在的地方梅雨期完了！
本格的夏期要开始了。
为地震的影响，在日本有运动，大家节约使用的电气。
所以，在事务室里比以前轻服也可以。
但是，窗Ｔ恤不可以的，我想窗T恤做工作啊。
来中国里的话，一般大家已经做coolbiz了呀！
我看，也工作时很多人穿了很凉快的衣服啊。
As foreign people also may be so, there are a lot of situationd to use the Microsoft Power Point on presentations
The revolutionary software has been very useful to hand on information effectively and provocatively to audience
I also often use the application conveniently, although, I have a big problem with using the software when translating Japanese material into English one
I often translate Power Point documents in Japanese into English
Mistakes in a translation aren't of problems because  it's checked by a senior of mine at the end of the translation
Kanji shows many meaning by a word
Speaking to a example which I encountered today, I dealt with \"法令対応範囲.\" (6 words) It means \"scope for the enforcement by Japanese law.\" But if I try to enter the phrase in small box on a sheet of a Power Point document, the phrase can be entered with only small fonts which wouldn't be seen by remote audience when having a presentation
So how to fit a small space bothers me every time to translate Japanese into English
But my boss won't do so
I've been very busy and tired for this one week because I have several tasks that are supposed to be submitted to my boss in several days in order to promote our project
I'm very sad to be expecting to see only my daughter's good sleeping face today too
As you may know, the Japanese calender has the \"Golden week\" which is combination of national holidays in early May
But I don't like this system on which the government place many national holidays and make up consecutive holidays
Since everybody have to get off at the same time, almost all of places where people will go, such as any amusement parks, zoos, theaters, the roads people will get there and so on, would be hardly crowded
Although Japanese labor system has the same system of the \"holiday of pay\"　applied to many foreign countries which everybody can take it at will, willingly Japanese workers won't get it supposedly because Japanese has  assiduity　basically and doesn't go for acting alone such as getting a holiday with pay while co-workers works
I think this is so inefficient that We should decrease national holidays and make getting a certain number of holidays with pay obligatory
It's the center of the Golden week right now, but unlike such situation, I'm working at office as usual
This is the first diary in this site
I can't understand lang-8 system well
I've been to London UK last year for 2 month to learn English
I have only few opportunity to communicate with foreign people in English, so I think I must find or make opportunity to communicate with anyone who can use English
Oh, it's so late, I've just felt strong sleepy
Are lots of patients having allergy to pollen in your country
I've often heard allergy to pollen, especially of Japanese ceder, has become a national disease of Japanese people nowadays
On this season, by the beginning of spring, pollens of Japanese ceder is starting to fly to almost everywhere in Japan
Major symptoms are a runny nose, sneezing and itchy eyes
They are very rough symptoms
I've also haven allergy to pollen since 10 years ago
Firstly I thought I had caught cold at that day, but after weeks from the finding I realized I had been a allergy to pollen because there aren't such protracted colds
Recently I use antiallergic drugs such as a histamine-antagonizing agent and drops and a nasal drip of steroids
the symptoms can be almost controlled by them
According to a weather forecast of today, it is fine day tomorrow
Usually I can think the fine day is very good and comfortable, but only in this season I might be able to think so
Because pollens are fling anywhere and sometimes the symptoms are appearing by enormous pollens in air
I have very hard work within the last month and this situation would continue in a month
As you might know, generality of companies originated in Japan close their financial period at the end of May, which is applied in my company too
So just these day are the center of busy term for finance-related personnel -I'm also the one of the people- in a lot of Japanese companies
But for this season we can see beautiful full-blown cherry blossoms throughout along my way to my company
A mind for cherry blossoms in Japanese
I think there must be nobody of Japanese who dislike cherry blossoms
As you can find in pictures above, in this season we have a field party under cherry trees seeing the blossoms opening up on the trees or flying off
We call the party as \"花見 hanami.\" 
One week ago, I also went to a park with my wife and daughter to where it took 30 minutes by car from my home
I was very happy to see just starting the blossoms' to fall off from the branches, as if cherry blossoms are April showers
Especially Japanese people are fascinated by falling cherry blossoms
Medieval Japanese fighter 'Bushi' would have hoped to die with dignity and beauty like falling cherry blossoms during battles
As a matter of course, we haven't thought so, but I think the consideration for the 'cherry blossom' is one of precious inheriting and to inherit cultures in Japanese
Do you know the captioned phrase
As it may be known in only Japan, it's a national campaign against increasing of CO2 emission
If you want to know more information, please read the following site
thorough recycle of wastes generated on our business operation
Although I think I'm proud of our company's actions and also individually try to do them for voluntary, recently our office is so hot that I can't get out my paper fan, which is called \"団扇\" in Japanese and harness only my own power, due to a energy cut for artificial coolings
Sometimes the hotness make me thinking that we reduce of our working efficiency by 6% while we reduce of CO2 emission by 6
I'm writing a notification which informs managers of our subsidiary companies of a schedule for submission of some documents to our office
Firstly I wrote Japanese version and now I'm trying to translate it to English
But I think it's difficult due to an ambiguity of Japanese
As you may know, English word order is very strict and subjects in English play very important rolls, which are not usually omitted, I think
I was often said by my co-worker who is good at writting English that foreign people wouldn't be able to understand my text when I asked him of scanning through it  after translating Japanese to English
Sometimes children get amazingly different meaning from phrases which are spoken by adult people or TV programs
My daughter watch a TV program which is a animation program about vegetable dolls on the morning of every week days
One day pretending the narrator I said \"Have a good night!\" on watching the program
After that, my daughter abruptly said \"おかたづけ!\" As you may know, the word as Japanese means clearing off goods or toys
I didn't know why she spoke so suddenly
But a few days later I had understood the reason
She understood the meaning of \"Have a good night\" as \"Have a nainai (ないない
ないない\" is one of baby words, means cleaning off goods or toys
She could hear wrongly \"good night\" to \"nainai.\" Nowadays every just before cleaning off she said the phrase
Wife's friends, who are all women,  came to my home from Nagoya to see my wife and daughter today
My wife and them are nurses and worked in a same hospital up until 3 years ago, when we moved to Osaka from Nagoya due to my company transfer
They were surprised at my daughter's growing because I think they would have met my daughter for the first time in 2 years
My wife and I cooked some Japanese dishes, flied oyster, flied shrimp, boiled chicken with soy source, pork soup with various root vegetable and salad
They talked about some themes, such as a medical policy of the Japanese government, environments of hospitals where they were working currently and their own loves
As you may think so, the voices just came to me because I wasn't beside them, briefly, I stayed in another room in order to do my work
One of my hobbies is taking photos - especially, of my daughter
I like to take photos because a photo can have the time and the landscape nailed into a picture as if a flash freezing of the field of view through a camera's finder
Sometimes I could catch a special scene onto a photo, such as really pretty behaviors or flash mild aspect of my daughter
I've tried taking photos to keep the special scenes into still pictures because I'll show them to my daughter future
But nowadays I have only a problem with taking photos
I taking photos in RAW format
As the term \"RAW\" says, it's raw data of a camera's photosensitive element without compressing of its size
Thus each file size of photos is very large, about 15MB a photo
I didn't go to the Universal Studio Japan where I wrote that I had been going there with my pretty daughter 2 days ago
Finally I went to shopping with her and my wife
Tomorrow is the national holiday which is called National Foundation Day of Japan
I'm also day-off tomorrow
I have the Free Pass for one-year and she is free to enter it because she is young
Today I watched a film titled 'Nodame cantabile' with my family
I can highly recommend this,as we bursted into laughing
She acts really differntly in each films
Because that I thought the characters happpily make their lives with jobs which they are into
To be honnest,I want to go for a master degree in psycology,about which I dreamt at high school
But I decided to do a course in English with some reason at uni,and I've been making a progress
In my opinion,it's natural for us to make mistakes in making choices,and it's never late to let us go to the right way
But it's seemed they don't really like this idea because they believe I should make use of my English skill to make a live as long as I've studied abroad
But I also believe my experience in England is valuable not only for my job,but also my life
I know that I should go my way,but I just don't want to make them disappointed od sad by my choice
Ｉwent to a meeting of an alumni the day before yesterday
I'd been excited and actually a bit anxious,because I hadn't seen them for quite long time
But I needn't've felt so
We had a lot of fun,talking ,eating,drinking
To my supprised,four folks already have babys
There was one of the baby
ahhh someday,I also wanna bring up such an angelic baby..♥

We rarely go out at night so we are excited very well today
I will go back my parent's home
It is the costom that we go back our parent's home new year in Japan
My wife went to part time job
But I had a mistake
That's a secret for her
But I have not said that I have loved her after our wedding day
He was lucky he had a good luck
I live in Incheon far from the university

After that, I want to visit South America's countries where I've never been yet
Even though I havn't watch this match, I am pround of the whole United team
I think it is a excellent web site for who want to learn a foreign language
I used to have a blog but I am not typing it frequently
However, I will keep typing this blog since I'm loving it
Hopefully my english can be improve in the future
At the same time, babies are gifted innate humor which enables them to laugh a lot in the future
It is natural that there are crest and tough in our live
Therefore, as human beings, we may weigh down by the stress if we couldn't find a suitable way to relieve them
Some of them shout loudly or scream, some of them take a vacation, and most of the women go shopping and maximize their credit cards
There are various activities that could relive stress, but we should only consider the ways that are harmless to ourselves and the others
On the other hand, if we make good use of our sense of humor, we are not only can reduce pressure but also bring plenty of happiness to ourselves and people around us
I got a serious homesick this week and I hate this feelings
I am a patient listener but now I want to find one to share my feelings
I miss my sisters and brother
We used to fight, arguing and stole each other's chocolate and candies
I enjoy that kind of life with them
They makes me laugh all time
It is very sad to stay alone in the room without my sisters and brother
Hopefully I will survive in the next few months and I can play with them again when I go back to home
I can't get rid of them
I have been Canada for five months
I miss my family, my friends, my six dogs and the delicious food in my home town
Studying in Canada is a valuale chance for me to become mature and learn to overcome tons of difficulties and barries
This is my first time to see snow and I'm overjoyed
Canadian are friendly and nice
They always put on smiles on their faces
Last time when my friend and me was leaving the Superstore and decided to walk back to the drom, a Canadian couple drive us back
We are extremely appreciate what they did since we were cold and not used to the weather
today bad weather
i wentn to around city for shoping on boxing day
i've bought bag some cosmetics some clothes etc
All the birthday gifts I have received were few and normal
Maybe, to other people, there were no any special features in those presents
However, I thought whether a present is special or not depends on your own mind rather than other people’s opinion
Contrast to other gifts, it was the most simple and cheapest one, but it was also my favorite one
Different from those pencil boxes we can see in the bookstore, it was not made of textile but plastic
Compared with those colorful and delicate designed stationary is its simple white-black color matching and square shape
My friends usually praise my box for its cute pattern different from those monotonous logos on other pencil boxes
What a delight for me is that everybody likes the pencil box so mush and wants to buy a same one for themselves
Nevertheless, the reason why I like the present so much is not the pattern, the color or the shape, but the benediction contained in the gift
What touched me deeply was that my classmate carved some notes with best wishes in the pencil box for me
Come on,come on
Athough,english is very difficult for me
But, I must success if i try my best
Keep~!!!keep
Where there is will,there is a way
From now on,I decide to remeber some English vocabulary everyday

The Russo-Japanese War started because Japan wanted to halt the spread of the Russian expansion into East Asia
This was what Japan feared the most, because they regarded Korea and Manchuria as a buffer
If an agreement was not made soon, there was going to be a war, and this worried all of Europe because Russia was allied with France and Germany, and Japan had signed a treaty with Great Britain
Europe was worried that the war would spread around the world
It’s not that anyone sought war in both countries, but no matter what happened it’s as if the war was supposed to happen
Though these circumstances only came to be due to the old governments’ policies dating back almost half a century
The following will explain in detail the events of the Russo-Japanese war and how Japan was conceived as an “easy” enemy, but came to be acknowledged as one of the greatest military powers in the world after the apparent victory during the Battle of the Sea of Japan
My boyfriend had been a hot temper person, but he improvemented himself for staying by my side

I found his change, so I realized that my talking attitude had was too impatient
Whether I'm wrong?\" I asked
No, I think you are anger when we talked about the wretched farmers, due to you are kindhearted
I feel he is gentle unlike before, and I am be deeply touched by him
Love him so much

My interest grew stronger as your company has started launching Russian servers and hiring Russian-speaking employees
They started hiring together with preparations to launch, not if they've launched them first and then started hiring) 
During my career I have had several diverse jobs, all of them required to work in a team and to deal directly with public.(Doesn't it sound stupid or too, I don't know,  cumbersome?)I found my short-time but intensive work at Autotrade AG particularly valuable in teaching me the importance of ascertaining a variety of customers' needs and providing clear and accurate information in response to those needs
Being a part of Staff Empire recruitment agency has taught me the ability to work in a constant tensioned mode (is this \"mode\" ok
it was crazy time, always under pressure) and still being always available and helpful to (to
for?) both customers and candidates
Although I don’t have any MMORPG working experience, some of my jobs required me to deal with Internet communities using appropriate tools including forums, blogs and some others
Also, as a hobby I managed (as a moderator, how to say this
Moderated
Not sure) some game community forums
isn't this too rude
Please hire me\") I would be available for abroad travels from the beginning of June (here I mean that my international passport will be ready by that time only, but maybe it's not necessary?), and I am available for interview at any time
Yours faithfully
my very first post here
Have no idea what language should I use for Journal, my French is very poor yet, so everything I can say is something like \"je m'apelle\" or \"j'habite\" etc
I really need a good motivation to use French only
So, dear friends, please consider it \"English entry
Of course, if you can call \"nice\" this year's abnormal spring
My favorite weather site promises real summer this week, we'll see, we'll see
Tomorrow I hope to succeed with one business I really need to finish
Finally I have all papers and documents for my \"abroad-passport
I really don't know how to call it in English since there's no such term in rest of the world
And here in Russia we're still like in USSR: one passport for this country, another one for travelling abroad
Really stupid
Although I don't know if I can use it soon, I don't have spare money for any kind of far-distance trips and the situation with vacation is still unclear
Whatever, at least I will have a possibility to travel
To know I can go anywhere if I really need
That somehow makes me feel better
Couple of years ago I was very \"international\" girl, I had  penpals from many countries, it was funny and interesting
After that I created account in LiveJournal and became part of Russian community there
And I've lost everybody I was in touch with from my \"international\" part
Really miss
Even more, I started using Internet in 1999 and I started it from international part
And the truth is Internet was the main thing that made me SPEAK English, me, who was learning in from early school years but couldn't say a wold
The main mistake of our school here in teaching languages is that any foreign language is taught as a subject
As a subject that has nothing in common with you
it's pretty simple - any language is an instrument of communication
So I believe that this Lang-8 space will bring back \"International\" part back to me
Of course, i can post more or less personal blahblah things here, but I'd love to be more useful for the rest of community
For example, for those ones who's studying Russian or just interested in Russian reality
I can do small tasks, for example, to write small articles about any subject you'd love to know from Russian part, or maybe I can take pictures of special places\/things etc
Any ideas\/whishes

tTo tell the truth, I don’t what I dream to
When I was in senior high school, the only thing I want to achieve is to study in the National Taiwan University
Is it very shortsighted right
tBut I really enjoy the time that I play the piano and learn English
If this topic conclude my plan in these years, going aboard for study is what I want to do
And promote my skill at playing the piano so that passing the examination
Maybe I will understand something on the way
tI join a lot of activities, search many information from everywhere, read different books including periodical, magazine to find my life’s direction
S Since this is not the competition in the exam, I don’t want to write the fake dream like I did before

How to improve my English composition writing 
Now, I'm preparing for my one year study in America as a international student
I try my best to sharpen all my ability to make progress on my English learning
However, I ecountered a difficulty on my English writing
My teachers said my compostions have weak organization
They said my ideas and thoughts of my compositions are very confused and messy
To be honest, it really was a big impact to me
I have never known there was so many problems about my writing skill
What's more, my writing grade of TOEFL also showed my writing ability is weak
I can't use concrete and clear words to support my ideas and words usage isn't idiomatic
Due to above these reasons, I decieded to try to improve my English writing by writing diaries every day
Also, I would try to write two or three compostions and ask my teachers revise them every week
I'm starting to practice this plan
I hope it could be useful and helpful for me to improve my English writing skill

Maybe its late to talk about this year's Valentine's Day, because the day was already passed
But there were something interesting that I want to record
That day I give a call to my parents to say happy Valentine's Day
My mom said she did not receive any gifts from my dad
My Daddy is one of the traditional Chinese men
He love my mom very much, but he never, or say rarely say \"I love you\" to my mom, at least never say it when I was there with them
He prefer to cook a good dinner rather then say useless words or give useless flowers
Same as most of Chinese Traditional men
Most of whom are middle-aged
I called dad, said that he could buy a pouch of shrimps and cooked them as a gift to mom
Because in my hometown accents, \"Shrimp\" and \"flower\" have the same pronunciation, called \"Hou
So this Valentine's Day, my mom received \"Hou\" as a gift and she was very happy
My dad also very happy because the \"shrimps\" not only show his true love to my mom at the special day, but also did not wasted even a cent
Heavy Cold
I've got a heave cold last week
At first, my nose is running and I can not help sneezing
Then one night, i felt my nose was totally stopping up, I could not breath at all
I had very bad sleep these days because of the nose problem
I can not get in sleep
Even at last I get in sleep, my sleep was not deeply and I was easy to wake up
Now my head is dizzy and my hearing is poor
When people talk to me the voice is like 30 miles away from me
It sense like a piece of paper covering my ear when I am hearing
I am a poor patient now
I hate to have cold
My nose is still stopping up when i typing these words down
I wish i can get better soon

I am so happy to hear that one of my best friend will get married this October
She said all the wedding preparation will do by her and her fiance
Because in China, most parents will undertaking almost all wedding preparation instead of their children do
Now my friend has 8 month to prepare stuffs until October
So they will have very beautiful wedding photo associate with good landscape
My friend also said that she will go to buy her wedding dress after May Day Holiday
Because in China, MDH is a big holiday and almost every emploies will have 3-7 paid-holiday, that means people have free time to be invited to weddings or other big issues
So many couples will choose MDH to celebravt their weddings
That scause the price increasing of  merchandise
And after the MDH, the prices will reduce to the normal standard
Hope she can found her own style

She knew I was very impatient and not going well
Then she went to the shrine to bought an amulet and secretly sent to me
When I received the amulet and letter, I was very surprised
In the letter,she said this amulet was she specifically went to the shrine to prayed that I could going well
After reading the letter, I was very touched
So I really treasure this amulet
Until now, Whether this amulet is working or not, I still take it with me everyday

Japanese end of a sentence (笑) is used

「Did I say that　!?」
Soften feel　sentences…？
You are not a foreignly　country
This is my new band , Final Liberty, and I uploaded my new song 'Evil Braze
This song is sang by Japanese, and growl is by me
I love guitar players influenced by Van Halen, this guy is very good at making melody line 
If you watch samurai X that is called rurouni kenshin in Japan, you may listened to their song called pure feeling that is one third
They made me to make songs like Van halen firstly
I like hard rock songs more than heavy metal maybe, but sometimes I want to listened to Manowar and Judaspriest
This is my first movie that I made, music　was made by me, and movie was made by Makoto Shinkai who made great animation movies in Japan
I thought if I make some MAD movies and send to some game company,  they would think I can make some music videos
Movies with music is necessary for video games, and this skill is needed in all of game companies, so I represent them I'm good at making games
This is my first step to goal
Please talk to me by skype , my skype ID is moemoekenchang 
I live in Tokyo, mitataka city, please add me 
Tell me how to speak English
My dream is to make theme songs of  Japanese hentai games
When you think of hentai games, you'll have negative image  maybe
But among these games, stories are great and songs are melodius
For example, this is theme song of Air
It have great ryrics and great melody, don't you think so
If songs I made is listened by anime fans and game fans , that is great and this is my goal of my life
I respect people who made these songs
My purpose to start Lang-8 is to meet a lot of game fans and anime fans in abroad
I want to make hentai game in the future and make theme songs by myself
But my wish is more stronger than others
I have made this movie for youtube and nikoniko movies, check this out
This song is great
This song is great
In 80's there are a lot of great bands in metal music
When I was in high school, I listened to radio and this song was on air
I was knocked out by Vivian's greart guitar solo
This song remainds me of high school days
I don't have friends, so I played the guitar in my room and thought someday I wanted to join a band and play heavy metal
Heavy metal is my life and this song gives me power 
In a village, they can't present what they think ,because they are afraid of being hated by other
Hated people will be ignored by other
Majority decide what is wrong and what is right, minority's thinking is ignored
Since I was born, this village is uncomfortable for me
Long time to no see
I have made original song and I see you it
This song is for my new band ' Final LIberty' 
Final Liberty is made by two people, 'Koyaken who plays the guitar,and programs score by computer, and Yoryu who sings songs 
To present abstract thinkings in English
In Japan we are forced to do like others from we are born
In erementary school, we are taught to protect conformity with people in our class
For example, when athletic meet is held, we are forced to march on like soldiers  in north korean
And if you make a mistake in such situation, you are scold by teachers
Not just in school, but also amang your friends , when we go to 'KARAOKE' you must sing songs your friends know
If you sing metal songs , you are　looked coldly at by your friends
So if you were in Japan , you should take care of conformity with others
I must get up early in order to play basketball at my university's gym

Now, airlines to ensure that as much as possible for us to make and it only depends on us whether we will use this service deliberately
Quite by chance I came across on the Internet on humans, the airline employee who knows how to simply pay less

If it goes smoothly, you can enter college earlier and have 2~3 more months summer vacation
The second one is to take the DRT(Department Required Test) in each beginning of summer vacation
Moreover, the DRT always puts focus on the most difficult parts of the courses, so most of the students rather give up courses of 3rd grade than take the DRT
They only have to fill the departments they want to enter in the form on the website of UAC, and wait for the result according to their grades
In other words, the grades make the decision
I think that the first way is better because it make schools and parents help students to find their target of life earlier
High school students in Taiwan must arrive school at 7:30 every day, and stay in school for 9 hours until 17:00
The admission will improve students' motivation of learning, and it may convince parents to give their children more free time
I exactly feel some pressure
Recently I am always think of the years when i was young，which was happy ，relaxing and there was no pressure
I'm looking forward the future 
It suggest via a picture that China has the dirtiest air condition full of tiny particles all around the country
The atmosphere here is even denser than that in Sahara Desert
It is said the particles, the diameter of which is small to a certain extent, can be easily inhaled to the finest part of our lungs, called \"Alveolus\", then may trigger some serious disease like cancer
This pic was taken just now（5:30pm） at my balcony 10-storey high，Guangzhou City
The len is towards west, supposing to capture some sunset scenery but totally vague here and the sun was just missing
One may think it is froggy but truely it is not the case as the weather is extremly muggy at the moment that you feel not that easy without an air-conditioner, with a temperature up to 30c and humidity up to 80
Actually, this weather condition is called haze, a common weather situation for Guangzhou these years

There are two-side in our life
One is happy, the other is unhappy
Whenever I receive client’s complaining e-mail, I feel it is a bad day
There are many ways to make me feel better
First of all, I will analyze reasons which make me getting involve in the trouble
Then, I will discuss with our team members to solve the existing problem
I know that worrying and sadly will ruin my thinking, thought I try to avoid these one
Secondly, If I can not solve the problem by myself, I will ask my supervisor to support me
My supervisor's advice is the best solutions for me, they are true in all times
Thirdly, I will think in positive way , because i know that everything always have root causes
I can handle the problem by exploring and solving all these roots causes
In my opinion, I think we should share our problems to everyone who you trust and do not give up is the best solution for all bad cases
We have not met for nearly two years
I just remind that we had great time in California
I and my wife are working as ticket seller, our schedule is not flexible
Moreover, my children just start school in few days, thus we could not able to join your party
I am so apologize that we miss your party
PS: My children also miss your children so much
Should be nervous or happy
I just received announcement that I will attend to new project on next Monday
It means that I should have more responsible to communicate with Clients who are native speaker
I do not dare about my technical skill, because I believe I can handle this project well
Any way, I should deals with this real thing
I will try to practice English regularly, especially in writing skill the most weak I am
Totally I get home so late from my company, that why I have no time to study at English center
I am very sad today, I would like to share my feeling to you
I just  scold my younger sister
She is studying 11th grade now
She ask me allow her come to her friend hometown
If I allow her go one time, may be another time she will also do it again and again
Because we live far from our family, I have responsible to take care her
My father always expect me to take care her, I cannot reject this mission
Unluckily we meet everyday
I know how much she sad, but I have to do in this situation
I prefer become hard person at the moment rather than comfortable person
Most of people like comfortable teacher rather than strict teacher
In the future they may remind and said themselves
I wish, If I have chance, or regret for everything has gone
I have to do even I don't want, because of a promising with my father
I am strict person, am I
I just want to sleep now, may be tomorrow may be better than
My favourite plact to relax

There are no supervisor, boss or colleagues observing our steps
How about your favourite place
is it cafe, beach, whatever it will be great for us
I'm looking forward to your correction
10th entry: \"In your opinion, why people raise money for charity? Have you ever done anything to raise money for charity
There are plenty of reasons raising money for charity
The most important reason is sharing luck to the Poor
As you know, Our social is developing rapidly, thus the living cost also increase quickly
As the result, the poor people are very hard to survive
People ready to give a hand to the poor who really needs our helps
Some people have a strong believe that, if we help someone right now, we will get more in the future
This belief has proved for many years
It is the truth, when we give charity to help the poor, we feels happy ourself
I also do charity whenever I have chance
Actually we have a charity fund in our company, each staff will become a member for contributing this fund
we always help the poor, especially children who have no chance to study
We help them by providing a the necessaries things like cloths, food and books as well
In my opinion, do charity is not always by giving money to the poor
As student we can do a thing such as spend time to the poor, working at charity organization
This is the fair life
I am looking forward to receive your valuable corrections or spend time for it

Can we live without dream
The first is become an IT (information technology) teacher
In personal, I wish I will bring the knowledge to my hometown which is still poor now
I believe there is no place thirsty knowledge than my hometown
There are a lot of people who have no chance to study at good environment, because of spending most of their time for earning money for life
Parents who are really want their children can go to school as others, but they must deal with the most difficult thing is money
To become a teacher is not only help me to share knowledge with them, but also I love this job much
I wish  I can establish a small education center
One side i will teach them how to use the computer,  the other side is created job for them by getting works from other companies
To reach my dream come true, I will try to get familiar job beside the software tester I do now
Because I work far from my parent, so I can only visit them on holiday
Luckily, I was encouraged from them about opening the center in my hometown
So I can take care both of them for all my life
That’s all about my dream

After I use this site, I have more chances to read other people's essaies
I studied English by myself before I know the site, so I didn't have chances to read them
Now, I can read a lot of essaies written by English learner
And I am surprised by their writing
They don't make a mistake in the sentences and use very nice words
Expressions are also good
I think about it more and more, I lose my confidence

Then, I tried to stop using this site
When I entered the site last, I found that someone corrected my First diary

After then, I tried to make more friends
Now, I've made many friends
And I interchange a lot of emails with them
It really helps me to study Enligsh, and I also study more harder

Presentation on this thursday
This semester I should do T
works
So I have to make a presentation in front of almost 400 freshmen this thursday
Most of them are good at english because they lived in english speaking nations
Following is my script to talk
Recently
Smartphones like iPhone and social network service like Facebook and Twitter are very popular
But Don’t you thing that it is a just beginning of something 
So our objective is design the next generation social network service or social network supporting tool that can be run on smartphone or handheld device, also that uses mobile sensors actively
Most important thing is to be a creative
during the project, you may have to deal with issues like privacy, security and usability
These are examples of current services but we are expecting your more brilliant idea
Than you may beat the Mark Zuckerberg who created Facebook in his dorm room in his 23 years old and now is the youngest billionaire in the world
I thought that I'd like to start writing in English so that I can good at English like native speakers
So I searched on the Internet a paid English writing correction service and fortunately I found this site, lang-8
At first, I doubted wheather it is a weired site or not but now I am satisfied this service after using it a couple of times
The mutually beneficial concept that \"I scratch your back, you scratch mine\" is not only attractive but it works well in reality
It is not because of money or a certain rewards, It is the good mind that motivates people to do something and it makes a community
And the community gives help to all the individual members in the community again
What an attractive structure it is
Altought this site is somewhat slow and it has inconvenient interface in a way, I hope this site will be thriving
I hope this site becomes a splendid space that I can make many friends to talk and know each other, also learn english
Thanks for all friends who read this

At first,the sunshine was not very bright because of some clouds and mist around it
But when it was about 8:14,the moon was started to cover the sun
It also means the beginning of partial eclipse
And then the sun appeared gradually and it was wholly showing his face about 10:45
At this moment of his emergence,I saw clearly that from the darkness there suddenly appeared a bright ray of light which was as shining as a diamond---so great and so beautiful
Likewise,my elder sister took some exciting photoes about the wonders today,although they are not very clearly due to the annoying clouds
So,I'm also very glad to show them for all of you

They are Japanese rock band, and are composed of four players
There are many cool songs
for example, \"Fire Cracker\",\"I hate it\",\"Space Sonic
However, they broke up their band in 2008
After that dispersion, the vocal of their band, Takeshi Hosomi started new band \"the Hiatus
This band is really cool, and the atmosphere of their songs are little different from the ELLEGARDEN's that
ELLEGRDEN is known as a rock(punk) band, and most of theri songs are up-tempo
But in the Hiatus, the type of each songs are different
Even though their songs are great, I hope ELLEGARDEN would restarted the activity
Good opinion or bad opinion any opinion is okay
I want to hear many thought
I think I need to study about the Philippines so I searched information about the Philippines through the internet
I found  Makati, where I'm going to, is known as the biggest business town in the Philippines
I want to look around the traditional view and eat Philippines food
I want to get friends with them and improve my English through the conversation
Does it mean something “evil”, likely one of the biggest challenges of modern human history, one of the toughest problems humankind ever faced since it’s on a global scale, its sheer enormity and complexity
And the Earth’s getting hotter and hotter means that the more and more solar energy is accumulating inside the Earth’s atmosphere
I see, the most difficult is that they’re not concentrated enough, the energy is distributed throughout a certain area so it’s not as easy as collect a piece of coal or nuclear material and burn it up
Why do they have to resolve the question about distributed energy by the size of the “power plants” e
g
huge wind turbines… I wonder why it’s so hard to get those kinds of energy
A typical question I often find out there is money
Yes, indeed, the only guy appear to be enough of money and capability is the US
And more its government can spend hundreds of billions of dollars to wage a war on some unlucky guys in the desert of the Middle East ( another glorious victory that hardly any other nation thinks they dare to do – overthrow a government with it military power ranks 4th in just a few weeks ), but it feels reluctant to spend more money on serious scientific and technical project that possibility change the world

International friendship football game　サッカーの国際親善試合
International friendship football game of Japan vs Korea was held at Seoul yesterday
At first half, Japanese attacked aggressively with short pass but Korean defended with their tough physical
In contrast with first half, Korean possessed the ball most of all time at latter half and there were the conclusive situations to goal but Japanese defender kept no goal at the end
Though it was a friendship match, both of teams did very excited game
Since next world cup will held at Brasil in 2014, I hope both of teams improve their technique and tactics till then and can get a game beyond the final 16 which was result of this year's world cup game

As my today's challenge, I used relative pronoun, but it's uncertain how to use
I was surprised to know that she is Momoe Yamaguchi
I know her name but I had thought she was just late 70's old idol and sang popular songs on that time
Her songs are not old even now, and the sounds are really rock'n roll
During a search about her, the fact she finished her career when she was only 22 astounded me again
I like her songs as one of the good rock music
Yesterday, the AFC (Asian Football Confederation) championship semi final match between Japan and South Korea held in Qatar
But they did
During the game, Japan ran well and South Korea showed tough physical and good ability
I didn't know members of South Korea well, but after kick off the match, I was surprised they are very tall and young
They played very gentle, I want to clap and cheer them
However there was the only one disappointing thing
I thought referee got fouls easily than usual
If there was nothing, we could watch more exciting dynamic match
Anyway I'm crossing my fingers that both teams can win next games
The day before yesterday, we the lab member held the Imoni party
Imoni party is a kind of the BBQ making the pot filled with aroid, Chinese cabbage, green onion, carrot, meat, and so on and mainly organized in Tohoku region which is located in northern part of Japan
In autumn, a lot of smoke of the Imoni party can be seen every near river in Tohoku
In my living town Sendai, the pot is dressed with miso and use pork
The taste is like tonjiru which is one of the gorgeous miso soup with full of vegetables
In the neighbor prefecture Yamagata, they use the soy souse as the main dressing material and use beef
Sweetly and salty taste evoke the Sukiyaki
Since next year I am going to go to the Kanto region, this time Imoni party might be the last time for me
Imoni party was very enjoyable but that idea made me a little bit concern
The picture was shot few years ago

I am going to write about Japanese university life mainly
In Japan, there are tons of news mentioned recent difficulties for university students to hunt  job
Unfortunately, the rate of student who could get work till October in this fiscal year goes down to 58% from 63% of last year
And there are a lot of controversies about what is the main problem
There are a lot of work especially middle and small companies
They only apply big famous companies
If students learned their limitations well, they could get work
Other insist, \"There are too many students than ever
The amount of university students has been increasing, it's double compare to 1990
Now, degree of undergraduate is less special than used to be
Most of their opinions are hard for students
So, the students who are exhausted or getting angry for the job hunting took demonstration
University isn't preparation facility for hunting job
Japan is in the depression right now
In these days, my eyes have been getting tired because I've spent much time sitting in front of display
I usually experiment in lab and analysis the data by computer
When I feel being exhausted, seeing news of the world was my favorite way to rest
It was good for my feeling but not for my eyes(xx
So I bought Rubik's cube
At first, I couldn't do well though I saw the operating manual
But after exceeding 5 times making, I learned how to make Rubik's cube correctly
My next target is to make cube fast like below
Distance to him seems to be long
Sendai is getting cold a little and autumn is coming there
I like autumn because I like the color of brown and fallen leaves
Fallen leaves make me feel fragility of life
I like the sound when I step on the leaves
Anyway, I've been belonging track and field club for 11 years from the junior high school
Since I'm a relatively thin, high jump is my event ever
Today, Sendai has clear autumn sky, temperature which is not too hot or cold just right make me relax
It is very comfortable to lie on the mat of the high jump and stare absently into sky in the fair weather like today
In fact maybe over 5 or 6 hours meeting will start soon(xx
Science cafe
I am going to start the work from next year
But I'm already a little bit scared though I haven't started working and known about work　well
So I frequently imagine the past retirement years
And I like cafe, too
So I want to integrate science and cafe, and will name it science cafe
I hope there are a lot of scientific stuffs, astrometric telescope, test tube with flowers, gas burner on the table, flask as a drink shaker, and vacuum tube amplifier for good music
In holiday seasons, children come to play and study 
After the every imagination for a while, I disappoint remembering the debt for scholarship I've ever lent
If there were good application of the scientific devices for the cafe, I want to know
It has past several weeks that I had post last diary
During a recent few weeks, I had been practicing for the Ekiden meet organized by electrical faculty of the graduate university
First, I will try to explain about Ekiden simply
But the big difference between full marathon and Ekiden is running alone or not
In Ekiden, runner equips a Tasuki which is like a towel bonding its edges as a baton
To express the appearance of the Tasuki is very difficult :p
Each runner runs own course and gives the Tasuki to the next runner
So we had the Ekiden meet at last Saturday
2 years ago, we could get 5th prise and last year was 4th prise
Since we had good freshman and practice, we could get 3th prise
So, we could have the most enjoyable time in the Oden party after the Ekiden for recent 3years
I hope junior colleagues would get the more good result in next year
I'm now watching Egypt demonstration on Web TV

One day, She served the meal to him
He ate and said “Oh,this bread is nice and tastes good.”
But suddenly she got anger and said “you want to say only bread is nice and my cook isn’t good don’t you?”
He was surprised at her saying
Of course he didn’t mean it
The other day, after the meal, he said to her “I had your meal deliciously.”
and then she got angered and said “ you want to say my cook is bad and you managed to eat the meal deliciously for your effort.”
Following the day, he told me about it and told he doesn’t know what he should say
to her
Are those example just difference of thinking between men and women
or should he choose what he say carefully

When I was elementary school student, at that time rollerskating is so had populared
So I used to play with my friends every day
One day, I played with 2friends rollerskating
Suddenly I slipped and fell, my left ankle sprained
It was really really painful
Two friends approached me and said \"are you Ok?\" 
actually I wasnt ok cause I felt nearly die but I replied I'm ok
As It was so painful I couldnt dare to go home alone by walk 
but my character is a little ______(not outgoing) 
so I couldnt ask to help me
One friend said me \"shall I take you home
I said by courtesy \"no, I can go home alone\" (OK
at that time the other friend said to one friend 
dont care, she said she can go home alone
Though I was really really painful so I couldnt think anything 
but then I could think this
Bitch!!' :-(  I could certify our friendship
Anyway finally I said I will go home alone and went to home alone nealy creeping
Arrived at home I (kept my bed
confined to my bed?) and next day I wore a cast
After, though I went through that happening I got along with the other friend well but I hate her and really thanked to one friend
First, I still blamed in my mind after parted from her
but since when I dont remember her name just remember the kind friend
I watched one movie to familiar with British English accent
It's teenage movie
so, though its story is obvious, but handsome lead man made me happy:D
As I watched that movie about 4~5times, the OST is quite accustomed to hear
The band 'The stiff dylans
The man is a part of the band in movie, then they sang 2songs
One is 'Ever fallen in love', the other is 'ultraviolet
Good looking TVstar is better, but for singer, having attractive voice is best important thing to me
After watched that movie, I connected England site, because I couldnt find, download the band's songs
I found their songs more and one site where I can download variety songs
Oops, actually, 'Ever fallen in love'isnt their song and there's many version sang many singers
I love the stiff dylans' ver
Before this movie, my favorite is 'mamma mia'OST
Already as you know, all those things are ABBA's famous songs
Of course I had known their a few songs, but had done like very much
My hero is patriots
It was about second grade in elementary school when I thought about my hero at first
One day, the teacher gave me a paper which ask a few things about me
In this questions, there was this 'who do you respect
but I haven't my hero
So I started to think someone who is worthy to answer that question
I thought up soneone
He is King Seo-Jong
He made Han-gul with scholars to help his nation
At that time, we used chinese character
We borrowed and create won law to mark
But it wasn't real our's and there was lots of unlettered person yet
After I determined him of my hero, He is my hero but unreal hero
Time goes by, at high school, I liked the subject 'Korean morden history' from the era Joseon to now
Actually though I'm not good at Korean history, I used to get good grade on korean morden history
I don't know you know that (How can I revise this sentence more naturally?) korea was a colony of Japan
There were many people who flattered Japan and when Japanese chased the patriots, some traitors helped Japanese
The other side,  there were so many patriots
They resisted not just the forces also writting like poems, novels..(especially I like resistive poem
They were not afraid of death, ro rather, some patriots sacrificed themselves for contry
Can I do that if happen again
I really thanks to them and every ancestors who make efforts to protect our culture and Han-gul and so on
One thing more, It's too unpleasant to me that the descendants who is traiots' are very wealthy, as they inherited many things which got by flattering Japanese
But patriots' descendants are really poor, as their father or grandfather gave-up their family to devote himself(Usually men
Then their family couldn't afford to get education well, cause they also hard to just keep their daily meals
I want to that they get more respects
I, however, have grown up at Tokyo
Everytime I come back to Tokyo and find th Tokyo Tower, I feel relaxed
I work for a trading company which gets fossil fuel from Asian countries such as China and Indonesia, and sells them iron manufacturers, power plants, papermaking company, and so on

I'd like to briefly describe some of the chinese spring festival
I had prepared a lot of food, such as dumplings, meat balls, fish, etc in the new year's eve like previous spring festival, so that I don’t need to buy anything during the vacation
I had stick couplet on two side of the door of parents house, after then I work some firecracker, eating dumplings, spring festival gala play on TV, while my family spent whole day with my parents at their house
And my family had spend the whole day with my parents at the first day of Chinese New year
My family spend whole day with my parents in law in the at the second day of the lunar new year
I had had dinner with close friends, relation and colleagues for drinking with wine at third day, fourth day and sixth day
I had gone to  Catacombs to worship the ancester at fifth day by Tradition
I had gone to workplace start to work at seventh day
The mandarin is the language that many kinds of north nomads or minority nationality enter or invaded the Central Plains had been belonging to Han nationally in ancient Chinese, then imitate and try to speak to the ancient han nationality, then learning not too good, so became the so called mandarin
So I think that those place with dialect of south of the Yangtze River is more like or close the sound of ancient Han nationality especially cantonese and inland Min dialects almost as the ancient han nationality
Those explains Why Cantonese literature is so rich and diverse while Mandarin literature in China so poor and shallow
Maybe you want to know which animal year you belong to by Chinese 12 Animals year or Chinese 12 zodiac
The Chinese animal year resembling constellation in the west
The chinese people like to own the animal's character is his character
Chinese today are tend to contrast animal character with animal year belong to themselves

Because They didn't allow me to work part-time near my house
The volunteer is planed by my university
Because I like talk with other people
For example, I had to go home until sunset when I was a high school student
I have to go home until 10 p.m. now
And They don't like me to work part-time
I quarrelled with them about an hour
I cried a little then because They wouldn't understand me
I wanted to understand me
Then,my young brother help me
Finally,they understood me and allow me to work part-time
I want to work part-time on Wednesday,Saturday and Sunday
But they didn't allow me to do it on Sunday
But,My elder brother called them today
He is living in Nagoya to go to his university
He is 3rd grade student at a university
He said them that he would work part-time near his house
they said him \"it was good
I was angry in my heart
Today,my brother and I helped my mother make mandarin juice
But,We had to use many mandarins to make it
so we had to carry them from field to our house

After that,my brother and I had lunch
After that,my brother and I helped my father feed cows

Goog night
Kitashima who was an important person of us
The concert was held at the musical instrument musium and it was great
Three friends of mine in Hamamatsu were going to travel by a camping car the evening
They didn't plan where to stay as usual
It was extraordinalily warm and comfortable that I hadn't known at all
Next morning when the car passed over Kobe, I made my mind not to get off the car but to go to Hiroshima together with them
The water was low when we visited(I forgot how to describe this), so we were able to walk to the gate
There is a mountain called Misen where a famous Buddhism monk, Kuukai opened a saint place
It is only 500 meter something high(I don't know how to say 500何メートル
Our stomach was not big enough to taste all of them
They were going to find a good onsen or hot spring the night
I remembered that an old friend boutht a condo opposite Miyajima recently
She recommend a good onsen nearby that she just went the previous day
She never told me what to do but she was helping me make the goals clear and how to accomplish them myself
We decided which day of the week and what time we talk over the phone on what would be going regularly
The next day, Hamamatsu friends went to another island named Shodo-shima, and I took a local train back to Kobe
It cost about 4,000 yen cheaper than shinkansen, but it took over 5 hours
I couldn't buy any food or drink till the second station because of no time
5 piesces of gum eased me
I enjoyed myself looking out of the window
There were lots of green, pink and purple colours in the mountains
I went back to normal yesterday
My friends were in Shikoku now and they are going to drop by my place tomorrow
Next week after this long holiday, they are going to Tohoku, the affected area by the earthquake and tsunami, by that camping car to help them clean the damaged things
A very good news from the affected area
This is a very good news
Just now, a 80-year-old lady and a 16-year-old boy were rescued from the place under lots of debris in Ishinomaki in Miyagi pref

おひさしぶりです
It's been a while since I last wrote an entry journal here
I'm sorry I haven't replied to each message yet that I received during the period I was absent, but I really appreciated them
I'm going to have a small operation at a hospital this week
I can't seem to be able to go to Tokyo this time
Luckily, she came to Kyoto for a four-day trip this Monday, so I went to see her yesterday
There is a famous temple named of 東寺(Toji) near Kyoto station, and a big antique market is held on 21st of every month
Yesterday was the day
We met at the station about 10:30 and walked there
There were lots of people gathering and lots of stores selling old kimonos, foods, hand crafts as well as antiques
I found an interesting carved ornament which was 38,000 yen
We walked around for a while, however, there were too many people and too many things to have a careful look
Nice smell attracted us
We joined them at once
They called it いか焼き(ika-yaki), and it was quite small and 200 yen that
I thought that was why it was popular
There were chairs to sit
A foreign couple were sharing a piece sitting next us
It was interesting to see the girl taking lots of かつおぶし(katsuo-bushi) or slices of dried bonito aside
She seemed to have hated it
We also enjoyed seeing lots of statues inside the builidngs of the temple that showed 曼荼羅(Mandala) or Buddhism's heaven and earth
One of the statues named 帝釈天(Taishaku-ten) riding an elephant was really handsome
Also, we entered a five-story pagoda or 五重塔(gojuu-no-tou
I didn't know that it was built as a grave of some saints and it was burnt out four times after it was first built in 883 but it never collapsed by earthquakes
Before leaving there early 4:00, I dropped by the store again to just see the carved ornament once again, and then, surprisingly, the shope person started to give me a discount
He said, \"It is very good, but you can buy it for 8,000 yen.\" I couldn't belive it because he was going to make it 30,000 yen cheaper
I started to check it carefully, and then he even said, \"OK, it's just 7,000 yen
Please take it.\" How can you discount 31,000 yen
I talked to myself, \"Perhaps, it was not as good as the price from the beginning.\" Customer's mind, it's funny, isn't it
We took a train this time on the way back to the station, we rode only one-station distance, though
After buying 駅弁(ekiben) or colourful delicioius meal in a box, we talked again about the future planning at a cafe for a while
We had a really good time and said good-bye about 5:30 p.m
I would really appreciate if you correct wrong usages and unnatural expressions of mine
I thought it was just 'tissues' even though it is pocket-sized, but I was not sure then
How about the case of tissues, which is made of bamboo, plastic or wood
It's a lovely weekend today

For example, When I said \"go out in society\" in some sentence, He said I should use \"start working\" in stead
In addition, he also said \"international situation\" can be paraphrase \"what's going on in the world\", and \"feature\" can  said \"what makes us different
I become stressed when I learn the way of thinking that are shown in the expression of Japanese and English languages

According to an  korean article, 40 percentage of overweight people are  in the world and the number is  increase rapidly
some peole say that, obesity  cause not only   diseases but also lose  self -confident
so,  what sould peole do to reduce a weight 
To begin with, the  most important   thing  is to make a plane for diet
As you know, obesty people prefer high calories foods such as hot-dog, pizza, chocolate
They have to limit for  eating those  food  to avoid fat 
when they buy foods 
After then, make a list a  diet card and put it  on a fridge
They can check daily intake of  foods
It is  essential to pretect  gluttony
Second, they need to  exercise regulary
the expert say that only  law calorie food is   not  enough to  lose  weight
Exercise and  diet food sould go hand   in hand 
However, some of fatness people avoid physical exercise because, they get diseases alredy  such as   hypertension and  rheumatism 
Also  most of them just  keep away  exercise steadily
Taking a exercise should   encourage to take off  fat and for  stimulattion blood circulation 
Third,  attending a group meeting  is a  good way to mindcontrol 
they can share variety of  imformation  with  different experience
Morever,  if  they  know  who  succed  in   diet    it  will be a  good role model for  them
In conclusion,  and i mentioned, im strongly suggest  to overweight poeple who want to   live for  health life
They will spend  tough time to make a goal  
however ,  if   you  control  your minds  and  body condition, you will be successful  
no gains no pains

Do you think Japanese government should accept more immigrants
I agree with the statement that Japanese should accept more immigrants from abroad to solve problems of declining birthrate and aging population
A number of immigrants want jobs in Japan and they work hard because they want to make change
However in other ways, for example, raising taxes would end up to force people live less happily
I don't want to work after I get 65 yeas old because of lack of the savings and decreased pension
On the contrary, what is the problem of accepting more immigrants
These problems are not big deal
We will be able to solve them by discussing and understanding of cultural differences of each other
All in all, immigrants are powerful solution for aging society
Japanese government should change the policy
Talking with foreigners is much fun
Why don't we live together and make wonderful life with cultural exchange

He brought to me two good news
One news was that he had a baby boy on Friday night, just two days before
It was a good glad news
Another was that one of our friends got married last week
He said to me directly nothing about his marriage, so it was surprising for me
Yes, I was very glad to hear these good news
It is a bad manner to chew gums loudly with a mouth open
They come to the office, sit at their desk, open a bottle of chewing gums, and begin loudly chewing almost every morning
The loud noise bothers me and hinders to concentrate on my work
I don't want to argue them on such a silly slight trivial thing, so I push earplugs into my ear canals everyday
I can concentrate on my job and improve in efficiency more than expected with wearing the earplugs
Why don't you try it, if you want to concentrate on anything
We discussed with our colaboratory members in Netherlands
We could discuss with foreign researchers at Japan office
We need not to go to Netherlands, and they need not go to Japan
In the truth, I want to go there once
Anyway, we had a very fruitful exciting discussion yesterday
I was sorry I was not used to the web meeting, I could not speak well
I thought I have to speak more and I want to be able to speak more in English
Wow, it started raining again right now
The sun and the rain in the summer should be necessary for producing crops in the autumn and so on
We have to take care not to get heat attack and enjoy this hot summer
We have a busy week, and at last it is Friday, that is the day before weekend
We deserve to refresh or enjoy on the weekend if we have done hard work during the week
Today is the last day before summer holidays
I can't wait tomorrow
We will have some cleaning and checkup facilities in our lab today
I will have some meeting and interview, too
However, it's Friday before summer holidays
Anyway, after the work, I will step into summer holidays
We played on a well treated beautiful lawn playground
Clay one are common
Lawn grounds are softer and more comfortable than clay one, but treatments are more necessary for keeping the ground conditions
I read some books in these days during the summer vacation
Essays and novels, including classic novels and recent hit novels, were read
Some were interesting, the others were difficult so as to want to read again, and rest were just time-killing
I read the books in the train and in home at night
When I was reading, sometimes I dropped off to sleep
I went  slipping into the novel's story world
Or I got bored of the book and had a nap
Too difficult ones and too boring ones were good for dozing off
Please read good books and have a good sleep as well
For practicing for next month's half marathon
I ran on the actual course of the next month's half marathon with more than ten friends for practicing
At not so fast pace, we sometimes chatted while running
We will run a half marathon or a 10km race on the race day
We made a good preparation for them
We saw plum blossoms and early cherry blossoms blooming on the way
We had a running event, but it was heavily raining unfortunately
However, we are crazy for running, so over 20 runners, including me, joined the event and ran in the pouring rain
The road seemed like a river with flood
Some cars threw water to us from pods
I was sure we looked stupid
But we really enjoyed running the full marathon in the bad and funny condition
After the goal of the marathon, we went to a hot spa and enjoyed it
I went to watch the \"Super-8\" movie yesterday
I think I should not say the story here in detail
It is made from some previous movies by Spielberg
It is said adequate workout help you keeping your health
I think walking is the easiest workout for almost everyone from young to old people
The pedometer count your steps when you put on it automatically
It is fun, even funner than expected
I recommend that
More than ten thousands steps a day is appreciate daily target to achieve
I entered for the next Tokyo Marathon
It will be held in the next February
The entrants will be chosen by lottery
I could run the last one luckily
They say that there is the way to make your dream come true, which consists of very simple three steps
First, note your dream down on a paper
Second, put the paper on the wall and see it everyday
Well, I got it, I think it would be sure to succeed
I will write my dream on a pad to realize it
The dream, or the goal, would be preferable to being SMART
That is written in some books of self-development
We have the Hydrangea Festival in the town next to my city on last weekend and this weekend
Hydrangea is very popular in Japan
It blooms in June and is the symbol of the rainy season
Red, blue, purple, pink, white, many various colored flowers are very cute and beautiful with its vigorous green leaves especially in the rain
Its flowers is said to vary its colors by the pH of the soil
At the festival, we have some ceremonies, concert, and the other events as well as free appreciation of  hydrangeas planted along the street and footpaths between rice fields
At first, cutting its branches, arranging about 10cm length, cutting the edge sharply, and sticking them into soil in small pot, and then watering enough not to dry up for some weeks
Some of the branches took root successfully and grows in the pots
Winter returned here
Take good care not to get cold, everyone
By the way, do you know of \"Nagori-yuki
Yuki\" means snow, \"Nagori\" means like lingering farewell, I think
Nagori-yuki\" is a kind of snowfall in spring
It sometimes snows in March around Tokyo, or also in southern part of Japan
In March, spring has already come, and no snow are there usually
In spring, we start a new life, like entering schools, getting new jobs, therefore we may have to move to new places
We may have to leave someone then
There might be a sentimental scenes here and there
We are reluctant to leave them at a station platform or somewhere
Just at the moment, it starts snowing sentimentally even dramatically
We call the snow \"Nagori-yuki
So it doesn't mean just snow in spring
Some sentimental meaning is included in \"Nagori-yuki
Nagori- yuki\" is the name of a popular song originally, I'm sorry I'm not sure
My own \"Nagori-yuki\" was
at a long long time ago
I had left my girlfriend at a station platform of my hometown and came to Tokyo about quarter century ago
Anyway, it is one of my precious memories, hahaha
Is it unconscious or conscious
Yes, I did it rather consciously
I have to make it a habit to wake up early absolutely
My older friends came back to my office
An older friends of mine, who had retired from work two years ago, came back to work at our section as a senior stuff from yesterday
He had been also the former manager of our soccer club
I like him and respect him
So I feel surprised and a little difficulty to work with him right now, but I am sure we will be able to get along at our work
Saturday is a holiday from work for our office usually
It is a substitution for the day that we can't work due to the rotational power cut
We have an occasional working calendar corresponding the rotational power cut
Yesterday was a rest day
I enjoyed gardening yesterday
Picking up weeds, cutting grass, trimming some branches of trees, watering and fertilizing them, blur, blur, blur
By the way, we have holidays called \"Golden Week\" from yesterday April 29th, that is \"Midori no hi\", to May 5th, \"Kodomo no hi\", in Japan
I took a day off today, so I have seven-day consecutive holidays
Haha, not any
Each of my family has stuffs of themselves respectively
So we can't go on a trip to somewhere altogether
But I will go cycling to Kamakura with my wife
The short trip by bike is annual event of us two
I signed up for Tokyo Yumemai Marathon on Oct
I am going to run 4 times
Not a time race, but an interesting 42.195km sight seeing race
Expensive purses will make you rich
Your attitude and behavior, which the purse bring you, may make you an rich person
Expensive purses suit only rich people, which I agree with, but I can't believe the purses you make rich
The first working day in 2011
Today is the first working day in 2011 of my office
I have to work hard, as hard as last year, or rather harder
Anyway, I am afraid it will be very cold in the building after several holidays without heating, you know
Since I got the new tasks, new goals, new schedule, and new coworkers, I have a lot of things to learn about my new work
Moreover, I have a lot of various things which are new for me every day, even every hour
With my previous work at the former section, I rarely went to the headquarters
It was only once per two or three years, I'm not sure
On the other hand, with the new work, I go there once per two or three weeks
I'm afraid I don't like taking a train very much, especially crowded trains in metropolitan area
Overslept
The electric power was planed to cut off yesterday evening, but it was cancelled at my place luckily
We have hand lights in our house for the power cut
There is one this evening today
Fuji, that is the highest mountain in Japan as you know
I write it because I can remember a dream unusually
In my dream, I watched a football game of Japan versus England national team on TV
Japan team got goals on and on
A sportscaster was very excited and shouted at every goal
When scored 5-1, I awoke from the dream and got up
I wonder what mine was, getting the dream like this
Natalie Portman as the heroine acts the main ballerina of the Swan Lake ballet
She got the Academy Award through this roll
The movie was very interesting and it was for matured people because it contained some scenes which are not good for child
I went to my office after the 4 day business trip today
Some time flied at the office in my absence
My busyness is still, or even increased unfortunately
It seems never-ended
Some grass turn yellow in this hot summer
It has been beautiful green in the winter and the spring
However, I got an useful information
It is called a burn by fertilizer
We must not apply fertilizer too much to grass especially in the mid summer
A lot of plants become vigorous in these days in our garden
There are Lawn grasses, rosemaries, lavenders, daisies, hedge trees, and so on, including many plants which name I don't know
New buds and leaves are budding there
We feel happy in the Spring while seeing them growing up with vigor
Have nice Spring days, all friends
I took a TOEIC test after work yesterday
I am afraid if I could have done it well but I got it done anyway
We have to concentrate on the the speaker's voice of the listening test especially, but it was hard for me to do so yesterday
I suppose you that you had better not take like this tough test on Friday evening after work
It is because you would probably be tired from the all week work and surely find it difficult to concentrate on your test for a long time
I could rather enjoy taking the test this time
I like English more than before
That seems why I could enjoy the test
That is thanks to you here in Lang-8, even partly at least
I appreciate you from my heart
The result will be received in two weeks
I wonder if I could get a higher score than before or not
The exhibitions consisted of three of them, which were new generation lights, functional films, and these manufacturing technologies
The lights section showed us many kinds of lights of the new generation
Those were mainly LEDs and organic LEDs
LEDs consumes much lower electricity power than fluorescent light tubes
They also demonstrated a large size of the 3D displays which we don't need to wear 3D glasses to watch
The largest one was 70 inch size
I got a kindle
I was sure that it is very good device
The electric paper display is very easy to read, even easier than LCD displays of PCs
I love it at the first sight
I will read books written in English and improve my English skill
Fruitful visit to representative offices
We went three ones, which are from Belgium, Finland and Germany
And the representative person who talked with us were Japaneses or foreigners from their country
Thanks to study here in lang-8, I could managed to have discussion in English
The discussions mainly consisted of introduction and presentation about the institutes and the activities of them, and we made many questions
We could have very fruitful discussion and got a lot of new informations and knowledges
We had good visits there
I would like to visit the foreign research institute in their own countries and know more about them
There are a small path named \"Omoide-Yokocho\" in the western side of Shinjuku Station
The path and bars have Showa Retro Style, it looks like it is not changed for long time from Showa era
It was my first visit to the path
We enjoyed drinking some beer and other drinks and yakitoris  with very reasonable price
I want to go for Karaoke to refresh myself
I like Karaoke, but it's a long time since the last time I went singing to Karaoke
I guess that singing songs loudly is very fun and very good for refreshing
I think it is one of the greatest inventions of Japan
How do you like Karaoke
He will quit a job at our office at the end of March
He is one of the targets of corporate restructuring
He leaves for another job
We, he and I, have been at the same group for about five years, since 2005
He was a group leader of our group
Therefore, I got shocked and felt something betrayed when I heard the news of his change of job
To say the truth, I was sorry I didn't think he was enough to be a leader of our group, so I often argued with him about the management
But this is also true that I respect him a lot as a good engineer and I like him as a good elder friend
Anyway, we miss him
We wish his every success in his new job as well as his health
Best wishes for him 
I ran a marathon, 42.195km, yesterday
It was too hot to run a long distance, even to do any other exercise outdoors
I poured water over my head some times too
I ran in the shade as possible to minimize the exposure to direct sunlight
It was very tough again, but I did it
I want a good boots
I am planning to buy a boots
I am wondering which boots I will buy, and browsing on the web
For example, as for work boots, there are many types of work boots
I can't decide which one to get yet
March 21th is the Spring Equinox Day
The day time and the night time are equal on the Spring Equinox day
We have three straight holidays
Today is the last day of the holidays
I have a lot of stuffs to do
We took 3D glasses to watch it
The computer graphics are very beautiful and look nearly real
The story is fun and easy to understand
It is impressive with its theme between the human as invaders and the former inhabitants on the planet
I guess it is one of the \"must see\" movies
The battery was dead in the train back home yesterday
What do you think of that

Longing for good news
He has been very nervous these couple of days
But it seemed to me that he was enjoying getting nervous
According to him, he can NOT be nervous before the exams, because that may affects his performances, but before the announcements, he doesn't need to be anxious for his performances, so he CAN get nervous without restraint
He believes he can pass the examination
He says he is confident to have got it done well
He  is well optimistic
The announcement will be conduct at the university at about 1 o'clock today
I really hope he can pass it
I'm sure he will
I can't help waiting the news
I AM also nervous
I use up ballpoint pens and replace the refills
That is a trivial thing, I know
I will replace to a new refill into the 100yen ballpoint pen
It is a kind of the ecology
We have a lot of work for an important decision making next week
We spent a lot of time for discussing, researching, and making reports and agendas for it
Unfortunately, the progress of our work is not working as well as expected
I think this seems usual
Besides, I had job interviews as an interviewer with applicants from universities
I left home to my office at six in the morning
I left my office to a business trip at seven
I left the visit to my office at noon
I left my office to home at a few minute to the  midnight
Somewhat tough for me as a convalescent
It was too hot to have a good sleep last night
I woke up sometimes
I got out of bed to turn on the fan at last
We will have some sleepless night in the summer
To mow the loan
It is two week after last mowing
To cut branches of a berry tree
It grows very fast in this season
To wash my car
I think it is about a month after last time
To clean my desk and my room
To watch dramas and movies recorded in the HDD recorder
I want to do, but I can't do this probably
To go for a jog for refreshing myself
To buy my daughter a new pair of running shoes
To have a good relax time and have some rest
How to manage to change sports outfits into office clothes
I run to work and back home almost everyday
It is a great way to start a new day and finish work of the day
I can change my mind by running from the working mode to the private mode and vice versa
I introduce you how I manage to change my sports outfits into my office clothes
I can't work at office in my dirty wet sport outfits, it's weird, you know
Luckily, there is a locker for me at a locker room in my office building
I change my sport outfits to my office uniforms there
I bring some extra sport outfits like shirts and shorts and underwear with me in my backpack every morning, and keep them in my locker
So I can run back home in clean dry outfits
I also have to change my sweaty underwear to clean one some times in a day in warm season
And after finishing my work in the office uniforms, I run back home while bringing the dirty wet outfits and underwear back home everyday in my backpack
There must not be limits for anything
You only set the limits on yourself to do anything
You have infinite abilities and possibilities for everything
You can do anything you want to do and you can get it done better than you thought
Therefore you have to try and push on while getting your limits off
What do you think about it
I usually end up setting limits on myself for doing something
Those \"you\" are suitable for  these sentences
Or \"we\" are better than \"you
Busy week
Another busy week started
It was just midnight when I arrived at home after the long long riding train from the business trip
We hope spring come soon. 
Plum flowers has been blooming for several days
We hope spring come soon
But I feel hay flies in the air
I have to put on masks in spring
I want to enjoy taking photo with M42 lenses again
I have sold some of my M42 lenses out of my collection
I used them before, but I hadn't used them for more than five years
Well, while selling the lenses, I feel like taking photographs with those lenses by myself again
Therefore I bought an used digital camera and a mount adapter for old M42 mount lenses
Digital camera is cheaper and more affordable than 5 years ago
And it does not need the development cost
I got an used one with a very reasonable price
I write my journals almost everyday
And my posts are corrected and commented by someone
I am sorry I have neither time nor idea for posting today
The Somei-Yoshino kind of cherry trees are now on time
We enjoy seeing and drinking some alcohol
24h relay marathon
We signed up for the 24 hours relay marathon held at Hiratsuka Sougou Kouen Park on September
Eight runners in our team will run the relay
What do you think about a 24 hours relay
Sounds like that exciting, doesn't it
It will be very tough, even extremely tough, but at the same time, it may probably be a funny and enjoyable event like some big festivals
We will enjoy running and also rest time with buddies
It is my first 24 hours relay
Do you know the internet banking service
I have a bank account on one of the internet banks
But I found it useful, for example, to pay through a bank transfer for internet shopping
I bought something by bank transfer via the internet banking
It was cloudy and chilly but little windy, so it was a good condition for running
I ran three marathons in a week, which are on Saturday, Sunday, and Thursday
It is incredible to run 100 marathons every single 100day in a row
He is an incredible 60's
Acupuncture ease her
My daughter received acupuncture to ease her recent mental condition, like nervous and  irritating, and unstable
The acupuncture worked to her surprisingly very well
She got better and much more positive as before
I'm not sure but I think she had some tense or fatigue in her body, which brought her nervous, anxious, and another negative feelings
The acupuncture arranged and cured her tense of nerve, I don't know well
It seems like the summer is back
The temperature in the daytime is more than 30 degrees
However, it is cooler in the morning and evening with pleasant autumn breeze
We also feel pleasant breeze in the shade even in the daytime
One of our colleague will leave our laboratory on the end of this week
She has been working in our laboratory as a temp staff, and she found her permanent job
We are very sorry to lose her but very pleased that she get her new job she has wanted
Well, I drank too much yesterday, I have some hangover now
We should have face-to-face communication
Got flu
My son got flu
He has some fever, throat pain and fatigue, but they all are not severe
He took the effective medicine, Tamiflu, and has been resting in bed
I hope he would get well soon
And we are afraid if his flu would infect my daughter
Because she has an interview of the entrance exam to the high school next Monday
In recently, I wrote bad to whom chews loudly here, so does God punish me with this
Gave the lawn a fertilizer
I gave the lawn a fertilizer this morning
First, about 10 gram powder of urea fertilizer, which is two or three scoops by a tablespoon, was solved and diluted to 5 litters of water in a watering pot
And the dilute solution of the fertilizer was given to the lawn, 2 to 3 litters per a square meters
This urea fertilizer is very efficient for the growth of the grass, especially good for greening the leaves
The lawn in my garden turned yellow by the severe heat in this summer
So I'd like to make them recover and want to green them again
I wish the fertilizer help them recover
Finding a apartment for my son
I went to Tokyo for finding an apartment for my son who will start a new single life in Tokyo
It is his first time to live alone
We were very lucky to have found a very nice one and sighed up for it
I feel kind of lonely for missing him
We hope he is growing up to be an nice adult
Warlords and us at Odawara 2-Day March
This photo was taken at the finish point of the route after 20km walk
They were stuffs of the event who costumed as warlords of the Sengoku era which was several hundred years ago
The white wall with the piled stones was a part of the Odawara castle
Maybe we also had to put on protectors and helmets like them, hadn't we
Just to tell you, usual Japanese like us don't have such uniforms and protectors, of course
That's why I turned to a shorter route to the office and ran in the rain sometimes with an umbrella and sometimes not
I was not very soaked when arrived at the office
No, not only these days, but almost all days, I am busy
I worked long overtime this week, especially
I was at office until around the midnight some days in a week
I am now suffering from some lack of sleep
I will have some rest on this weekend
Have a good Friday and good weekend, all my friends
Get and Sell on the internet auction
I get some goods on internet auctions, for example, used watches, shoes, clothes, cameras, and so on
It is good enough to get something at reasonable price
And sometimes I sell something I don't use any more on internet auctions
It is very good way to reuse things and to clean my house
I sold ten old cameras of my collection recently
I didn't think no one would want them, but almost all of them were bid and sold
To reduce wastes, to reuse things, and to recycle is good way to reduce carbon dioxide and is eco-friendly
Do you know how to cheer yourself up when you are in a tough, difficult, hard situation, or something like that 
I have the magic words for cheering me up
I tell you what
The words are 
It's a showtime 
I suggest you to say the words to yourself when you find yourself in tough situations
If you say so, you could make you stronger to conquer something such as a problem and you could succeed in ending it or dealing with it successfully, I believe
It is very easy for you to say only a few words, isn't it
Graduation ceremony of my daughter
There will be the graduation ceremony of my daughter's junior high school
There was one of my son's high just some days ago
My wife and I will attend it this time
My daughter will play the piano accompaniment at the ceremony
She is good at playing the piano
I am looking forward to her play there
A lang-8 friend crayonmaster taught me that graduates throw their hats into the air at the graduation ceremony in States
I have seen this in the movie \"An Officer and a Gentleman
It was very impressive scene
I like the movie
By the way, come to think of it, as an interesting custom at the graduation, a girl graduate ask a boy of her love or especially her one-side love to give her the button on the uniform as a memory on the graduation day
We will have a brief meeting in this morning about the personnel transfer, maybe
Someone seems to transfer to another department
Or someone will come from another department
Certainly, it is not me at this time
My driving licence card has built-in IC chip
I can't remind them
They must be numbers of my kid's birthdays
I was very exciting when I open the envelope that the result sheet was in
Well, I could renew my personal record of the TOEIC score
My score was decreasing on the last two tests
So I studied harder to get better score
I was very proud of my effort for the test
And I think it was thanks to you all my friends here in Lang-8
Overslept again and again
I wonder if I am tired or for lack of sleep
I feel hard to get up early especially in winter
The warm bed grubs and doesn't release me
I have sore muscles here and there in my lower body, which are lower front of thighs, upper front of thighs, back of thighs, carves, soles of feet, buttocks, and lower back
Those are almost throughout my lower body
Especially I feel sore in lower front of thighs
I ask you a question
Please let me know how to express the severeness of pain in English
How do you say about pain
I will be grateful if you teach me about this
We had heavy rain in Japan, especially in Kanto Area these days
They were seriously heavy
The roads sank and the houses had water on the floors
The heavy rain suddenly starts and falls seriously heavily, we call it guerrilla rain
I went to see the movie; Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
It was long, over two and half hours, but didn't feel so long, because it was very  speedy and exciting
The images were also excellently shown as the world of the original book
I can't wait the 2nd half of the movie which will be roadshowed next summer
I went for dinner with my colleagues who will transfer to another section on April 1st
They have been my staff for just one year
I feel sorry for their transfer
I hope they will make good job at their next sections
For example, 15hour a day
So I have to go to our laboratory early in the morning to start the experimental equipments and to stay till late at night to stop them
I have to repeat them every day, including Saturday and Sunday
We will run on the 1.73km lap route around the baseball stadium and soccer studium in Hiratsuka Sougou Kouen Park
We compete how many laps we can run in 24 hours
Over 150 teams seems to participate in the relay
I was tripped and about to fall down on the way from the station to my office yesterday morning
I was walking without thinking anything then
My foot was tripped a small kink
It is hot summer and we are easy to get lack of sleep, please take care while walking, riding, driving or doing anything
Yesterday was a non overwork day of our office
Wednesday is the non overwork day
But in spite of that, I overworked a lot until 11 p.m. I worked in the empty office
I was fatigued
To tell the truth, I didn't have the non overwork days of my own since April
I overworked on every Wednesday, furthermore, even until late at night
It is because I have weekly meetings in the Thursday morning
I have to make weekly reports for the meetings in Wednesday evening
We have cold days as in winter recently, but some spring buds and flowers at the same time
We find spring has come here certainly
Lawn in my yard is turning green from yellow these days
Ceder pollen fly into the air by wind and cause our hay fever
I am also bothered with hay fever
Seriously hot marathon
I ran a marathon race yesterday
We hydrated much more than usual and paced down
We enjoyed ourselves to run very much
There is only a day away before the test
I want to get better score than the last time, at least
We place a stack of round rice cakes at every house or family to offer to the deities which come on New Years' days
The stack of rice cakes is called 'Kagami-mochi', which consists of three parts, that is a bigger round cake, a smaller one which is stacked on the bigger one, a orange which is stacked on the smaller one
The New Years's days come to end with some ceremonies including this 'Kagami-biraki' and 'Dondo-yaki', as introduced before, in Japan
She wants to go shopping to buy some books and some interior goods and to play karaoke
It will start to sign up for Tokyo marathon, which will be held next March, at 10 am today
I have run once three years ago
I have had some headache, coughs, sluggishness and heavy sleepiness these couple of days
Did I catch cold
Or did it caused by some lack of sleep or so
I went to see a doctor and got some medicines, which were cough medicine, throat medicine, and cold medicine
Labor thanksgiving day
Today, November 23th is Labor thanksgiving day
Thanks all labors
I am having a good rest day today, too
I will not go to office today, never
To tell the truth, my office is not available today, because it is now under moving
We can easily notice whether he (she) is a freshman or not, eh
I got up to go out and my son came back home right now
It is a Friday midnight
I will go to run a 112km ultra marathon today
Please give me more power and strength, both physically and mentally
I ran in a marathon race yesterday as described in yesterday's journal
That is my last race in 2009
I participated in just 30 races in 2009 
Am I a race freak, a race dependence or something like that 
I myself think I am a run freak, may be a run dependence,  to some extent
To tell the truth, I don't like race against another person very much
I like running slowly as well as jogging better with thinking various things alone and with not thinking anything
When I am running, I can have my own time for only myself
It probably means we will feel hard in the 42.195km, that means a full marathon, of course, but it is very short time compared with whole life, so it is short enough to bear it, or it is very short to enjoy it
The marathon race is the Kintarou Marathon
It will be held on next May 16th. 
We have 2km for kids, 5km, 10km and 15km race
The total of entrants are more than 2800 last year
We shared the outline of it today and checked the marathon course with walking the actual course
Total distance is about 10km
Easy pace and felt good
Today's party is easier one with my friends
They and I were also colleagues at my former office, but we are now kindred-spirit friends
Today's party is farewell party for celebrating his mandatory retirement and honoring, appreciating his long time efforts
But it will be absolutely casual, frank, and happy party
I am looking forward to seeing friends who hasn't seen me for a while at the party
I went to a party on a week ago Wednesday, didn't I
Not same \"a week ago Wed
and last Wed.?) That was one with my colleague at my present office for making better more nomi-nication I myself planned
Do you think I have a lot of parties
No, I have less than once a month on average
On the wagon\" is interesting phrase, isn't it
it means \"stop drinking\", \"no drinking\" alcohol
Anyway, I would enjoy the party this evening
I wanted to report you a good and positive story, so I could hang in there, keep running to the finish gate instead of give-up
I am very much happy to have get it done
And I am very pleased to have posted good news as well
I am bothering from bad coughs these days, I think it is more than three weeks
The clinic was full of patients and I had to wait for about one and half hour there before seeing the doctor
He checked my throat, the sound of my chest, and took the X-ray photo of my lung, and then said it was not serious and I had to take some medicines
I hope my cough leave me soon
I had planned a casual party at a Chinese restaurant to enhance the friendship among us
My coworker and I enjoyed delicious Chinese cuisine and drinks, and we enjoyed chatting about various things around us
I will plan the next event soon again
We have the reunion party of our high school today
It is the one of the annual parties for alumni in the Tokyo area held in every spring and every autumn
Our high school is in Hiroshima, which is famous for peace something, which is located about 1000km east to Tokyo
I can be able to see my friends today after a long while
Furthermore, our reunion soccer club have soccer games in the morning
I will take part in it, of course
I am looking forward to it very much, too
The soccer games in the morning, and the reunion party at night with my old friends will take me home in my youth
Should it be sounds fun
I can't help waiting
Yesterday was the day of the harvest moon in Japan, called \"Chushu no meigetsu
We have the brightest and most beautiful sight of the moon throughout a year
I jogged back home from work under the harvest moon shining very brightly and beautifully
We celebrate the growth and health of girls while displaying many beautiful Hina dolls at each family
Odairi-sama and Ohina-sama, Which are the Emperor and the Empress, and many servants are set on the five or seven tiered platform
My family used to displayed simply two Hina dolles which are the Odairi-sama  and the Ohinasama  for my daughter
Happy birthday to dad
I hope he will live long time without diseases
I'm sure spring will come here in our place soon
Early kind of sakura is now start blooming
They are 20% blooming now
We Japanese loves sakura
I also look forward to it
I am getting bored with this cold winter
I don't like spring very much only from this point of view
After the rain, it became much cooler
Fall is finally right here in Japan
We had wished fall would come soon during that very hot summer
We welcome this fall very much
Do you have any plan to enjoy this fall
My wife and son will go for a sightseeing to Nara today
I hope they can have much fun on this trip
I am wondering if I buy a pair of boots
I love it, but my feet felt the boots a little small and tight
I want bigger one
Because of the strong yen these days, I can take advantage of direct importing
Even with the shipping cost, I can get one at a lower cost from US by importing directly than in Japan
I am planing to buy a new pair of boots at the eBay shop
Siverling and almost no sweat
Maybe yes
I send an email and received the reply
I send the email to the Singapore Economic Development Board Tokyo Office
And I received the reply for it yesterday
It said we can visit the Tokyo Office and talk about the visit some institutes in Singapore
It is getting clear to visit Singapore
I feel happy for it
Losing weight
My weight was 65.4 kilograms after dinner yesterday
I think I am losing weight at a good rate
My goal is 63 kilos
By running more and dieting, I will lose weight
I think it is important to take it easy and not to rush for it
My son will take the entrance examination for the university of his first choice tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
He is not very nervous now
He looks excited positively
He has been enjoying studying kinds of subjects at his own pace
I am glad that
Am I more nervous than he
It was a half-marathon held at very hilly course nearby Mt
At the 1st half, approximately 10km straight uphills, and at the 2nd half, the 10km straight downhills knocked me out
My both legs and whole body screamed
I forced myself not to stop or walk on the way, and to keep my mind strong
I hang in there
I could get the tough race done
Anyway, I felt good for the nice weather and the nice tough course and my nice spirit
After long-awaited rain
After long-awaited rain, which was not heavy, I feel it getting more humid and colder
Spring has come on calendar in Japan, but it is still cold everyday
On the other hand, from the middle of Feb
to the middle of Mar
some snow fall here in Kanagawa and Tokyo area every year
We don't have any snow throughout winter, but we do have at the beginning of spring
I picked up some disused articles around my desk and got rid of the unwanted things
I decide to throw out some magazines, books, CDs, clothes and something like that
Some of the are going to be brought to a recycle shop
I wonder if I list some of them on the online auction
I wonder if someone want my garbage things
I left significant documents and notebooks for reference of today's job in my office
I was in a hurry at office last night because the lock-out time was very closed to me
I had to bring them back home to take them another office today
I felt like I was not standing straight on foot
I was not a dizzy, but just a strange feeling as if I got drunk or after a sleepless night
I am sure I got some summer fatigue or something like that
I think I must take care of myself and must take some good rests
To drink enough water and take salt not to get a heat stroke
Anyway, this summer will go soon
It will not be longer until it will be cooler
This is a few weeks of patience
I will relax myself during this weekend
After the long over time last nidnight
I ran back home from work around midnight yesterday, no it was already today
After long over time, I enjoyed the refresh run in the silent and dark midnight
I worked until so late to make a resume for a meeting this early morning with the president, co-president of my lab, the president and the co-president of another lab
I completed to make the resume at about twenty to midnight
But I had some snack in the afternoon, so I didn't feel hungry very much
Well, It is time to go to the meeting
I have not to make any yawns there
I will probably have no time to make a yawn
Mountains look burning
Mountains turn yellow with a lot of cedar pollen as if they were burning like a mountain fire
They are flying into the air and will attack us
The medicine for allergies makes me oversleep
They are so close
They get along very well
Which phrase is adequate
At the dinner on the night before his entrance examination, she gave him a piece of her pork cutlets
She like cutlets, so we asked her \"Are you full enough?\" She smiled and said \"This is the \"CUTLET\", eh
She wish his success in his exam, so she gave it to him
The sound of \"cutlet\" and \"Katsu\" which means \"win\" are similar, so the Japanese poor joke, \"Ton-katsu tabete uma-katta\", is very popular
That really means \"I ate pork cutlets
It was delicious.\", but also jokingly means \"A horse ate pork cutlets and won.\" \"Uma\" means horse
What nice brother and sister they are
I am happy because of my very nice and close family full of family love
I received a divers' watch won at eBay auction last evening
It is middle sized automatic one made about 20 years ago
I loved it at the first sight
It is heavier than usual quarts watches, because it is an automatic mechanical  type for heavy duty use
It doesn't need any batteries for running
It is like a Eco type, isn't it
My kids was back from their short trip
This was a story some days ago, my two children, a son and a daughter,  went on a short trip to Fukuoka in their spring holidays
They went to Haneda Airport by train and to Hakata International Airport in Fukuoka by air alone by themselves
My brother lives in Fukuoka with his family
There are two of my two nephews
The nephews also loved to meet and play with them
My children loved the castle very much and sent me its photo via email of the cell phone
But, of course, the lie must not be like something hurting other people, it must be for making them and yourself happy or fun
I think it is for us getting more smile by enjoying funny lies like jokes and enjoying our life ourselves
It is not good to tell lies everyday, so only on one day a year, April 1st, we can tell a happy lie
It seems not easy for me to tell a happy lie
I wonder I don't have a sense of humor
What funny or happy lies have you told ever before on the April Fool
In the summer, we have a lot of fireworks festivals in Japan
We Japanese love to go out for watching them in Yukatas, which are the traditional summer clothes of Japan
Yukatas are one kind of Kimonos
Women and girls go out with wearing Yukata in summer, nowadays, for example, to go summer festivals or something like that
Men and boys rarely go out in Yukata
Where we men wear the Yuaktas mostly are probably at Japanese style inns, after taking hot spring
So we can luckily enjoy watching just outside our house, we don't need to take trains or something
The only thing we are sorry about is we can't enjoy Yukatas, because neighbors and we don't wear Yukatas around our houses to watch fireworks
If you communicate with someone, you share and exchange informations with them
The mutual communication is much better than the one-way communication, I think
Mutual communications would bring us many worth things such as mutual understanding, happy feelings, smile, love, new ideas, and something better like that than one-way communication do
If you want to make a mutual communication with someone, you can start by saying hello with warm smile to them at first
At this site lang8, to write a entry, make a correction or leave a comment on it, and reply to the comment or leave back another correction on their entries is a kind of great mutual communication
I did not reply to all of your corrections and comments at lang8
I always appreciate that
Thee cold days and four warm ones
These days, a cold day follows a warm one and another warm one follows the cold one
We have a four-kanji-character-compound \"三寒四温（さんかんしおん）\", which means three cold days and four warm days
When Spring coming, It gets warmer with the cycle of three cold days followed by four warm days
Especially in this Spring, the cycle seems me to consist of a single cold day and a single warm one
I wonder what clothes to wear everyday
Even if I fall asleep, I wake up one or two hours after
My sleep seems like very shallow
Of course, I feel sleepy in daytime, especially after lunch
Do you have any good idea
2010's first working day
Today January the 5th is the first working day in 2010 of my company
I hope I would be able to do many good jobs this year
Regardless of the recent depression, no, for the reason of the depression, we should work harder and harder to make the economic recovery
OK, It's just a time to make ready for going for my job
Good luck for everyone
Are there some troubles in lang-8
I could not log in lang-8 this morning
Are there some troubles in lang-8
I got able to log in about 5 pm
Many friends of mine make kind corrections and comments on my journals every day
I can come back here luckily and hope this service will be available for a long time
I fixed by only rebooting the ADSL modem, the rooter and PCs
I am the only one in my family who can fix the trouble like that
I wonder I have to teach my family how to reboot them
We have a marathon race today
Many participants take part in it
I am one of the voluntary organizer of it
We had prepared for it for several months
We made setting the race site and course all day long yesterday
I am in charged with the race site as one of the chief staffs today
I hope we will able to organize it well and also help the participants enjoying the race very much
I signed up the Facebook, which is a SNS
However I didn't use it very much because I didn't have friends using the service
It is getting popular now in Japan due to the movie about a SNS
Several old friends of mine signed up the Facebook recently and found me, and sent me messages
A very long time passed since the last time we met actually
I think the progress of the information communication technology is amazing
My wife and I are enjoying the pot gardening
The tomatoes are species of small fruits and the bell peppers are of red and yellow fruits
In this summer, we have harvested many tomato fruits from the tomato plants
Tomato plants had grown surprisingly fast and fruited a lot of tomatoes
They are very fresh, concentrated and delicious
We enjoyed them at breakfasts almost everyday
They are also very fresh, thick and surely delicious
There was a news yesterday
We have been  studying about some Research and Development strategies since last spring
I was surprised to have found that one of the members was alumni of my high school
He was my 4 years senior alumni
I found it yesterday
It is very rare to meet my alumni here in Kanagawa, or Tokyo, which are in Kanto area, because my high school is in Hiroshima
I worked till late around midnight last night
And unfortunately, it started raining since late evening
So I had to run back home on the short route straight in the rain with umbrella around midnight
But it is not easy to run with umbrella
She wanted to do some exercises because she finished her regular exam of her high school
We went into the night neighbor for jogging
We enjoyed very much
Cool and pleasant breeze felt very good
It was one by my son
He missed the station the nearest our home of the last train because he fell to sleep in the train
He sometimes does so
His midnight call from the end of the line wakes me up and I drive a car to pick him up there
Well, it takes only 15 minutes to go to the terminal station
That was a little too much, even for me
Do you know of LSD
I ran the day before yesterday for about 4 and half hours
I don't think I ran at enough slow pace for LSD
It should be called LD without \"S
Anyway I ran
That was including the practice run of the ekiden relay race on next Sunday, my part will be a 4.8km downhill,  and visiting the temple at somewhat deep in the mountain to thank for the good results of the entrance exams of our son and daughter, on the way of the so called LSD
I have planned not to get tired too much for the 10k race next day and I planned to ran at easy pace
But I underestimated the inclines of going up and down the hills
I felt exhausted
We have soccer games today
We come together to play soccer only once a year for this activity
But we enjoy playing soccer with each other because we had graduated from same high school and had played at same play ground long time ago
I am looking forward to this event for a long time very much
I am worried about the weather, but it seems like we don't have rain today, at least before noon
It was a rather new holiday, which established in 1996
It is celebrating on the third Monday in July
This is a party of the alumni graduated from the high school in Hiroshima, held in Tokyo
It is not very near from Hiroshima to Tokyo, but many alumni are living in Tokyo metropolitan area
We have twice of the alumni party a year, which held in spring and fall annually
I am looking forward to going attend the party
But I have a work
I have to leave office early to go there
I wonder if I can, but I want to leave office early before the finish time today
There was an entrance ceremony of our son's university yesterday
It was raining and too much cold for April unfortunately
He looked like being proud
I have two troubles regarding to the internet shopping now
These are the delivery errors or something like that, I suppose
First, the replacement of a fault watch which is bought in the eBay haven't come to me yet
The replacement seems to have got lost somewhere on the globe
I contacted the seller but
And second, coffee, which is ordered to an internet coffee shop I used constantly, seems to have got lost too
What happened around me on earth
I hope them delivered soon
My shoes shrink or my feet grow
My shoes became tighter or my feet may have swelled up
My toe nails turned black and I had some blisters on the toe and the soles
I suddenly came up with an idea yesterday
That was a simple way as follows
I removed the insoles from my Mizunos to make it loosen
Don't you think it is a good idea
This was the first run without insoles
Without insoles, the shoes felt harder but not so much
My toe had some room in the shoes and felt more comfortable and less pain
Mmm, I want a new pair of shoes of bigger size
We were very glad to see his play and to hear his name on TV
His team lost after the extra time of the game unluckily, but they played very exciting game
I got a new PR on yesterday's marathon
About 4 minutes less than my old one
We could run on a very nice course and in a very good weather condition
It is written using \"kanji\", \"hiragana
I will take an endoscope examination today
So I called it a day early yesterday because I have to have dinner before 9 pm for taking the exam
I don't like an endoscope checkup
The endoscope comes into my stomach through the nose
It is even better than through the mouse
But it is still very uncomfortable for us
I picked up the phrase as \"To know is one thing, and to teach is quite another thing.\" I definitely agree that
I should know Japanese very well because I am a native Japanese
I sometimes find it very difficult to correct Japanese on lang-8er's entrries
They are learning Japanese at each levels
My friends always correct my English very well
Fulfilled week
I was fulfilled this week
First, I was busy on my job, where I have a lot of tasks to do
For example, I had some meetings with someone at first time, made a presentation to new employees concerning our section, made some important decisions regarding our research
It was because I have the TOEIC test this evening
Furthermore, I am a member of organizer for the marathon event on this weekend
We have something to prepare for it
It seems for me that time had been running faster than usual
This fulfilled week really flew by
Niigata is located on the Sea of Japan side of islands
I saw a piled snow there
It seems hard to spend here in winter with such a lot of snow
It had been not snowing in Niigata, but it snowed a lot in Tokyo yesterday evening, the super express to home was delayed by the snow
We rarely have much snow in the Tokyo area, so we are not used to much snow
Therefore such snow make somewhat effects on our life, such as the train delays, for example
The entry phone of our house rang, but no one was at the entry
We had two time of this in this week
Were they ding dong ditch
Otherwise some occult things
In the Summer time, we say we may have some spiritual things
They must not be occult or spiritual things
I believe the entry phone rang accidentally by some kinds of electromagnetic noises
Hoping world peace
On the day in 1945, one of the most historically disasters happened
Even today, some people have been still suffering from the serious aftereffects
The house which I lived in and my parents have been living in were also exposed and still leanes a little due to the blast
I hope the world peace
Let's pray for the world peace
We must do what we could do for it
And happy new year 
a little bit faster 
Have you ever heard the word \"Syu-Ha-Ri
At the beginning of studying something, we need to keep the teaching of seniors
At the next step, we break the principle and make some applications on them
It is good to learn
Next, we separate from the teaching and make your own way on the things
I keep it in my mind, and I intend to do it
The wireless LAN in my house seemed to have some troubles
I checked the preferences and the connection setups, but I couldn't fix it
I bought a new wireless receiver and set it to my PC, but the wireless LAN was still unstable, so I bought even a new wireless LAN router to set it
It became very comfortable again
I ran a race today
In the showering rain, but it was not very cold, so I enjoyed running on the wet road
Sometimes I stepped into pods, my shoes got soaked and heavier
Anyway, the rain race run was very fun
We walked through an old abandoned tunnel, where we didn't know exactly
In the tunnel, we felt something was standing behind us, but we could not turn around with fears
I think it was some spiritual thing
Cleaning up our house
Yesterday, my wife and I cleaned up our house
It is a yearly year-end cleaning, as to say \"年末大掃除
Cleaned up rooms,  removed dusts, wiped windows, vacuum cleaned,  threw some unneeded goods and books, washed  screen doors, and so on, thoroughly
No, not so thoroughly, but a little harder than usual
It was not so cold that we had fun cleaning and exhausted a little
Thanks for get-well messages
I don't have any word to say thank you
I think I can run right now, but it's raining outdoors, unfortunatelly
I don't want to run in the rain while only just recovered from the sickness
I sometimes poured water over my head to cool my body
I was fatigued but enjoyed very much
I ate too much during this winter
I gained some weight before I realized it
I ran that much, but I ate more than my body needed for running
I should have to check my weight every day
I have to lose about 3 kilograms by diet
It's crazy hot these days, even fall began on the calendar
We had better to take care not to get dehydrated and heat shocked
The air conditioner of my bedroom was out of order unfortunately, it blows only hot wind
It is 15 years old, so I ordered new one
New one will come next week
We have the X'mas party of our office tomorrow
It is held on every year-end
We have a R&D conference before the party
We will make discussions about our R&D themes with others using posters afternoon
I ran two races in a raw, a 10km race on Saturday and a 1\/2 marathon on Sunday 
This is one of the series of monthly marathons held on every second Saturday
It is because I have a half marathon next day
It is named after Sontoku Ninomiya who is one of the greatest historic people about 300 years ago contributing to agricultural revolutions in Japan
It was beautiful sunny day, So I felt great while running
But my competitive personality didn't let me keep running slowly after another runners
Less smile but serious look on my face
maybe
This was my equal private record at this marathon
I was totally exhausted by these two races for two consecutive days
I had a meeting with the director of laboratory, who is my big boss,  alone yesterday
The meeting was held before the starting of the business day
It was because he had no time during all day except that time
That was the first time we discuss alone without my immediate boss, so I was somehow nervous before the meeting
We could have very fruitful discussion about my project
I will introduce you my room where I am now studying
It is 3.5m width and 2.6m depth and has 6 tatamis as a floor
There is a low table at a corner, originally for using as the center table at a Japanese style living room, which I use for my studying desk
There are a pile of books stacking on it
There is my space
But there is not my own, not only for me
There is shared among my family, of course
Sometimes my son used my laptop there to study for his entrance exam
He will surely use his own and not use my one hereafter
His younger sister will sometimes use mine from now on for her studying
Well, anyway, I and my family use the corner of the Japanese style room for studying
I think to call it quits this time
Last episode of the TV drama
I watched the last episode of the TV drama, following the second last
I would like to say it was very fun, but unfortunately, as always, it was not as fun as expected
I think it is very difficult to make a story very interesting throughout the beginning to the end
If it is very interesting, we expect it will be interesting till the end
The more we expect, the bigger the gap between the expectation and the reality will be
Anyway, I enjoyed the drama very much
If I scratch more, I feel itchier
It seemed that I was bite by mosquitoes here and there on the body
Arms, legs, back, and so on
They feel very itchy
Even if it feels itchy, we should not scratch the spots where mosquitoes bit
They get itchier and itchier if we scratch there
Mosquitoes are increasing from now towards the late summer
It was not badly hot these days for about a week
Has the hot summer already gone away from here
It looks like good for us to reduce the electricity consumption
There may be no good influences on some leisure industries as well
to where
It was freezing cold this morning under a cold wave
The paved road surface felt harder under my shoes than usual
My hands were so chilled that I could not write nor type well
Morning glow was very beautiful because of clear air
We are now developing the new products and new enterprises from our company
We get some good experimental data and not very good data everyday
We also get some market informations from the marketing section
We do have good days with a lot of progresses and also not very good days without progresses, with some troubles instead
Anyway, we are progressing step by step, day by day, and will achieve the goal to produce new products to the market
The weather forecast said the rainy season was ended in Japan yesterday.  It is just a mid summer now
It is very shiny sunny and dizzily hot today
Please take care not to get dehydrated or not to suffer heat stroke
You had better not to exposed the sun shine and heat for very long time
Enough water and electrolytes help you from heat attack
Take good care and enjoy summer as well as possible
A big earthquake. Are you OK? 
A big earthquake stroke Japan
It was a biggest in this 150 years in Japan
And the 5th biggest in the world
10 meter height tsunami attacked the shore near the ground zero
My family and I are OK fortunately
I came back home around midnight after a long overtime last night
We ran a mara-nic, which means a MARAthon distance picNIC, yesterday
We started from Odawara , climbed Hakone, and headed to Mishima
It was very hot at the sea level, but somewhat cooler and comfortable at the high elevation level
We enjoyed this crazy tough running
There seemed something trouble with lang-8 site
Perhaps, a lot of users visit all at once, so the system might hang up
Or some maintenances are now being made
Do you know any ideas for this
In Japan, there is a word \"nomi-nication
That is a coined word made by adding \"nomi\" to \"communication
we should make more communication with others with help of some alcohol
In these days they say that we Japanese make less communications with others, especially with colleagues or business partners, than used to before
I used to go for a drink with my colleagues, often with my boss, every weekend about ten years ago
But recently, we don't
We go with close friends, but merely with colleagues or bosses
The less communications make the worse human relationship
Even the boss's frowny face may seem cute,  charming, handsome, or something like that,  as you know him more
So, I am planning a small dinner party with my working group by the end of January
It was the coldest in this winter, yesterday
And the weather forecast says it will be colder today than yesterday
The road is somewhere frozen and icy, and so slippery especially in the morning
We should take care not to slip to fall down
I wish spring is coming soon
I have just got though out from three year days of my \"Yakudoshi
The measurement way is called \"Kazoe-toshi
This time my Yakudoshi is the age of 41 to 43, form Mae-yaku to Ato-yaku
It finished the day before yesterday, my 43rd birthday
I did't experience any misfortunes or illness during my Yaku-doshi years
This is a Japanese belief that people at the ages of yakudoshi are likely to experience misfortunes or illness
Second, as a husband, I was not very good husband
I love you
Next, as a runner, I enjoyed running
I ran for more than 2000 miles of total distance this year
I should have done more exercises with balls
As a engineer, I was as usually I am
It was an ordinary year as usual
We have something good and something not good this year
Anyway, we laughed and smiled happily very many times
I have a summer vacation for a week from tomorrow
Unfortunately my wife will not have days off next week, so we can't go on a trip to somewhere very far away
We are planning to go for a day trip near here by taking the Hakone mountain railroad
We will enjoy taking the train of the switch-back style and seeing the beautiful sceneries
In the rest days, I will enjoy taking a rest while doing something for myself, for example, reading books, cleaning rooms, gardening, jogging, etc
Maybe my summer vacation will fly
Well, I wonder what I will do during it
We had a welcome party for me yesterday night
I had moved to another department in my office on April 16th
My new coworkers held the party for welcoming me
Younger coworkers are in the new department, so more cheerful the party was than my old department
Many delicious meals we had
There was a unique meal there
That is deep fried gingers
Have you ever eaten them
I ate them for the first time
It was delicious more than expected
We had a couple of very happy times at the bar while chatting casually since we had known each other with most of my new coworkers for some time
I was very happy to be welcomed and felt grateful for them
Rainy race
I have a half marathon race today
I will go near Mt
Fuji to run the race
It is raining right now here
I don't know if it will rain at race place
Well, however, I will be used to the new one soon
The highest temperature of the day is around 35 degree Celsius everyday
It is dizzylingly hot
In the city, there are the heat island phenomena
The heat wind is breezing instead of the cozy cool wind
Have you ever felt your losing of motivation after a big goal
It is weird that I don't think I can keep my motivation high after my big goal which is the completion of my first ultra marathon achieved on two weeks ago
I don't want to run after that as well as before
Perhaps I might have got a burn-out syndrome or something like that
Have you ever felt yourself like this
I have read a like story on a book by Haruki Murakami
Probably it maybe partly because of the physical fatigue, including the visceral fatigue
The instinct might force me taking a rest for recovering my whole body
Anyway, It is a very interesting experience
I enjoy it
I will take a good rest for recovering my body for some time in order to enjoy myself running again
There is just a month left till the end of this year
Time does fly actually
But they are not troubles but planned for saving electricity
We Japanese and Japan will recover soon
We spend almost normal life except for the disastrous area and blackouts and suspension of trains in the northern half of Japan
We are proud of our behaviors even in such a serious condition
We still stay strong so far and keep it up
We appreciate very much that you send Japan your support, charity, and pray
We don't have enough word to thank you
So we enjoyed the reunion party by remembering and talking about good memories in those happy days
We all got older, but our friendship will have been always green and never fade away
We had a work last Saturday, so we have a rest day today for its substitution
To tell the truth, some of the power cuts were cancelled by saving electricity consumption
I think we will have them at least in spring and summer
We have the irregular and stressful life cycle for a while to make Japan recover quickly
What we can do right now by each of ourselves is what we have to do right now for immediate recovering
Our company's president recently showed new globalization plan for employees
It was said that we should make us more global
We must study foreign languages, especially English, and get a business mind of the world competition level
It was showed that we must take the TOEIC test and score more than 600 for promotion
April's Fool
Yesterday was April's Fool Day
Anyway, I still live honest
Mentioned above is not a lie, I am sure
It is a running event of 42.195km long and easy run to see some scenery
I have one today, but it is now raining now, unfortunately
Take extra care for the road safety
On the way home I was nearly run over by a car yesterday evening
I run to work and run back home from work almost everyday
In yesterday evening, at a T-junction with a good view, not blind, I was running down straight along the road at an easy pace, A car approaching to the junction from left path ran though a stop sign at the junction intersection and nearly ran over me
I glared angrily at the female driver and went away to keep jogging as if nothing had happened
She could not see me running because she was in a hurry to go back home for preparation of dinner or something, I don't know
At dusk, we can not see very well in getting darker outside
So we must take extra care when driving, walking and running outside to keep ourselves from being in traffic accidents
I go to work by train on rainy days
It take more time than run to work on sunny days
I take two trains to my office, so I have to lose some time to change train
While running to work, I listen to music with my iPod, on the other hand, while taking trains, I read some books
I will go for it
I came back home late at night again yesterday
I have a lot of problems to solve at work which happend in line, one after another
It is sure to be a good chance to grow me up, it must be, I believe
Well I will charge myself up to get them done well
The team is belonging to a Kanagawa prefecture amateur senior soccer league
At the senior league, only the senior players of over 40 years old can play
At the annual meeting, we discussed the activities, including the game results and the budget in the last year and made the plan for the coming year, while talking about old and new staffs, way of managements, game tactics and so on
The meeting was held at a party room in an Izakaya for about an hour without drinking, it was surprising for us
It was very worthy meeting
And thereafter, we slipped into a party with alcohol
It was very fun
We drank very much and enjoyed talking about our soccer and also about something else
I wonder why athletes drink much
At least many athletes who I know of
I love electric fans in summer season very much
I don't like cool and cold air from air conditioners very much
Electric fans blow us nice breeze with more natural air
Electric fans are more comfortable than air conditioners for me
Of course I turn on one by my side right now
It is cloudy and is about to start raining
It's a rainy season in Japan
Electric fans do great job and play great roles in this season and coming summer
However, the rainy season here in Kanagawa, Japan will be end in a few days
I think it will be the next week
I love summer of course, but in this summer I am worrying about the electricity saving
Less light is rather good, but less air conditioner is not good especially for weak people, for example, the old, the baby and the sick
It's said that good fortune will be gone if you speak
I spent watching some dramas and movies recorded on the HDD recorder
I watched \"500 days of summer\" and \"Solanine\" which is one of Japanese movies, and so on
Besides, I had my hair cut after about two months from the last cut
I did not do any housework and did refresh myself by thoroughly lazy resting
I could probably completely refreshed myself now
In these days, I have been repairing the lawn in the garden
It was a kind of cooler climate lawn for autumn and winter season
I have been repairing with another kind of hotter climate lawn for summer season
It grows very faster in this hot summer
I tell you how I repair the lawn
Well, now I get it started
First, cut the straws from the summer kind lawn grass for about 5cm, and second, put them in holes picked in the garden
And then, water the straws every afternoon
Several days later, almost all the picked straw will root and grow
No need to pay more money
Why don't you try
It is a kind of fire festivals to worship traveler's guardian deities which called as 'Doso-jin
It is held here and there in rural area in Japan on the little New Year (January 15th or during14th and 16th by the lunar calendar
We burn the ”Kadomatsu”, that is decorative pine branches, \"Shimekazari\", that is sacred Shinto rope with festoons, \"Kakizome\", that is calligraphies for the New Year, and so on, at the central fire
It is said that we can avoid getting diseases if we eat rice cakes which baked in the fire, and we can improve calligraphy skill if the fire rise high
Three days off in a row
Tomorrow is the national holiday that is Coming of Age Day in Japan
So we have three days off in a row
I am enjoying the rest days just after the beginning of the new year
I can't wait it
Difficulty of timely corrections on journals
I think it is difficult to make corrections on others' journals timely
I want to make corrections and comments on journals to help studying languages to each other and to make friends with each other
Whenever I want to do so, someone have already made corrections on them
I don't think it is good to write same corrections as former's, so I am sorry but I can not make corrections adding to them
It's likely a kind of competition
It is surely difficult to make an original correction on someone's journal very timely
Have you ever feel these difficulties like me
That is based on the novel originally written by Kanae Minato
It's a revenge story of one junior high school teacher whose daughter was killed his pupils
The story mainly consists of the confessions of some characters
She, who is a teacher, a mother and became a revenger, revenges on the killers for her daughter in the very psychologically terrible way
It was a horrible story, not a happy story
No one could become happy, even the revenger mother and the revenged killers
One killer, who is a junior high school student, has his own story why he killed a little girl
And the other killer, who is a classmate of him, has another story
I don't recommend the movie to all people, especially to parents who have school kids
But It would make you think if the school life of your kids may be okay
It was only a non fiction story, but was psychologically horrible enough
I hope like this story will not happen in real world
Anyway, nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie
How do you like movies of this kind
It was an excellent weather for running marathon
Fuji which is now capped with snow, and the other mountains colored various colors of fall leaves
The 1st half of this race, I ran fun but too fast
This caused the speed down of the 2nd half
I got a stomach muscle spasm around 25km
It was a little serious for running
The toughest one in a year, I think it was
What are you planning to do in this weekend
I will run a half marathon in the Fuji International Speedway on Sunday
I will run 4 and half laps at the entire course on the speedway
But much slower than a racing car needless to say
Congrats Spain
Spain beated Netherlands 1-0 in extra time
It was very exciting game filled with many amazing plays of global level
I am looking for the next one even the current one has only just finished
I make it a rule to do some routines in the new year's holidays
On the first day, I run to the top of a mountain nearby to see the first sunrise with friends
Then, I walk up to the temple to wish a nice year with family
On the second day, we visit my wife's parents for New Year's greeting
And we go to cheer the Hakone Ekiden Relay Race
And we go to watch the High School Soccer Championship games at the stadium
And then, we go shopping at Yokohama midtown
On the third day, I run to cheer the Hakone Race again alone
I spend somewhat busy holidays
Note everything down on notebooks
We always think of many things of various kinds
Coming up with good ideas, having a brainstorm alone, thinking of a right words or phrases, and so on
And, it's a pity that we can not keep all of them in our mind or we can not remember what good ideas we think up a just while ago
We would forget most things because our brains don't have infinite capacities
Yes, probably it is for us, at least for me certainly
Don't you think it is good if we could remember every good ideas we had thought of
What should we do for that
What we should do for that is to note everything down on notebooks
Bringing notebook with us anytime anywhere, we note down anything you see, hear, feel, and good ideas, even not good ideas, everything
Fortunately, notebooks are not so expensive, easy to get at stationary shops, convenience stores, and so on
And they have infinite capacities if we want
When we fill up a notebook, we can just use the next new one
We can write everything on them and then we can forget everything we had note down
That is a good idea, don't you think so
It is not easy to keep high concentration during the long time
Half marathon race
I am going to run in a marathon race today
This is \"Fuji Marathon Festa
There are some races in the \"Festa
I participate with a half marathon race
I will enjoy it 
I'm not ready for going out yet
I have to prepare now
I will report you about the race later
It was nominated for the Oscar
Aliens had come to the earth and their spaceship had been staying in the air above Johannesberg
The aliens was caught and isolated into District 9 by men
Someday, it was planned that they were forcibly moved from District 9 to another district
The chief person in charge of the alien transfer is a man who is not a soldier, but only a minor officer
He began his work to transfer the aliens from District 9 to another district
And then something trouble happened to him
The rest is omitted for not to reveal whole story
I enjoyed seeing it
It was interesting for me
But I don't recommend all of you to go see it
It is not just a happy movie or not for young children because some cruel expressions are in it
It is full of a variety of features; aliens, actions, splatter, robots, friendships, and so on
But unless you like these genres of movies, I don't recommend you to see it
Now open the sweetfish season
They come all the way from a distance early in the morning
The river is famous for sweetfish fishing
They fish by decoy in the center of the river at waist level of water with very long fishing rods
They are lead to invade the turf of some other sweetfish of target and the invaded one attack the decoy to be hooked
That is the way of fishing sweetfish by decoy as well as I know
I have never fished sweetfish by decoy
Many fishers and very long rods in the river is a beautiful scenery in summer
Along the usual riverside course, I did an early morning run before leaving for a business trip
After the rain, the road was getting dry and felt a little humid but comfortable
Today, I will attend the lecture for getting the licence of the fire prevention supervisor
I will be the supervisor
At first, I began running for losing my weight
I think it's for something like a self-development
And I could manage to complete it
I got a sense of completion
I could get a huge sense of completion
But at the same time, it was weird but I felt some sense of lack
From 70s seniors to 19 years old new graduate came there
We all seemed like we had been in high school days
It was Saturday yesterday
Sunday is usually a holiday for my company
But I had  to go to my office to do some urgent job
I decided to run to holiday work
I made some detour along the river and somewhere for about one and a half hour
I ran back home in the midday
One of my daily workout is a strength training
I do this mainly to strengthen my body muscles but also to wake me up in the morning
I don' do this too hard
and use no extra weights as dumbbells
Pushups on th toes for 30 repeats
How do you think about my training menu 
Mine is rather half empty
I think time flies fast
I want more time to do more things I have to do
Have a good time on your 2nd half
The other semi final game of the World Cup soccer is now being played by German and Spain
Now I am writing this post during the half time
Spain team overwhelmed German team in the 1st half
Speedy short passes were made and fantastically organized team play made by Spain team
Well, now the 2nd half was whistled
Do you think the blue sweater of the coach will work for German team again
I found one shooting star this morning
To believe yourself
To believe your capability
To believe you can get though the difficulty
To believe you love people around you
I get up early to study everyday
I always get up at four on the weekdays and at five on the weekend
For being like that early bird, I have to go to bed early at night to have good sleeps
But unfortunately, I have been very busy at my work these days
I come back home from work around eleven in the night
I can sleep only no more than five hours a day these days
This is why I am still very sleepy right now
Well, anyway, I have to prepare for a presentation in the meeting next Tuesday
Whenever at a time like this, some troubles happen to us
We must pull together to go through this difficult situation
OK, all right, I woke up right now
I' ll do my best today
Excursion with my son
My son and I took the same train to commute yesterday morning
I went to the head office of my company in central Tokyo for business meeting
I took the train which my son took to his university
There was no seat for two of us, but only room for one
The train was getting crowded more and more  as it went to central Tokyo
After that, he got off and changed at Shimokitazawa Station to his train to school
I also changed at the next station to my head office
It was only one of daily scenes
They were set in splints not to fall down by the wind or anything
I am looking forward it growing up, getting blooming and fruiting
The zero point was close to the 311's one
Here also quaked about intensity 3
I don't know of the damages caused of it
Now we are in the rainy season in Japan on calendar
However, we had no rain after that
Someone are glad to have less rain, but others are not glad
I am afraid if water shortage may be serious in this summer
Especially we will have to save electricity in this summer
Less electricity, less water, and heat in summer will attack us
The day of the beginning of autumn
Yesterday was the day of the beginning of autumn on calendar
The breeze in the early morning and the evening feels cooler little by little, day by day, even it is still very hot in the midday
We can sleep better in the night than a week ago
I feel a little  sad summer is going
We have a game of the local league
We are sure to be incredible enthusiast of running
It is rather cool in this morning
Do you have any plan
I will go for a two-day trip to Kyoto with my family in the first week on August
I wonder how long it has been since the last our family trip
After two days interval, that was unexpected but good rest, I enjoyed this commute run
We can't expect better weather
But the pollen are now attacking me on my nose
The next, I ran at lunchtime
I was sorry I ran with my itchy and runny nose, but excellent warm spring daytime
I didn't want to go back to office
And the third, I ran a long detour from work
Yesterday was the no overtime day of my office
So I left my office out as soon as possible to run to see cherry blossoms in the dusk
We spend a long time very happily together
I can hardly say directly to her I love her, but I do love her
Some years ago, she completely forgot the day was a day of our anniversary
I love her something like that, too
I found two big male Japanese pheasants at the riverbank path on the way to work yesterday
It seemed about two feet from head to tail
They have beautiful read heads and long tails
There are many kinds of wild birds around the river which bank I run as a home course
Some kinds of herons, geese, and so on, I don't know their names
I am glad to watch them while running
A short of sleep plus some alcohol makes an oversleep, as you know
This was my first time in this year
They are sign of the early summer in Japan
They can live in clean water, so we have not to pollute rivers to preserve them
Anyway, another topics, I got some spam friend invitations these days
Did you
On the next weekend, I will run a 24 hour relay race
The first run to my recently moved office
I commuted by running to and from the new located office yesterday
It was the first run to there
It is a little shorter than ever
It should have been
The former one included a nice riverside cycling road, but the new one consists mainly of streets and sidewalks by them
The streets have a lot of cars during the morning commute time, and the sidewalks are too narrow to enjoy running
I also enjoyed seasonal sceneries on the former riverside cycling road, but I can't enjoy them on the new route
It is not so enjoyable
Especially in the fresh morning
Or I will be used to it
So I should search for better routes asap
I think it will be fun to explore better routes as well
Congrats on advance to the final
Japan players played quickly and toughly throughout the whole game
Their body  shapes are smaller than Sweden players, but they are never inferior in physical properties
And the shots were highly accurate
It seemed there were no place to step in his room before yesterday
He finally made his mind to clean his room
There is almost nothing remained on the floor
Where did they go
There are not so many dust bags
It seem like the messy goods went into the closet, drawers or shelves, probably
I ask myself how was this holiday
And I reply it was very good, of course
I could complete my first 112km ultra marathon, went cycling with my wife, spent much time with my family, read some novels, did some houseworks, and refreshed myself well
The busy days will be back to me
I will fly to Singapore tomorrow for the business trip
Therefore I hear a good news, I am lucky the typhoon will have gone tomorrow
It speeds up faster than forecasted
So The flight for my Singapore trip will be able to fly as usual tomorrow
I hope so
I have a secret that I still have some hangover right now
At last, The replacement watch arrived to me on Feb.1st
I sent a fault watch to replace on last December
It was 3months ago! 
I sent emails of inquiry to him every week, he replied me he had already shipped the replacement on each of his email, but it had not come to me
But, actually, the date of exportation written down on the delivery record sheet is
I forgive him, because the watch is here on my list now
Fuji is now capped with snow as like shown in my profile photo
I feel the winter is here by seeing it
I begin the morning banana diet from yesterday to lose weight
I want to lose about 3kg of weight until the Arakawa Marathon on March 21th
Just be sure to get enough calories in to stay healthy - if you skimp too much, you blast your immune system and leave yourself open to illness
Good foods make you good healthy
Another working late
I came back home from work around past midnight for the last three straight days
I will have to go to work on this weekend
July comes
The first half of this year has gone
The second half started right now
Which do you think, half full or half empty
To Whom it May Concern in Singapore Economic Development Board

We are now learning about open inovation in Europe, US and Asia compared Japan

ZZZZZ Interbusiness Research Institute website is below
Respectfully yours
I got a mail from my friend yesterday
She said her daughter is getting married next March in the mail
It was a very good news and pleased me
I thought it was coincident that the two marriage will take place around us
By the way, my brother doesn't marry my friend's daughter
Suspicious no-goal
That happened yesterday at the game between Germany and England
The ball shot by a attacking player hit the crossbar and bounced into the goal once and bounced back outside to the goal keeper
However, the referee didn't recognize the goal by mistake
Referees of the world level seldom make a mistake, but not never unfortunately
That's why many things are interesting and exciting
At the same card in 1966, that was interesting, German verses England, on the contrary, the referee misjudged the goal for actual no goal
This has been called \"Suspicious goal
The play with no goal at yesterday's game will be called \"Suspicious no-goal\", from now on,  I think
One of my friends is now trying to run 100 marathons on every single day during 100 days
We, his friends, are supporting for his great challenge
We organize marathon races everyday for 100 days
He ran the 85th marathon yesterday
Very exciting plays were seen during the 1st half of the match
These were very speedy and powerful
The splendid goals were shot scored by Netherlands
and Uruguay respectively
Soon the 2nd half is to be kicked off
Remarks of masters of marathon
Please refer to my journal for information of the mara-nic;  
it was tough, but very enjoyable
The members of the Club are running marathons more than 100times
Don't you think it is awesome
They said they are running marathons every weekend
They are masters of marathon, aren't they
Some of the masters said to me yesterday, \"You feel it tough to run marathon if you run once in a while, but you could get used to it if you run do it every week.\" Other master agreed and said, \"Yes, sure
You could get used to it, as well as we all got used to it
Mistook
I got a mail
The mail said the item I sold on internet auctions was not correct
I said it was made by a  maker, but it was made by another maker
I made a mistake
I proposed him to return and refund
I feel some stress these days
I have to refresh myself by doing something
Do you have any good ideas for refreshing
At first, I will enjoy this weekend
Playing badminton in the gym in the hot summer seemed very tough and probably gave the players, including my daughter, some physical and perhaps mental damages, as called a summer fatigue
We are worrying her
We started at the Japan National Stadium, ran about the city of Shinjuku and ran back to the stadium to finish
It was very fun and exciting
Some masquerade runners ran
Pikachu, Gatcaman, which are anime characters, a zebra, a swan, a businessman, a schoolgirl, and so on
They were so fanny
The marathon race was exciting
I had a marathon race yesterday
I had mistook to set an alarm or quit the alarm by mistake unconsciously last night
So I had to rush to the starting site
Without any magic supplements, any nutritions nor warming up and stretching before the start, I started running the race
In the beginning, I ran at even slower pace, and gradually sped up to even easy chattable pace
Comfortable and beautiful Fall day, I felt very good
After around 35km, both sides of outer hips felt sore and body felt heavier
I managed to keep the pace to the last
And in the last about 1km, I escorted a visually impaired runner
It was my first time as a escort runner
We have a trouble with the wireless LAN at our home
We can't print documents with one PC via the wireless LAN on the printer which is connected wirelessly
With another PC or Mac, we can print documents correctly
So only the certain PC has a problem
I am an administrator of the home network, I have to fix the problem
The problem may be at the network setting of the printer or the PC
I am sure to be able to fix it
It was one of the newest smart phones
It has many features like PCs
And the applications can be get through the internet
It is not only a cell phone but a small mobile PC
I am using an old type cell phone
I got back home from the reception for the Challenge Fuji 5 Lakes Ultra Marathon tomorrow
I got my number tags #1570
I will have short sleep and drive there by 3 am
I am too exited to get to sleep
It is held at Shonan area in Kanagawa, Japan
About 20 thousands runners participate it
Done it, too
And third, to run a 100 times distance of 42.195 km during this year
Thank you very much for your encouragements
I am very sorry to complain this time
I am not a kind of complainers
Just this time
By the way, It is about my working environment
I don't like it very much, even say I can't almost put up with it
There are much unpleasant noise and smell from my coworkers
My left neighbor makes loud noise of chewing gums every time
One on my right are constantly murmuring, saying to himself
One on my behind makes loud noise of his broken computer fan that is rotating at the maximum speed all the time
And the one next to the behind wears a lot of perfume
it's not so bad smell but too much enough for me to dislike it
They prevent me from concentrating on my deskwork at my desk
I work on my computer set on my desk, so I can't escape from my desk to another place, for example, to a library or a meeting room
I put earplugs into my ears all the day to concentrate on my work
I wonder what I can do for that working environment
I am making a plan to change it there or escape from there
How are you going in this summer
This is another hot and humid morning here
But it's Sunday
What is your plan for today
There are some representative office of foreign institutes, such as scientific technology research centers
I have chances to visit some of them in this summer
The day before yesterday, we visited to the representation office of that from Finland
And today, we will visit to the office from Germany
We are studying about R&D and business strategies, so we visit to hear about their strategies of the institutes abroad
We could hear very interesting talk the day before yesterday from Finland
We look forward to visiting Germany in Japan today
We can rarely get chances to go such places
They seem something like travel abroad in Japan
10 days already passed since December had started
I was sure to make a lot of things done
For example, The 100 straight day running, the 100km ultramarathon, the 24 hour relay, the transfer at work, the work as a R&D theme leader, and so on
Entrances into the university of my son and into the high school of my daughter
Many many things I had in this year
Well, we Japanese enjoy year-end party
I have several parties
I had one of our department yesterday, and have one with my friends today, and one with other members tomorrow
Well, It is the second half of November
We have only about forty days by the end of this year
What are your top ten news
Yesterday was the Father's Day
Did you call your father if you are living apart from him
Did you say thanks to him
My daughter bought me a chou a la creme with her gratitude
My son showed me his appreciation by saying thanks to me
I also made a phone call to say thank you to my dad
My parents are living in Hiroshima alone
He seems very fine
He said he was glad to be called
I wish his health
I sell some unwanted things on the internet auctions
It seems that they are worthy for the other
Most of them are sold and priced more than expected luckily
I am busy to ship them
I will buy something on the internet auctions with the profits
I will tell you about a small happening around me
We are representative of several companies and  gather to discuss business issues approximately once a month since this spring in this fiscal year
After the meeting, we had a dinner and a had  frank talk for making friends with each other
When one of the member and I talked about our home town, something surprising was made clear
His wife and her sister was the alumnus of my high school and the sister might have been my same year in school
It was surprising happening
We are now 1000km far from our home town
And he and I had met only five times or so
I felt the world might be rather small
In Japan, the lunar eclipse can be observed in the west sky right now
it is eclipsed partially in the lower left part
There is no cloud around the moon luckily, we can see the eclipse very clearly
Happy new year, all
I gonna go out for jogging up to summit of Mt
After the long overnight work
I could have two times of one hour catnaps on the chair
I feel kind of headache or dizzy
What does it mean
We don't have like such words in Japanese
It sounds like a nice word
Can I have the information whether you have any topics about the issue or not in advance of the next meeting
Do you know of the \"White Day
Have you heard it
On Valentine's Day, females give chocolates to males as a symbol of there  love or appreciation
And I think it is weird that turned to be obligation these days
Honmei-choco\" means chocolate of love
Giri-choco\" means obligation chocolates
On the \"White Day\", males who luckily received chocolates return their favor by giving gifts, sweets like cookies, candies, etc
even if he received \"Honmei-choco\" or \"Giri-choco
I'm not sure, but there wasn't the White Day in my childhood
We Japanese love interesting events or ceremonies like this, so the White Day got popular immediately
Me
I have received many chocolates from many females, of course, rrom my wife, daughter, many female friends, coworkers
I have to give them very much delicious sweets with my love
Since Vatentine's Day was on Sunday and due to recent slow economy, females doesn't buy less obligation chocolates
By the way, today March 14th is my 43th birthday
My office moved to the other place recently
It is a little farer from my house than former one
There is a longer distance, it is about 4km, than the former one, it was about 2.6km
I am wondering how to commute everyday
When it is fine, I run to office as before, that's still good
Otherwise when it is not fine, the heavy rain or snow for example, which is better to take a train or to walk to the office
Both of them take almost same time
I must apply for the commute pass, so I must decide how to commute soon
One day business trip
I went for a business trip to Shiga
I took the super express Hikari at Odawara, changed to Nozomi at Nagoya, changed to a normal train at Kyoto, and at last, arrived at Katata in Shiga nearby Biwa Lake, which is the largest lake in Japan
It was rather shorter than expected
I had a business meeting there, at Katata
It's a nice meeting and we had a nice discussion, but for only two hours
After the meeting, I came back by regression on the above mentioned route
It was a long distanced one day business trip
This year October 11th is it
We have many sports festivals and What are you planning on the three day weekend
It will be nice to go outdoors in the comfortable weather in fall
I am going to go running about Tokyo, while stopping at some sightseeing famous spots there on Sunday
But unfortunately, I am sorry the weather forecast says it may rain
The extremely long distance race is very exciting,don't you think so
I have been conducting training for it
At this week I have been tapering down my training for recovering and conditioning of my whole body
I have to remove fatigues from myself
The slower pace and shorter distance run I should do
Of course, if necessary, I have to take a good rest
Well, so, for example, during lunchtime yesterday, I intended to run slowly at easy recovery pace
I ran even more slowly than my usual easy pace for my lunchtime run
I'm really sure I had better to run more slowly for recovery and tapering, but I was so hungry that I automatically pace up to rush into cafeteria
I began to prepare outfits and the other stuffs for it
I am wondering which outfits I should wear
It will be much colder there early in the morning than here in my place, but it will be as warm in the daytime as here, and it will be getting colder in the evening again
It is very exciting anyway
I mowed the lawn and grass, cut some branches of trees
Besides, I went to sell some clothes and books to a recycle shop 
I live around less than 100km apart from it, so I can see it almost everyday
It makes me cheer up everyday every time
But, there was a bad news
Ukyo Katayama, who was former a F1 driver and now an alpinist, and  his party met with an accident during their attack to climb to Mt
Fuji yesterday
Ukyo was rescued and could return alive luckily, but two men of his party hadn't come back yet
They climbed to snowed Mt
Fuji to training for climbing to mountains in the Antarctica
I hope they could come back alive
I am sorry that the camp is not a kind of the interesting outdoor activities
We are studying about the strategies of Japanese companies and public research institutes compared with foreign ones, with some members from some companies
We visited Singapore to study Singapore's two weeks ago
Today and tomorrow we will stay one-stay-two-day at a suburban convention center to discuss our proposal
I am a leader of one work group among three of all
It is like a significant task as well as my own work at my company
I received the sash from my former runner in maybe about 35th position
and I took over about 10 runners, I'm not sure
So we could get the 25th place among over 240 teams
However, unfortunately, It was cloudy yesterday so we couldn't enjoy the beautiful perspectives while running
I was not in very good physical condition from recent busy work day, at least not in peak condition for challenging for my private record
Ttherefore I had decided to run at my fun-run pace
Actually at the race, I ran a bit faster than the fun-run pace, because my physical and also mental condition got better and better while running
This is just the FUN-RUN for refreshing ourselves
Appropriate physical exercise at nice duration and nice load could refresh ourselves, I believe
Anyway, I could enjoy the fun-run race yesterday
I received the results of the annual health check that was taken in June
Spring comes here
Daytime is getting longer and longer, then morning is lighter
I walked on high, narrow bridge without railing in the dream
I don't like high place very much
I feel scared at high place
I had to go through the bridge, but it disappeared suddenly just before I stepped on it
Do you know any ideas
There are some good ideas to think of your posts
What could not you continue instead
I have an overnight work again
I had one on Tuesday, and have another today
It is because we are now conducting a long experiment in my lab, so we take care of it by rotation
Especially, in this heat summer season, it feels much tougher
But, anyway, today is Friday, tomorrow is Saturday
I will have a good rest tomorrow
When I can leave office early, I should do so
Taking a good rest will refresh myself
I came back home late at night again and again yesterday
I have a lot of problems to solve at work which happened in line, one after another everyday
They are newly found technical problems, accidents around personals, disorders of facilities, and any kinds of problems which annoy us to conduct our researches
I am sure this is a good chance to grow me up, it must be, I believe
Well I will charge myself up to get them done well
I hope all of you have good luck on your whole life
We have a welcome and farewell party last night
I enjoyed myself till late
She wants to do practice for the running test in her physical education class next week
Well, yes, women want to be fit at all age, I know
I went on a trip to Kyoto during this summer holidays with my family
I stayed for two days in Kyoto
So I could see many temples and shrines, but it was a little busy
I will go Kyoto in the autumn again more slowly
We are planning to visit Singapore from Sunday on business
But, unfortunately, a typhoon is there on the East China Ocean, where is on the way from Japan to Singapore
On Sunday, it will approach to Japan
Besides, a volcano erupted in Indonesia and is still erupting volcano clay
It is another difficulty for us to go to Singapore
I wonder if our flight can go well
Mine is following
My boy entered the university
My girl entered the high school
I ran on every single 100 days
I could complete my first 100km ultra marathon
I ran more than 4219.5km of the total distance in a year
I joined in the running club
I visited to Singapore
Our office moved to the former place
Other many good stuffs happened around me, not mentioned above
I am making the report to the president of our company about the visit to Singapore
My boss has checked my draft, already for several times
His comment is correct, but I think it will take a very long time to get the report finished
Good news
I have a good news to share
There was the announcement of the result yesterday
He got it
We are very glad to hear the good news
Thank you all lang-8 friends for encouragements to him
And sorry for making you worry for him
I hope he will have nice days at the university
He says he wants to study physics there
He will also learn another various things there
Anyway, It seems to me that children grow up very fast, especially our own children do
I dislike spam mails like that
Fell down to sleep well
It was a tough camp with concentrated discussions all day long till midnight and since early in the morning
I came home around five
I felt tired and free at least at that time
I watched one of recorded TV drama before dinner, read some pages of a novel after dinner, and fell sleep unconsciously
I woke up once and went to bed to have deeper sleep
I got up right now, it is early morning
I live near a station of Odakyu Line Railways
We have the sounds of railroad crossing more than every five minutes
We are completely get used to them
Today December 23th is a Japan's national holiday
Yesterday was the winter solstice, tomorrow is the Christmas eve, and the day after tomorrow is the Christmas
We feel busy in December
We Japanese take a bath with \"Yuzu\", which is a kind of Japanese oranges, on  the winter solstice day
Because we believe the habit keeps us from getting a cold
The day will be longer little by little from yesterday
I hope spring come soon
I took a seminar about leading groups
The thought leads us to do anything well
Positive thought leads us  to succeed, while negative thought leads us to fail
I use the morning time to study
I make a habit to study early in the morning
I continue this habit for more than two years
I'm sure it is because the rhythm of life sometimes shifts by overstays, stresses or something like that
From another point of view, the oversleep may be good for some rest
I will take it a little easier, not strict
Have you ever heard \"Mara-nic
It is made of these two words, \"marathon\" and \"picnic
It means, as you suppose, a picnic of 42.195km marathon distance run
Even slower than normal jog, 7-8min a kilometer or more, I'm not sure
We each take a backpack or a waist bag to carry a bottled water, a camera, a towel, some chocolates, candies, energy gels, and so on, as same as regular picnics
Have you ever heard Enoshima
It is very popular because it is a symbol of Shonan area
There are beautiful sea, beautiful beach, and rows of pine trees
The famous pop group Southern All Stars sings Enoshima and Shonan area, some famous movies were taken there also
Found spring in garden
We have cold days here in these days
The winter seems like to come back
But I can see some signs of the spring coming to our place
The lawn grass woke up and began to grow again
The weeds also began to grow as fast as the lawn grass
The push mower must be ready to work
I was glad to have found the spring signs
Spring is coming here
I am a liaison at our senior soccer club
I send mails to the members about game schedules and game participants and any other informations
I ask their presence or absence some days before every game and let them know the summary
It is more bothering job than expected
So I planned to make the correspondences easy by utilize a mailing list online
Do you know of  a mailing list online
We can email all members at once via the mailing list easily
It seems very useful for me as a liaison
One problem is that it is very difficult for me to persuade senior friends to sign up for the mailing lists
By now, about two thirds of members joined our mailing list yet
I want to and have to let all members join our mailing list as soon as I can
I will introduce some phrases to ease you and me who are suffering from many everyday's stresses
I read them in some books in these days
Don't be egoistic
Don't think you have to be always at the first place
Consider something at your partner's point of view and his values
Answer or response after one breathing
Don't self-defense excessively
Forgive yourself as well as other people
Set you up easily
How do you think they are
Outbid at eBay
I sometimes enjoy the eBay auction
Sometimes I bid on some items, but I rarely win them
It is because my bids are not high , so they are always outbid
So far, I won some old cameras and some old wrist watches at eBay with very reasonable prices respectively
I was lucky then
Browsing at eBay is very interesting, don't you think so
Today, we will have a power cut in the afternoon
We have long holidays called Golden Week in Japan
If added some paid holiday, we have long holidays from today to next next Monday
This is as long as summer holidays or new year's one
What shall I do in this holidays
Some runs, riding bikes, spending with family, and taking rests for relaxing
Have good holidays everyone especially in the northern Japan
I hope it from the bottom of my heart
The import tax of leather shoes is very expensive in Japan
It said that $35 for the item, $40 for the shipping, and $50 for the import tax and something, approximately
Don't you think the import tax is too expensive
The import tax of leather shoes is the higher one between $50 or 30% of the price of item including the shipping
This make me think it is better to buy shoes at $100 in Japan than to buy at the reasonable price like this on eBay
A new week starts
This is Monday
I wonder what should I do until the end of the year
We have something to do in this year, don't we
Cleaning house, writing new year cards, and some houseworks like that
How were you going in this year
My watch seemed broken when it was dropped on the floor
I will repair it by myself if I can do
We are very lucky without any rain yesterday
About 36 thousands runner ran around the central Tokyo
The excellent course, organizing, volunteering and warm cheering
We will run 40 laps on the track in the National Stadium and donate 100 yen every lap for giving safe water
I signed up as a team consisting of four runners of my family :  my wife, my son, my daughter and me
I love running, but I wonder how they do
We had an annual relay race yesterday
It was one of the attractions in our company
The race is held just after the quitting time of our office
But unfortunately, some serious troubles happened over my work in these days
They were all serious and urgent problems
I had to deal with them immediately
It was needed to have done so
I thought I should not waste time by running the race, but should dig in my work
I was disappointed that I couldn't run the race and I let my team withdraw from it
It was a very nice race which has a history
Yesterday's was the 45th
It has a very good course with nice scenery, nice warm audiences and excellent staffs
We fell autumn breeze these days
The hot summer is going
It is still very hot in the daytime, but cooler in the morning and the evening than before
Autumn is coming here soon
Go shopping with my son and wife
My wife and son and I went shopping last Sunday
A shop clerk said us that he envied us for our closeness
Yes, we are very close, I think
We love to go shopping together and enjoyed ourselves sometime
The 18 year old boy goes shopping with his dad and mom
What do you think about it
When I was 18, I lived by myself in Tokyo apart from my parents
That is not why but I rarely go shopping with my parents
I didn't spent much time with them those days
I wish I had done so more
If then, my parents would have probably felt more happy, eh
Anyhow, my family, including my 15 year old daughter, are very close and happy
We have to be nice to parents and family
This \"mara-nic\" is made with marathon and picnic
It was 42.195km distance of picnic
It is mid-summer now, it was very very hot yesterday
We could not run but walk due to the heat
I woke up on the sofa right now
I spent all night on the sofa in the living room instead of on the bed
It is not good habitation
I have to go to bed in the night
I have many things to do before the holidays
I hang on there and will climb Mt
I also have a business trip during the holidays, as same as previous one
He is a 18 year old freshman and she is a 15 year old high school student
I have not seen them arguing or fighting for many years
It is usually my role to help her study at home, but yesterday it was he who did so, substituted me
He taught her math, and on the contrary of that, she helped him practice to teach as a part-time cram school teacher
The Frostbite Road Race was held yesterday in the Yokota Air Base in Kanagawa, Japan
It is the 29th annual race
It is hosted by the Yokota Striders Running Club
We run the races in the base of the US Air Force, on the road around the runways and nearby the residence in it
I run the half marathon race
It was sunny and of mild wind so it was not too cold as last year's
Many American family members in the base cheered us very friendly, while shouting, yelling most in Japanese, \"Ganbare!\", \"Ganbatte!\" I feel happy to hear them cheering us
I could renew my record
It is a little faster than that got there in last year
BTW, what do you say \"Ganbare!\" in English
Good job!\", \"Nice running\", \"Go on!\", ..., they said more but I am sorry I can't remind it any more
It takes not more than 2 hours total to go office
It will be tough, but easier than taking apart from my family
Last week of July
After this week, we will have summer holidays
I am planning what to do on the holidays
I want to climb Mt
Fuji after long while
The last time I climbed was 20 years ago
I will also go to Kyoto with my family
This holidays will be nice
A lot of overtime hours and holiday works is necessary to get my tasks done
I have been working from early morning to around midnight at office and sometimes go business trips
I feel like exhausted and somewhat irritated
I know it is not good for myself and my surroundings
I need some rest for refreshing myself
Ugh, It is time to leave for office to do holiday works on Saturday
Can I ask you to pray for me to keep my mental and physical condition
I do think it's getting difficult for me because of lack of news or essays
They say like this..., 
The slow and steady wins the race
Do it for just only 30 minutes, but do it everyday
If you do it for ten thousands hours in total, you could be an expert of anything
I am facing now a trouble or something concerning about an internet shopping from overseas
I bought a vintage diver watch from an eBay seller in overseas last October
The watch is made around 1980
it is so massive and cool that I love it very much at a first sight
I emailed the seller to replace it or repair it in my English with difficulty
But now, on the beginning of January, I didn't receive the replacement yet
I sent some emails to let me know informations
By the way, I am enjoying this transaction because this is a good chance to study English communication at a special situation
My parents live in Hiroshima where is about 1000 km apart from here, so we can't meet so often
My son will live alone since next summer
I will know my father's feelings when I live apart from my son
My son failed to take the last train after drinking last night and could not come back home
So he is staying in some town right now
Maybe he is staying at a overnight cafe there
It is sure he feels cold
He will be back home by taking the first train soon
I overslept this morning again
It is probably because I am rack of sleep these days
Besides, I love the comfortably warm bed more in cold winter
I came back home around midnight after a long overtime last night
There are many things to do before summer holidays, as you know
Therefore I had better go to bed last night, I knew it, of course, but I didn't want to do so and I woke up late last night
I still feel sleepy now
We measured our height, weight, and body fat rate
We were taken  kinds of test, such as blood test, urine test, chest X-ray, eyesight, hearing ability, ECG, ultrasonic echo, and so on
We must not have eaten and drunk anything, even water, till 9 pm of the day before the check
We got very hungry by its end
I unintentionally welled up tears in my eyes while drinking that sweet coke after the check
New week started
Another new week started
It's been still raining for straight three days
I don't like this rainy season before summer in Japan
It is humid and cold some day and hot the other days
We have to take of ourselves not to catch a cold
By the way, I have to make three reports today
Each one of them is very heavy for me
I am going to make my best efforts for them
Well, anyway, this time, I will introduce you a nice event last night
I ran to work and back home for about 5 kilometers through the residential area and the paddy field and by the river
Ajisai, which is the Japanese name of hydrangea, flowers begin to bloom with colors on the sidewalk
Water is filled in the paddy fields and people were planting rice plants there
It is also a nice scenery
I love it
Furthermore, last night, I found a firefly flying by the river path where I was running
I felt as if it followed me for a while
It was very romantic, wasn't it
It was a rendez-vous or something like that
Ajisai and firefly are symbol of this season
They are only seen in the rainy season in Japan,  and seen only in rural areas
Hurray, how nice living in a rural area
I have a big good news
The results of the drawing for the tickets for Tokyo Marathon 2011 was announced yesterday
It is very lucky that I won the ticket by lot
More than a million people applied for 30000 lucky runners
It is very real platinum ticket
I couldn't win it last year
I am looking forward to running Tokyo Marathon
Why do we easily hurt someone whom we love the most on the earth
We don't want to on purpose, of course, but do hurt by mistake again and again
We feel sorry, unhappy, unpleasant, regretful whenever we hurt them, and we always decide not to do it again
But it is not easy for us not to do it again
 no, why do I myself 
We love Sakura, cherry blossoms
It blooms in Spring for only about one week or so
When blooming, the cherry trees doesn't have their leaves, but only many little flowers with cute white pink five petals
We enjoy seeing sakura, Hanami
The Washington's cherry trees are popular, aren't they
After full blooming, cherry blossom petals will fall in the wind
In a moderate wind, they fly into the air one after one lightly (fleetingly?), I think it is a scene of Japanese Wabi-Sabi
In a strong wind, the many petals falls simultaneously
Thousands or millions of petals fly into the air all together
It is so gorgeous that you would forget to breath
I could not have enough time to post a journal to Lang-8
It was very much hot yesterday
It was record hot in June
Many people were attacked by the heat
We should take care not to get dehydrated in this season
The quake felt like keep shaking for more than minutes
The floor swayed side by side
We felt feared
Its ground zero was northern Shizuoka, where is under Mt
It's very near from here
Fortunately, I had already come home and was with family, and we all were safe
We have to take care of aftershocks
We have a relay race in our factory cite after work tomorrow
It is the 61th annual one
Four runners run at every team for about two to three kilometers respectively
Many people seem to have been looking forward to the race as every year
Anyway, I think that I love running and others also do
I would ask you a favor, I have a question
Would you please tell me how to say to complement someone
My friend said me, \"You are a beast
I am wild as a beast
I think I am sure to be smart and handsome enough not to be said \"beast
I thought I could get higher score than the last one
I believed so
However, unfortunately, the score I got was not as good as had expected
I was disappointed at it a little
It was worse than the last one and before the last
The score got worse at straight two times
I couldn't get score at the listening test
Well, anyway, I was motivated to study hard
I will study hard to get higher score at the next test
It is a relay race where each runner run on the road and kilometers long distances usually
Ekiden relay race is very popular in Japan
University students run relaying from Tokyo to Hakone and run relaying back to Tokyo
Well, going on to my race on Sunday, Six runners in a team will run relaying on each leg
That is a very steep downward slope
I was wondering if my legs could withstand it
My thighs had felt somewhat sore for last race last Sunday and got being better right now
I wish I will be ready by Sunday
Please cheer me and my relay team up
I could not sign up the half marathon
It was already full and closed when I signed up
I will enjoyed the 10km at Shinjuku, which is the center of Tokyo, you know
I join a technology and business committee this fiscal year
It consists of members from various companies like me
We will discuss the environmental technology and its business and so on throughout a year
We will have the first meeting today afternoon
Its magnitude is about M7
Many people were dead and injured in it
Many buildings were collapsed, too
I hope their rehabilitation can be done as well and as soon as possible
There had been a very big earthquake in Kobe, Japan on Jan.17th, 1995
It was today in 15 years ago
It is called \"The Great Hanshin earthquake\" or \"Hanshin-Awaji Dai Shinsai\" in Japan
The magnitude was M7.3
People and buildings in the area had been damaged badly
We should prepare for coming earthquakes especially in Japan which is a country with frequent earthquakes
Rainy season is likely to come here soon in Kanagawa, Japan
There is the front line on the Pacific Ocean near Japan and we had some rain these days
I didn't bring a big umbrella but a small folding one yesterday
I should have bring a big one
I don't like folding umbrellas very much, because they are uncomfortable to bring when they are wet and folded, even if they are portable when they are dry
I don't like to bring a big one, too
I sometimes leave them in the train or anywhere, so I feel nervous whenever I bring one
Summer has already come, has it?  
But the highest temperature of the day here recently is above 20 degrees Celsius
By the way, I am surprised to see that chocolate bars which I keep in my desk for snack are a bit soften and sticky these days
They are not good while being sticky, aren't they
They lose crunchy and crispy taste
They stick to our fingers and then transfer to documents, desk, clothings, or whatever we touch with dirty fingers in summer time
It might be a disaster to stain important documents with chocolates
Or it may make stains on our white shirts
That would probably be a serious matter
That is why I keep coated chocolate balls or something for my snack instead of chocolate bars in summer days
Pay good attention to your chocolates in summer, everyone
Early bird can catch the worms
I get up at 4 o'clock on weekdays and at 6 on weekend
I am studying English with some textbooks and internet sites for studying English like Lang-8
Early in the morning, I think it is better to study, because it is so quiet that I can concentrate to study
How do you think about it 
Sunscreen attacked my eyes
My eyes hurt as posted yesterday
I wondered if that was really a case that a sunburn caused this inflammation as I posted
That's because I was used to spent more time under sun than yesterday without eye trouble like this
Well then, what caused this inflammation of my eyes, I wonder
I put on some sunscreen on my face before getting out
And after getting out, I sweated a lot like a river and got sweat in my eyes
The sunscreen flew into my eyes with this sweat
It hurted my eyes
That's why my eyes became red and inflamed, I guess
The sunscreen attacked my eyes, I'm sure
I rarely put on sunscreen before now
I didn't know how it hurts my eyes
Well, I learned
I am not going to put sunscreen above my eyes
It is still very hot, burningly hot, in daytime, but it gets cooler in the morning and the evening these days day by day
Yesterday evening, on the way home from work, I heard the sound of drums
I'm sure it was of practicing of traditional drums for the fall harvest festivals
Boys and girls play drums and their master plays flute at the local fall harvest festivals
They are very good at playing drums because they have practiced each year since they are small child
We have done for a long long time
I guess there are same or similar customs also in all another countries
How about in your place
There were notifications that my journal got comments or corrections before
However, not in these days
How is yours
We had a milestone meeting yesterday
We reported current situation of our work to decision makers including the president of our laboratory and representative of the enterprise devision
Unfortunately, Our development doesn't go very well
We have to slip our schedule
We got approval for further investigation and our renewal plan
I have sore muscles of all my body now
Both thighs, calves, back, and abdominal muscles feel sore considerably
Especially when stepping down stairs, my both thighs give a scream by pain
Should I take some rest for a while
I agree this
But I think the active rest is more effective than the passive rest with staying still or doing nothing
The tree-planting ceremony was held near my place
It was a very big ceremony there
It was because the Emperor and Empress came to plant trees by themselves
There are many roads had been repaired, re-paved or newly made around and towards the park where the ceremony was held for the ceremony in advance
The Emperor and Empress sowed some seeds and planted by hand some seedlings of trees including pollen-less cedars
It was pity that it rained all the time during the ceremony, but many other attractions were there, that was some dances, reading some essays, etc
We wish the trees will grow up healthily and we will could keep the beautiful mountain and nature
A lot of books pile up on it now
I have thought that I have to clean for months
Most books which sometimes I may read again should be there but it is really true
Books which I haven't read for long time don't have to be there, at the prime location
I will clean up them next weekend
He will graduate from the high school after finishing 3 year study there
He could spend great time there
We are very glad that
The graduation ceremony in Japan is like this
The graduates get some congratulatory speeches, the representative of them give the address in reply, each one of them get diploma from the principal, and then all attendants sing songs
Some day rain and some day shine
Before the summer is coming, it is getting hotter and more humid day by day
For example, I sweat a lot like a water fall while jogging yesterday
We have to take enough water, salt and electrolytes not to get dehydrated even not in mid summer
Besides, we have to get used to the heat and humidity gradually for coming hot summer
We have probably to restrict electricity consumption this summer
We are worried about the short of electricity for air-conditioning in this summer
Well, yes, I will tomorrow
How long does it take for you to commute
How long does it take for you to commute
I run from home to work for about 30min almost everyday
My wife goes to her work by bicycle for approximately 10min
My daughter goes to school by train and bicycle from the nearest station to her school for about 45min in total
My son goes to his university via approximately one and a half hour train trip
One and a half hour to go
Three hours in trains per a day, everyday
I can't say it is not too bad
We are planning to let him live alone in an apartment near his university or in a dormitory in the near future
Regarding the time, if he lives alone, he must do housework by himself
It takes time, but less than 3 hours a day, I hope so
He will learn a lot from experience
For not wasting his time, or not losing kinds of opportunities, we'd better to let him live alone probably
If he remains home, he can concentrate on his study without any houseworks bothering him
It would be better at one point of view
It is a difficult problem for us which would be better, he commutes from home, or he lives alone
Some time is needed to decide which and when we do
Summer Greeting
We Japanese have a custom to send postcards for Summer Greetings
But I think handwriting postcards or letters would be much more appreciated by recipient
I think it is not easy to write letters to someone when we have no news to tell them, but is easier to write Season Greetings
Why don't you send handwriting Summer Greeting Cards to someone sometimes
We have three day holidays this weekend in Japan
I am very sorry I have to go to office for the holiday work
The end of 1st period of the fiscal year is coming soon
Anyway, it's too beautiful for me to run straight to holiday work
I could not help but run some detour before heading to office
So, I enjoyed running in the fresh and clean air before work
Well, It's time to get down to work
We ran from Hiratsuka Sougo Koen Park to Enoshima and back
It was instead of the usual many lap route in the Hiratsuka Sougo Koen Park
The route was flat enough for easy running but somewhat lack of changes, I thought
It was not very hot because of cloudy and sometimes we had a little rain
I ran at an easy not race pace
A lot of fun
We spent for three hours from 7 to 10 pm without any electric lights
It got colder without any stoves
When the electricity came back at 10 pm, we found its preciousness
I found two fireflies flying on the way home from work yesterday
They are at about 5km apart from each other
Bravo, my countryside
I used to go out to see fireflies near our previous apartment before moving here our current place
There was a nice stream for fireflies and we protect them,  so we could see many fireflies there
I'm sure you will love it
Slight change of the life rhythm
Even a small change of life rhythm affects on our physical condition
I think I will get used to this new rhythm
I signed up for the Frostbite Road Race held in the Yokota Air Base on Jan
We can't always enter the base, but at like that event, we can enter there
It is about three months by then
I took a super express Hikari after a while
It was very comfortable, but we had some trouble with using prepaid card at the transition
My prepaid card is not usable for the super express, so I bought a ticket, and used it
After transition to the local train, my prepaid card should be usable for it, but I had an error at the ticket gate
I will go on a business trip from today to tomorrow
We will write a report about our research about the business strategies during this camp
It will be a huge work
We have been studying since last April, the beginning of the fiscal year of 2010, and we will complete and publish this report by the end of FY2010
Our work reaches the final stage
My desk is somewhat messy now
I have to clean to make a room on the desk
I discarded some magazines but it was not enough
More books and magazines should be discarded, but I can't decide which one to be discarded
There were some personnel changes in our office this April which is a beginning of the new fiscal year
I myself moved off to another section on the date of April 16th
I had been in charge of my former work for about six years
It seemed a very long time
My job in the former section was rather something like supporting service
Before that, I had been working at the front line of the research and develoment
I hoped to expand the sphere of my work
I sometimes asked my boss to let me move off back there again or to somewhere else
The new section where I moved to now is in charge of the R&D for producing new products
So I am glad to move off
I have to work harder and catch up with the regarding technologies and markets and so on at first immediately
I wish we can produce new great products and release them onto the market soon
I don't know why, but I always have something like troubles when I buy a watch
This time I bought a digital wristwatch of sport type for the lap time measurement while my running
I received it yesterday, but It was different from my ordered one
That was a bigger and heavier one which is not suitable for my running
The model numbers of my ordered one and of wrong one are very similar to each other
I want to exchange it, so I'll send a mail to the seller
Please make correction on it
I also want to know how to write simpler one and\/or business style one
I am looking forward to it very much
My high school's alumnus will play soccer, whose age are from about 20 to over 70, at a single team
Once or twice a year our club play matches against another senior soccer teams
We can enjoy playing soccer very much nevertheless we could not play smoothly as used to at high school days
Thereafter we go to a party and have a nice time chatting with each other about our recent state
We also help each other in both our public and private life
The special friendship seems because not only we graduated from the same school but we shared the same memories, atmosphere, something like that of our youth days , and so on
I am looking forward to meeting my alumnus and playing soccer with them very much
We need to make our cars to be taken a car safety inspection every two years in Japan
Our cars have to be checked their safety and we have to pay the maintenance fee, expensive tax and insurance
However, we forget to pay tax or something easily
I intend to go to a car maintenance shop for car safety inspection today
As you know well, we have a lot of work around the end of the fiscal year and also at the beginning of the fiscal year
We must review the achievements in the previous fiscal year and plan our target in the new fiscal year
We have to discuss about them with members of our working group
That is why we have busy days in every spring
I usual run to work, but take trains to work on rainy days
We had two-days rain, so I took trains
Since I have to take two trains to work and there are some time loss, it takes more time to go to work by train than on foot
On the other hand, the advance is that I can read books in the train
I could read some classic novels these two days
I still wear a short sleeve T-shirt and shorts while running to and from the office
And a vest on
But I felt a little cold around my arm last night
I wonder if it is time for wearing a long sleeve shirt
Is winter coming here
It was really amazing game
We are really encouraged
The 2nd half of the FSY 2011 started
I transferred to new office from October 1st
I have to move my things to new office and to prepare for commuting to new office
It will be busy this week
Overslept again
I am sure that I don't have enough sleep
Oversleep is just what I need
I wonder whether is better, to take some rest or to keep going to study in the early morning
I made it a habit to get up early and study for some  years
But I know I am in a lack of sleep recently
The best way is, I know, to go to bed early in the night
But it may be better to sleep more for some days rather than to keep going to be an early bird
Another typhoon is coming to Japan
It will arrive today and go over Japan today and tomorrow
I hope there would be no damage
I got up at six thin morning
I have to leave at six thirty
I don't have time for posting a journal
There are iPod shuffle and iPod nano and iPod touch
I got the shuffle several years ago first, I enjoyed listening musics while running and walking
Next, the nano was originally my son's and lent me last year
And I bought the touch this month for myself
Under WiFi circumstance, it acts as same as iPhone
With Skype app, I can make a call to someone
She decided to quit her school club activity after all
She had worried about it for long time
She loves to play badminton, but she got an injury on her leg
She can't continue to keep her motivation as before
Badminton is very competitive sports
It is funner with the competitiveness
She couldn't play as well as she wanted due to her leg injury
She couldn't win the matches as before
She had worried about this and that
Then after all, she decided to withdraw the badminton club
I am sorry but I think it is good decision for herself
Yesterday was the midsummer which has a longest daytime and a shortest nighttime
The sun rises about 4:30 and sets about 19:00 around the summer solstice day
How long that daytime is
However, we are in the rainy season in Japan at midsummer unfortunately, so we can't enjoy the longest daytime very much
Instead of that, around this midsummer, we enjoy watching the World Cup Soccer games held in South Africa on TV 
There is the time difference between here and there, so the games played in the shortest nighttime
Many soccer fans in Japan is now suffering from the lack of sleep by the W-Cup
Of course yes
It is a business trip there
It is my first time to there and it is the first time since the last travel abroad twenty years ago
I didn't remember the procedure to go abroad, for example, how to get a passport, what to bring with me, and so on
At the last time I went to America, I rent a bigger case for the 2-week trip, 20 years ago
This time, I will go for a 3-day 4-stay trip, I bought a carry-on-sized soft carry case
I will go jogging early in the mornings in Singapore for a kind of sightseeing, because I don't have enough time for sightseeing, otherwise
I look forward to doing it
It is about time to have early breakfast and leave home
Please wish my safe trip and successful business
Summer heat is being washed off by this rain and Fall will come here
When someone give us something, we say \"Sumimasen
When someone help us doing something, we also say \"Sumimasen
Sumimasen\" may usually be translated to \"I am sorry.\" or \"Excuse me.\" In these cases \"Sumimasen\" doesn't mean simple apology but means thanks
I don't know why actually it is, but I think we Japanese think it is a virtue to be modest during our long history, we are said to be modest and the modesty might have made us say \"Sumimasen\" to express thanks
When someone correct my poor English, I will possibly say \"Sumimasen\" as well as \"Arigatou
I picked up and asked the members for attending the meetings, and run the discussions there
We discussed some problems of our researches and made consensus what to do and how to do the tasks respectively
The four meetings took about two hours each and total took eight hours
I want to have more time and wish we could do more efficient meeting
The highest temperature hit 39.9 degree Celsius on September 5th in Kyoto
It was the highest in September ever recorded in Japan
However, we feel cooler and comfortable breeze blowing these days in the morning and the evening these days
Fall is coming day by day even if very slowly
We are really hope fall will come soon
Come to think of it, I think I have posted many journals about the temperature in this summer
I will take a TOEIC test on May 18th
I want to score more than the last time
To tell the truth, my score is decreasing at the last two tests
According to the increasing of concern about the globalization, my company recently showed that all employees have to be more global
13 is the birthday of my son
Happy birthday to him
He becomes 18 years old
He is a good, great, awesome son
I think so certainly
At least it is true for us, our family
He is healthy, vigorous, tender, diligent,...,well, I can't say enough about him
Maybe, I may overestimate him because I am his father and I love him very much
Anyway, I am very happy due to him
Of course, needless to say, my wife and his younger sister are happy, too
Our family is very happy
He has been preparing for the entrance exams to universities
of his first choice will be on Feb
There is no time before the exams, but he seems to have been going smoothly with his preparation
I believe that
Took train to Machida, walked around the town, browsed some shops, and finally I bought a pair of shoes
It is what I wanted and looking for
I was lucky to get it at 20% discount price
It was a nice shopping
I wrote we have snow in February or March on yesterday's journal
That came true this year again
it didn't not piled up at all here this time
By the way, today February 11th is a national holiday in Japan which is celebrated as the National Foundation Day
I have no plan for today now
Do you know a relay marathon race
Have you ever participated in that
At the year-end party after the last run in 2009 on Dec.26th, my friends and I chatted to each other with some alcohol about plans of running  in the next year respectively
One of my friends has taken part in some 100km races before, and another has not yet
They are interested in it, but 100km is too long for unexperienced guys, they said
The experienced friend suggested that we all should participate in a relay marathon together in one team
In a relay race, each runner can run appropriate distance and time according to his ability
Some 24h relay marathons were held in Japan
Our two picks among them will be held in July or in September
How long distance can we run for 24hours, do you think
We must do more long distance and long time training without enough sleep for the straight 24h race
We need some more participants, too
How many participants do you think are needed for a 24h relay race
We think 8 is minimum, and 12 is better
Do you think we are weird, run-holic guys
Fruitful Sunday
Such as my hair cut, mow grass, wash cars, jog, and more
I took very much crowded train last evening
I went to Tokyo on business and attend the meeting of a committee discussing how to make innovations
It sounds very difficult, isn't it
Yes, it is very difficult to answer to the problem
We have been holding some of this meetings during one year to make out our own answer for that
Well, after the meeting, I took a subway and a private railway go back home
The evening trains in Tokyo area are always very crowded
My train was fully loaded with people who were going back home from work or from school
I mostly had to stand on one foot for some time
I could not put my another foot on the floor
After more than one and half hour struggling in the train, I could finally sit on the seat
As said yesterday, I will run a marathon in Tokyo
Rain is even good for running if it is not very heavy
Especially, this marathon is not for competition of speed, but for enjoying the famous sightseeing site in Tokyo while we are running slowly
We have more four hours until starting the race and I will leave home in an hour
I hope this rain stop or ease off until the start
There is an earthquake now here in Kanagawa, Japan
It is not so big
The strong wind warning was issued early in this morning
I heard the news in the train to the starting site
I was looking forward this marathon a lot and prepared for it
But, we could do nothing about it
The wind was getting weaker and it almost stopped raining, therefore my friend and I decided to go jogging at the Imperial Palace instead of the cancelled marathon
We jogged 2 laps there,  about 10km,  and then we took a train for about 2hours back home
My body feel sore now because of Saturday's soccer
Some muscles and joints are sore
I regularly run, but my muscles got sore after soccer
The exercise intensity was stronger than usual running
This sore is not very serious, even it feel good for myself
Surely be a busy week
I have a kind of presentation next Tuesday, so I have to prepare for it
It will take much time to prepare the presentation, I guess
And I have to organize some meetings this week
There are three or four, or maybe more
I will make the plan for those meetings and cheer them and then make the proceedings
Furthermore I have parties on Tuesday and Friday evening
It is the first rain in a long while
I think we didn't have rain for more than 2 months
I can't remember the last rain
We have little rain here in Kanagawa prefecture, next to Tokyo
It is good from one point of view, but not very good from another one
Taking good sleep may refresh myself
We used to celebrated the new adults aged 20 on the Coming of Age Day on Jan.15, the little New Year, prior to 2000
They come back to hometown on the day and celebrated
Girls wear Japanese traditional clothings \"Kimono
There is an article of the little New Year but in Japanese
My daughter has a fever since the day before yesterday
She seldom catch a cold and has kept a perfect attendance since the entrance to the elementary school eight years ago
So, she seems to feel sorry for herself very much
Yesterday, she was taken to a doctor and checked if she get a flu
The test result was negative and it said she caught a ordinal cold
We are relieved then
But in the evening, her temperature raised over 38 degrees Celsius again
Many of her classmates are absent from school because of flu yesterday
We are still thinking she have a flue
She is going to be checked again and given appropriate medicines today
I ran into my old friend on the way just before getting home yesterday
It was fancy to see her again there
She said her family had recently moved to our neighborhood
We had lived next to each other in an apartment more than 15 years ago
She has a son of a same age as my son
They used to play together almost everyday when they were toddlers
After my family had moved out, her son and my son played soccer at each teams and played some matches sometimes when they were elementary school boys
After a long interval, not keeping in touch, we happened to meet by accident
We made a promise to meet again with both families and said goodbye
I felt glad to have seen her and heard her family going well
The quarrel between my wife and my daughter seemed finished
A peace came back to my home
I relieved
The yesterday's dinner was Japanese \"nabe\" stew
The forecast says that much more ceder pollen fly this year than usual
It will be about several times of last year
My eyes feel itchy and my nose are runny even with mask
I take some pills for allergy
The work well usual, but their effect may not be strong enough to fight against much pollen this year
Someone will do longer
Headphone was about to die
My headphone for my iPod is something like out of order
Sounds come from only right side, not from left one
I think there is something trouble like a bad contact
It is probably because the plug became a little rusty by my sweat
I want to get a new pair of headphones before the current one is dead
I change headphones about twice a year, I'm not sure
I am now wondering which one I will buy for the replacement
For my jogging use, high graded, expensive one isn't needed
Use up a ballpoint pen
It was a slight event, but I felt happy a bit
I have already set a new refill into the ballpoint pen
It is not expensive one, but costs 100yen
What do you have anything like this slight but happy event
A big earthquake took place in New Zealand yesterday
I wish the damages were not very serious
Are you OK, everyone in New Zealand
Big earthquakes may take place at some interval after the former big one
So we have to be sensitive and careful against the maybe coming next one
But where and how did they come from
As you know, the frogs lay eggs in water and tadpoles grow up in the water
However, my house is located somewhat apart from a water place where frog's eggs and tadpoles grow
Rice fields are some blocks apart from my house where they mostly seem to grow
And for what they come and live in my garden
Anyway they are cute and loved by my family
I posted my previous entry of \"Delivery error?\" ; 
This is a sequel to it
The internet coffee shop sent new one the day before yesterday
Since I had contacted the shop and the home delivery agent and asked to send me the substitution
It is very fast delivery
On the other hand, the eBay seller replied me that he had sent the other replacement watch to me
One of my tooth filling came off when I was eating a candy the day before yesterday
It was lucky I didn't swallow it but I could keep it
I went to the dentist to let it filled in the cavity of my tooth again yesterday
I am happy it took very short time
Do you have any cavities now or already fixed
My first trip abroad on business
I will go to Singapore on business from next Sunday to Wednesday
It is my first trip abroad on business and the second trip abroad after the one to US about 20 years ago
I had to have a new passport issued and buy a carry case and some other stuffs for it
I am excited and nervous about it a little now
I wonder I should have traveled abroad on private, not on business by now
It was like a mid Spring day some day, and like a late Winter day the other day
We are easy to catch cold or to got sick in the weather like that
It is probably because I went to a business trip in the cold rain yesterday and stayed outside without my overcoat which was out to drycleaner's
It was chilly cold yesterday
We had my office X'mas party yesterday
It was very crowded, rather packed like a commute train car, in the cafeteria where the party was held
Many drinks and dishes were served, but more people were there, so I thought they were not much enough, it was short of quantity
Besides, we had some exhibitions on the stage
Some played musical instruments, dance, or the other party exhibitions
They sounded like very fun, but I couldn't watch nor hear them because of the happy and noisy crowd
We spent fun and relaxed hours at the party
That is, I was very lucky to have won the 1st prize of lottery at the party
It was travel coupons
I will go on a one-stay trip with my family to a hot spring not so far
I overslept again this morning
I stayed up late last night to set a new version of ubuntu OS
Some trouble seemed to happen, upgrading to 10.10 was failed
So I had to re-install the ver.10.10 with CD-R
It took a long time to download the disk image and install it on my computer
I wrote something like an excuse, and I think of it as today's journal
Time fly by
And have you ever made good progress of that or finished that until now
And for myself
But I feel time fly by at very fast speed
Don't rush for anything, but take it easy
I went to a barber shop to got my hair cut
It is popular even for men to go to a hair salon in Japan now
But I like to go to the barber shop and go there once every two months near my place
It is very suitable especially for the summer
So did I this time, the day before yesterday, too
I got refreshed
There are four runner per a team, each one will run from about 2.5 to 3.7km respectively
Our team won the 6th prize last year and the 4th before the last
We will try to get better place this year
He has run this relay races many times
We want let him enjoy the one more than ever
Microsoft had announced they will no longer support the Windows 2000 any more
Therefore, for the secure use of them, 2K PCs were at last to get replaced
What I got actually was an older PC than that I was using
It has the Pen4 processor,  only 500mb RAM, and 40gb HDD
It is a reuse PC which had retired from work before
It was poor specs, not enough for my daily work
I can use some newer application softwares on XP
Please let me say excuse for my oversleep
I am tired and lack of sleep
Today is St Valentine's Day
I bought him a new snowboard jacket and pants as the birthday present
My daughter made some cupcakes for the Valentine's Day's presents
Cold days got back these days, nevertheless it is March
In early spring, we have four warm days after three cold days, and then it is getting warmer
This rain will wake plants up for coming spring
I hope this rain wash off the ceder pollen which cause the hay fever
The weather news said this summer was the hottest among the last over 100 years in Japan
It's the spring drizzle, so I'll walk to wet through it...? 
I heard someone on TV said \"It's the spring drizzle, so I will walk to wet through it
Not sure because it is long ago, when a servant put up an umbrella for his master, the master replied the words to the servant
I have a marathon today
I don't like running in the rain very much certainly
That is why I said the words above
Umm, okay, okay, It is just a spring drizzle, I will run to wet through it
I can have a day off work today
Have a good weekend, all
I could not sleep enough this week, suffering from sleepless,  so I could not get up as early as usual
Do you think we can stock sleeping for the next sleepless weekdays
However, too much sleep may makes us rather more sleepy unfortunately, as you know
Anyway, I wish you all have a good weekend
It has been cold these days since last week
it is a little warmer
Cherry blossom Viewing is very popular in Japan
It will get warmer by little and little
Spring will come soon in my place
How about is in your place
I registered for the TOEIC test on May
I have taken the tests for four times before
After a long long interval, the second time was 3 years ago, and after that, I took them approximately once a year
I think it is good for checking my English skill, and also it motivate me well to study English
I should study harder, vocabulary, grammar, listening, business terms, etc
And I have to practice the quick reading and quick answering because there are so many questions and little time
Well, Yes, OK, I'll do my best and gonna get a better score than last time
It is getting hotter
It feels like summer days here in Japan these days
How is your place
My wife and I went cycling with my wife
This is an annual event of us in Golden Week
This is the almost only my long ride in a year
It was cloudy but nice weather condition
There were a lot of people in Kamakura and Enoshima on holiday
I went for a business trip to a convention center near the Tokyo Tower yesterday
Tokyo Tower has antennas for television broadcasts, was modeled after the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which is 333 meters tall and built in 1958
We love to go to aquarium, because we love fish and sea animals as well as we can feel cooler there
What shall I do this year
I will make my family happier at first of all
And then, I will make every others happier
And at the last, I feel myself happy
I will not set myself at the first, but at the last
I found many colorful flowers in the garden on the way to work
They are very pretty
Fall is coming soon even if it is still very hot
I really hope so
We had a strong wind yesterday
I ran against the strong headwind at lunchtime
I couldn't run forward and even about to be blown off
If I had wings, I could glide into the air
Actually, my wife said the laundries were blown off by the wind
The strong southern wind was caused by the winter style of the pressure systems
Full blooming Sakura
I show you some photos of full booming cherry blossoms in my neighborhood
I was sorry it was a bit cloudy, but as shown in these photos, we could enjoy seeing sakura flowers
You can see oilseed rape flowers below sakura trees in the 1st photo
The yellow flowers are cute and beautiful by contrast with the pink sakura flowers
In the small river, that probably should be called brook or creek, wild \"medaka\" fish live
Medaka is Japanese rice fish
It is very popular in Japan, we love it very much
The youtube video shows you \"Medaka no gakkou\"; \"School of Japanese rice fish\", that is very popular traditional children's song
I'm afraid that wild medakas are very rare because they are in danger of extinction unfortunately
Anyway, we have a lot of hanami parties this weekend here and there in Japan and enjoy sakura
The typhoon has gone at all
Many people were killed and many buildings were broken
Natural disasters are too much cruel
I have a footrace today on Sunday
The race is held near my home, which is about 2km far
I have to walk outside in the morning
I will walk from one work site to another
I will carry some luggage, and I have to keep it from getting wet
Wireless LAN has something trouble
The wireless LAN in my house has something trouble right now
It doesn't make a connection well
I don't know what no why is happened
I don't have enough time to fix it
The very hot summer was gone
Time flies fast
I think it is very fast
We should spend the precious time more fruitfully, don't you think so
I think so all time, but I don't think I can do so
What do you think about it
How do you take care to spend your time fruitfully
Last night, he was wondering what liberal arts classes he choose
And she was worrying how to commute, on what route she goes to school by bicycle from the nearest station to her school
They are fresh newcomer, you know
I am so happy to see them starting their new school lives
I control myself not to help them too much
They should be prepare for their new lives by themselves
I hope they will be able to do kinds of things by themselves for their ages
It is somewhat hard for me and my wife to tolerate not to give them a hand on purpose
They seem little kids for us forever
We hope they two adjust to that new their school lives
The weather news said the rainy season had started here
Unfortunately, I didn't run one
This is an email to my new running friend who became friends with me recently on a runners SNS site
He is preparing to try to run sub-3 hours marathon at the Tokyo Marathon next month
He ask me when I am planing to give a first try to run sub-3
My PR is 3 hour 12 min at the last Lake Kawaguchi
My next try may be at the Arakawa River on March 21
And my first ultra marathon is the Challenge Fuji Five Lakes which will be on April 25th
So I am wondering if I should try to run sub-3 at Arakawa or to run at easier pace for keeping my physical condition well
I hope you can run sub-3
Go for it and Good luck
Many small makes a great
Everything is made of an aggregation of single small steps
Even to climb a big mountain, we should take each step at a time
We have a Japanese proverb like this, \"Chiri mo tsumoreba yama ni naru\", that means \"Many dust makes a big mountain
On the other hand, In English proverb, \"Many small makes a great\", \"Many drops make a shower\", and \"Many sands will sink a ship
It was said to be caused by infection disease of hemolytic streptococcus
I had sudden fever and pain in joints of whole body just like flu
I left work early, took OTC cold medicine, and go to bed to take a rest
I was suffering from the high fever and pain in whole body on the bed
Unfortunately, however, that was in vain
I felt terrible even when sitting on a chair caused by the fever then
I went to see a doctor
I was checked my nose mucosa and urine
My this disease was said an infection of hemolytic streptococcus
I was prescribed an antibiotic, adding to cold medicine, anti fever medicine, and stomach medicine
Joint pains was also relieved gradually
I will clean the room today
Well, I declare that I will clean this room today afternoon
I have to do what I declare
I can't keep away from doing what I make public on the internet
There are some books, some clothes, not any wastes, but some other goods
I will put them in appropriate places
OK, yes, I will do it this afternoon after I will come back home
I awake several times during sleeping at night because of the heat and humidity
We have sleepless days in this summer
I get up early in the morning to write my journals everyday, but today, I fell asleep again at desk, so I had no time to write a journal
This was my excuse of today
Many marathon races are cancelled in Japan because of the quake
I get a call which said that one on May 8th was cancelled
We will work for it as volunteer staff as usual
The chief organizer called me last night
We are very sorry, but can't be helped
My Kindle is dead at the first time
I forget that it is an electric device
I love this device with the low energy consumption e-Paper display instead of LCD one
After the heavy rain brought by the big typhoon, the river flow with the full width
I hope no more rain fall
I received boots that I bought from a web shop
They were very cool, much cooler than expected
I was pleased a lot, of course
However, I had a trouble
The size that I ordered was half-size smaller than my usual sneakers, but it was still bigger
So I asked the web shop to change them to smaller ones
I am waiting the replacement coming
I ran a long way round back home from work under the moonlight
It was almost full moon
We Japanese like full moon
I have heard that full moon is not liked very much in other countries
Is that because wolf men would come to you
For night runners it is better safe under lighter moonlight
After tough work, I called it a day about ten o'clock
I felt exhausted from yesterday work
I went to the locker room and changed clothes
When I got out of the building, I found it was raining, unfortunately
It was brightly sunny in daytime yesterday
I forgot to bring my umbrella at home
My coworker kindly proposed me to lend me his extra one
I asked his favor to lend it to me
So I could walk back home with an umbrella
But on the way home, the rain got heavier and heavier, it rained cats and dogs
I put the rain cover on my backpack not to got wet
After about thirty minute walk home, I got almost soaked
It is time for my son and daughter to decide their future course respectively
He has to select his major at his university and she has to select her university or universities she will go
They are thinking of their future course seriously and ask their parents, us, to advise them
I feel delighted that they are growing up, but a little lonely because they are going to leave us before very long
It is raining outdoor now
It was a long time since the last rain
This rain and heat in these days will enhance the growth of plants
For example, the lawn grass in our garden is now turning green
It is a hilly race which has long steep ascents and long steep descents, held around Mt
The elevation of the starting point is approximately 1000m high and the highest one seems 1300m
Adding to that, the temperature is said to reach 35 degrees Celsius tomorrow
What do you imagine from that name
We will enjoy the heat climate as well as the tough course of the race
Spring will come soon
Maybe it has already come
Moreover, the season of cedar pollen has come
I already feel something wrong with nose
And I have a runny nose now and then
It is because of the allergic rhinitis of cedar pollen
Many people must put up with the cedar pollen allergy for a wile in the Spring
We have runny nose, sneeze, eye itch, some fever, and so on
It is a very tough season
Are you okay everyone
Free from the hay fever or other allergic diseases
It was red with ton of red hot chili peppers and extremely hot
It was my first time to go to the ramen shop
I picked up a trash, that was a bread wrapping, on the road on the way to work the day before yesterday
Then, I felt good
It is very easy for us to pick up a trash, but we don't do so
The trash may be thrown by someone, not by myself
We may always think so
But when I picked it up, I felt good certainly
We shall do at least one good thing a day
Even if it is a slightly thing
To close conversations
I learned how to say for closing conversations
Surprisingly, maybe I have not learned that until now
I don't know why it is
I wonder if I may have forgot it
Well, words for closing conversation are very important to make ourselves feel good at our good conversation
For example, as a formula
We must get together sometime
I will say as mentioned above
It seems this week was short
Maybe it was because I was out of office to business trip for two days
I have a stuck of things to do in this week
Today will be a busy day for myself
USA team made a lead, Brazil turned a game around, USA caught up, Brazil lead, USA caught up again at the injury time of the extra game
Students were playing some kinds of exercises and mass games
This mass game means that many students dances synchronizingly in same dresses with musics
The dance is original by students and dresses are sewn by themselves
Thanks a lot for your corrections always
I appreciate you make corrections and leave comments on my journal all the time
Sometimes I am afraid if I can improve my English
But, NO, I realize I could
I will keep studying English here and will post journals everyday as possible
My wife and I went to a short trip to Hakone yesterday
It was my first time to take the train
The train climbs the very steep incline of Hakone mountain by the switching back way
There are some volcanic hot water springs and steams with sulfur smell
The black egg is famous, which is boiled in the volcanic hot spring and the shell is turned black caused by sulfur and iron compounds in it
They say we can live seven years longer by eating every one egg
We ate two eggs respectively, so we will be able to live 14 years longer and we can enjoy the extended lifetime
On the way back home, we enjoyed riding the older, cute retro style railroad cars, which has no air conditioners
we opened the windows and enjoyed the cooler air in the highland
We will go again in another season
My son moved
My son moved to his apartment yesterday to start his first single life
I feel glad that he grew up, but at the same time, I feel sad by missing him
My home seems like lacking some significant pieces
Would you please pray for his good luck
It is a word for rewarding everyone who works hard for whole week
My office is also a day off today, but I have to go to my office to get some parts of my lot of work done
It contains, for example, considering the experimental results for planning what to do next, and making a plan for long and medium-term R&D strategy, as well as writing a letter to Singapore for making the appointment to visit some research institutes there
I have a lot of work to get them done immediately
We will jog to the same site where my profile picture of Mt
Fuji was taken at the last run in2008
We will jog for 26km of total length, up to about 700m of elevation, and down back
We can have a greatly fun time while jogging very slowly, chatting each other about anything happened to us in this year
We have enough time to do that, because it takes about 4 hours to jog over today's course
After that, we will enjoy taking a hot spring and drinking some or a lot of beer
But, I am very sorry about the weather
Please stop raining and give us more sunshine 
Ran this race yesterday
High temperature, high elevation, much of long and steep uphills and downhills
Strong sun burned us through the clear air in the highland
In the shades, cooler breeze in the highland was cozy and water was very delicious
I love it
Here is a good news
I can't tell you how relieved we are with my poor English
She had made many efforts and had done very well
I hope, believe rather than hope, that the good news would come after the good news
My daughter, who is 16 years old, is now suffering from her stress
Her stress seems to cause her overeating
She says she doesn't know what makes her stress exactly
I hope she can overcome her stress and get back to her mentally healthy life
I would like someone advise her to overcome her stress
Why did the accident happen
There was a traffic accident on the road next the play ground while we were playing soccer
A truck suddenly ran into a fence of the ground
It ran over the sidewalk and ran into the chain-link fence at slow speed
The truck didn't so much collapsed, and another cars and people didn't get involved luckily
It was very luckily
We called a police and an ambulance
There came policemen, an ambulance
And also an fire-engine came there without knowing why, no fire was there
According to the policemen, the driver seemed to get unconscious while driving, and go into the fence
My friend also said the driver was not seen  at the crush, he seemed to have fallen down under the seat
But we weren't let to know why the driver had got unconscious
The driver was bring to a hospital by the ambulance
We hope him not to be in so bad condition and get better soon
Internet auctions afterward
I sold my unwanted things on internet auctions these days
I luckily got some money and had fun, more than expected
However, some items didn't attract anyone and no one bid on them
I wonder whether I had better to throw them off, or to drop their starting prices
We have planned blackouts for saving electricity
The blackouts will be planned to shut the electricity for three and half hours in Kanto, Tohoku and Chubu districts which divided into five areas in order
My area is the 4th area
This electric power cut will be continued for long time
My father in law visited our home the day before yesterday
He stayed here for a night and left for playing golf early in the morning yesterday
Our home are located near his favorite golf courses, so he often comes over to our home on the way to there
Have you ever heard it
Dan\" means deny, \"Sha\" means throw away, \"Ri\" means separate
We can get a simple life by denying, throwing away and separating from any bothering things around us
I have a lot of such things rarely used or almost wastes
I am sure you know my feeling
There is a common saying that \"疾風に勁草を知る\" in Japan
It has same meaning as an English proverb: In a calm sea every man is a pilot
The saying is translated to \"We can know which plant is a really strong one only in strong wind
We can know who is really tough only in tough situations
Adding to that, sometimes we may get into a difficult and tough situation of anything, we should think it is a good chance for improving ourselves
I'm sorry if it sounds too much didactic
I just happened to remember this saying while running in the headwind
Ran to th public bath
Friends and I had a plan for refreshing ourselves
That was, to jog to a public bath, which is called Sento in Japan, to take a bath together, and then to go for drink
Isn't it sounds good
We did enjoy it
About 2 hour jog was very fun while chatting with 4 men instead of the dark evening
We can have a day off from work tomorrow
We have two day holidays on weekend usually, but we had work last Saturday for avoiding the rotating power cuts
It was irregular, so I felt that I could not refresh enough last weekend
However, while the warmer the weather gets, the less the electricity consumption
So we will not have power cuts for a wile at least in this April
Written above is not the April Fool, of course
Hoping world peace
We everyone hope world peace
We have many friends all over the world thanks to development and spread of internet communications
For example, we can use useful sites like this site lang-8
The development of science technologies must be used for realizing world peace and for reducing starvation and poverty
We should make every efforts to realize world peace
What can we ourselves do for that
Marathon race yesterday
I ran a marathon race yesterday
For the practice of next weekend's ultra marathon, I planned to run at the ultra pace, about 6'30\" \/ km
It was not so easy to run at slower than the comfortable pace
So instead of that, I ran there alone yesterday
I like Fuji Five Lakes, which have nice scenery
I felt very good, but a little alone while running
Anyway, it was a good substitution
A nice new week
Another new week started
I have a headache a little this morning
The weather forecast said it would be cooler from Monday last week
it said it would be cooler from Tuesday on Sunday, from Wednesday on Monday
Summer is still staying here and Fall hasn't come here
Some young worms of butterflies are on the branches of citrus trees in our garden
Our lemon tree and grapefruits trees are almost leafless
I hope they can turn beautiful butterflies
Hang in there, Japan National Team! 
Yesterday Japan National Soccer Team won Denmark one and can advance to the knock-out stage
We Japanese were very glad of that
In spite of the time of the game, it was 3, early in the morning, or late in the night, many people watched the game on TV
To tell the truth, we didn't really expect the advances of Japan Team, because they lost all of test games before the World Cup
So we didn't believe they would be able to advance to the final tournament, called the knock-out stage
We are very glad and proud of their awesome plays and performances
We hope they could win the games one after another in the tournament
Hang in there, Japan Team
I share you an interesting figure
Which way do you see the cat is turning, clockwise or counterclockwise
Happy Merry Christmas to you all
I had also some time to review the questions
I thought it was better than last time, which was taken last year
However, the better I think is not always the better the score is
I hope I could get good score
I think my English skill is getting better step by step
I worked late till about 11pm yesterday
I got tired very much
So did yesterday too
I ran back home from work for half an hour at about 11pm last night
Half sleeping while running
My eyes half shut
I was about to sleep while running
I slapped myself on the cheeks sometimes not to get to sleep on the way
I didn't think I could not do so, but now I think I probably can
But it will be very dangerous, of course you know
We must be careful on the way not to get in an accident
Cut the hedge
I made a heavily pruning this time
Twelve big dust bags were filled with cut blanches and leaves
I hit a bike on the way home from office last night
The accident happened on the dark sidewalk
The bike ran approaching straight toward me from my front side
I stepped to my right side
He turned to my same side unfortunately, so the bike bumped straight into me
The bike fell down and the biker fell on the ground, too
I worried about his head, but he said he was alright
The bike speed was not very fast, so he had no injury
I had no injury at all luckily
Did I got interviewed
I interviewed some applicants, who were university students or graduate school students
They presented their work at their university at first, and we asked some questions for examining whether they are appreciate to join our company or not
It was my first time to do this
So I was somewhat nervous, of course less nervous than applicants
I'm sure it was very difficult to estimate someone's abilities, at least for me now
It seemed to me that they all are great guys now or in the future, even some of them didn't make very good presentation at this time
I felt fatigued,even exhausted after finished all the interviews
We have much rain in this season
I completely get soaked by the rain
My body needs longer sleep
They are two weekly reports and one monthly report, to my laboratory president
Hot summer has gone
It was cooler last night
Has hot summer gone with the rain at last
I feel glad if it will be true, but at the same time, I feel kind of sorry
How was this summer for you
How did you enjoy this summer
I ran some detour before heading to office
While jogging along Sakawa river path, I caught up with a runner and cheered him, we didn't know each other by then, we jogged along and chatted for a while
He said he is planning to run a half marathon next month and practicing for it
I didn't know the Father's Day was not the event only in Japan
It said \"Thanks, dad.\" I was very pleased, of course
We should do good to our parents, needless to say
I made an entry into an 100km marathon race
It is \"100km\" marathon
it is twice longer than an ordinary \"42.195km\" marathon
It will be held in April 25th, 2010
This is my first time to run a 100km race, so I don't know what will happen to me in the race and whether or not I will be able to finish it
I will do training and enjoy running myself and I will definitely accomplish it
What will happen to me when I can finish it
It is taller and bigger and has many flowers than other kinds
It starts blooming from the southern part to the northern part of Japan, so the the Sakura-Zensen , the front line of cherry blossom, goes for the north day by day
I went jogging to one of the famous cherry blossom seeing sites to check the degree of its blooming
They will not start blooming
I thing two weeks later will be best timing to see and enjoy them
I will go running a maranic today
This maranic is not a marathon competition race, but a marathon distance of easy fun run
The word \"maranic\" is made of the marathon and picnic
It is very fun and good for a marathon training
I should be careful not to slip down
This photo was the view of the rural area which has a paddy field and Mt
I took this photo yesterday while running at the cycling road where I jog weekly
The paddy field doesn't have water in winter
It was a very fine day with no cloud in the sky
The sharp contrast is very beautiful among the blue of the sky, the white of the snow on the mountain, and the color of withered rice plants on the soil
The rainy season front line stays near Japan during the period because of the power balance among the high pressure systems and the low pressure systems
The rainy season brings us a lot of harvests in the coming summer and autumn as well as rain
He becomes 41 years old
He has been living in Fukuoka, where is Kyusyu area, in the eastern part of Japan
The elder one entered to his elementary school this April
The two brothers are very vigor and said to have fights constantly by their mom
I wonder if my brother and I made fights with ourselves in our childhood
Well, the 41years old is said to be the critical age for a man in Japan
My daughter and mi wife are arguing now again
My daughter is in her regular exam now
She is not in the very good condition mentally because she has injury in her shin and can't play badminton which she love
She is not in a good mood and that makes her mother angry
Women are difficult, whether young or not so young
We have \"No overtime work day\" of our company on every Sunday
We must leave office before 5:25
It doesn't matter if we finished today's work or not, we must wrap them up and leave
We Japanese are so diligent, even containing somewhat ironic meaning, that we have a tendency to work too much
Someone might happen to lose his health
To say the truth, we may feel relief while working on everyday's stuffs, and may feel somewhat anxious while we have some free hours in the evening on a weekday
We don't have any idea what to do and how to spend it
Working overtime has been like a routine
About one year passed since the No overtime day began, we are now enjoying our after-fives in each ways
TOEIC test
It takes 150 minutes consisting of the listening test and the reading test
We need to keep concentrating during its long testing time
I have been studying a bit hard for it
This is my fourth test
I will do my best in order to get a high score on the exam
The thermometer said my fever of 39 degrees C
I had no headache or no stomachache, but only high fever
It was a long time since last time I had caught a cold
It was getting harder to work, to walk, to stand up gradually
I took a cold medicine and a fever reducer, then I went to bed to lie down to rest
In the afternoon, the fever was reduced and I was getting better and better
I have an eye pain now
My eyes got bloodshot
It's probably because of a sun burnt
I spent many time under the sunshine yesterday
waterfall training
I saw this yesterday on the way of the trail running on the mountain trail with friends
They were beaten by the very cold water under the waterfall while yelling some Buddhist sutra
I am not sure but they may be training as Buddhist monks or for becoming Buddhist monks
As you see, they were almost naked except only Fundoshi's, that is Japanese traditional men's underware, I don't have my own, unfortunately
Have you ever done the waterfall training or seen like this actually
I think you don't like blisters, too
I cut the skin and remove the body fluid in the blister by myself
Now, It doesn't hurt any more
Although I think you good boys should not emulate this my action
You had better see a doctor or something, maybe
Two rabbits, a big crab, side face of a woman, ..., Please tell let me know that
I will transfer to another section
My wife and daughter live in my house
My family will split
We have cooler nights these days than before
They are good for getting goon sleep
They can be
But I can't get good sleep for a couple of months
I have only shallow and short sleep
I wake up several times in the night almost every day
I feel sleepy in the daytime
It is not efficient to work while I feel sleepy
I am in trouble with it
That was why I couldn't run to work and not go out for a lunchtime jog
I wanted to run because I'm now going on challenging to run every single day, you know, as posted a few days before
Therefore, I dared to run through the rain back home from work in my casual wear, which was not for running, like a pair of jeans, a casual shirt and a jacket, and additionally with the umbrella up
I probably looked like a person in a hurry to somewhere, for example, not to be late for a train, work, dinner, or something
Anyway I could get some run yesterday
Three cold and four warm
It is raining outdoors just now
it is a cold rain
I hope it is not so cold in Tohoku disaster area
Everyone can do it, but anyone don't either want to do it or do it in practice
I started this goal last December
I ran at the gym in the heavy rain sometimes
It was very lucky for me achieving the goal that my local region in Kanagawa pref
That said, anyway, it is not so easier said than done
It will be fine today, so I can run outside, and I will achieve my goal
I can't help waiting to go running today
The letters with fountain pens look better than those with ballpoint pens, I think
The feeling of writing is more smooth, so it's more comfortable for me, too
It is a casual, not expensive, but stylish one
I set an ink converter on it, filled my favorite ink in it, and wrote some letters
I loved it
But there was something trouble with it
It must be repaired
or replaced?, I wondered and asked to the pen shop I bought from
They said that a repair is not necessary, it will be all right with washing, drying up and resetting the ink converter
And then, the ink stopped leaking from my favorite pen
I loved it more than before, needless to say
At the ambassador  secretary office
I went to an ambassador secretary office to have a meeting yesterday
It was the first time to go to such place
I didn't have any of such opportunities ever before
It was for discussing about our visit to the country
I met an ambassador secretary and talked with him
He spoke Japanese very fluently as if he was Japanese and introduced us his country's industry and economy, which is his work, of course
He may probably become an ambassador or at something important post some day, I believe
This visit was very good experience for myself
I went to a barbershop to make my hair cut
But the shop was closed unfortunately
It is usually open on weekend
I think it should open on weekend
Were there any troubles or something over the shop
I wish you have a great year 2011
I gonna go to see the first sunrise at the top of a mountain
Both teams scored and scored, the match was 2-2 after the game
In the extra game, both teams added goals, and the match went into a penalty shootout
I was very excited to watch the game
That's why I am now lack of sleep
My brother took his fiancee to our home to introduce her
We we were a little nervous at first, but we made friends with each other soon
She is a very nice women
We are also pleased that their marriage
I watched the world cup qualifying game of Japan against Uzbekistan late last night
It was a kind of exciting game
But Japan team looked like less aggressive, so they could not get goals until the second half
I thought they had to be more aggressive for getting goals
They have to shot more
I ran a 10km race at the monthly road race yesterday
That is my 40th consecutive race of the monthly road race
It was freezing cold and sleeting furthermore yesterday
Usually, about 30 participants run
8 or more newbies joined us this time, and around 70 ran in that condition
Running, and jogging got very popular now in Japan, because of the recent health consciousness
More than 200 thousand sent applications to the Tokyo Marathon 2010, it was far more oversubscribed
Running boom is now in Japan
What about in your country
I wish spring is coming soon
It is cold everyday
I wish spring is coming soon
I will go to a business trip from today even during my summer holidays
Did this business trip make me not to go to our private trip
No, we planned to go to our private trip after my business trip
I will go to Kobe on my business trip, and after that, I will join my family to go to Kyoto

In addition, we have one TV shared among our family
I want to see some series of dramas at top priority
I like a historic story, a suspense story, an action story, and so on, and keep them in the HDD
How can I pick up from them
I went to office yesterday, on Saturday, because I had some work to do
But I couldn't concentrate on my work then, so I called it a day early and went shopping and browsing for refreshing myself
I bought an used pair of levis for my daughter
It was a nice shopping
It seems to us a kind of Fall sounds
Several kinds of insects , or bugs, are singing their love songs
While I didn't notice that, buzzing of summer cicadas decreased and singing of fall insects increased
Sounds of fall as well as smells of fall are increasing around us
Methods for training of the brain for victory for runners by Prof
Nariyuki Hayashi, who is a professor of Dept
of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Nihon Univ., are quoted below
Imagine concretely what you implement
Make your best efforts and 100% concentration even at a  training
Be sensible to keep a good posture
Keep your tension even when reducing the amount of practices before races
Have a strong will to do it by yourself
I suppose it is great and these are not only for runners but for all of us
No hesitating to
Spam Mails
I received some spam mails on lang-8 consequently these days
These spam mails came from various women
I am not sure they actually are women, but at least woman's names
They ask me to send them an email
They don't have neither journal entries nor friends
Did you have similar mails

I loved the new route
The quake hit seriously some nuclear power plants in the northern Japan
There are serious damages there
It is now under serious emergency
Their core were overheated and melt down, so the experts have been working on it

It is exciting, very much exiting
I can't help waiting for it
Besides, we have to save electricity this summer, especially
There are many people sent to hospital with heat stroke so far
We have to take care of our health in this hot summer even without much electricity consumption
I watched a TV drama named \"Inspectors of Atami\" recorded in a HDD recorder
It is a drama series including 8 episodes
I watched an episode before the final yesterday
The main casts are Joe Odagiri, who is famous for a good looking actor, and Chiaki Kurihara, who played in \"Kill Bill\" as a crazy murderer
Some other good actors play in the drama as important supporting characters
The real criminal was not identified, but the mystery will be clarified soon
We had record heavy rain here and there in Japan
Trains were stopped and a lot of roads are closed to traffic
My daughter had to sit and wait in the stopped train for a long time on the way from high school
The typhoon caused serious damages to several areas in Japan
Some houses, many cars, and so on were swept away by the overflowed water
I appreciate you everyone for your corrections and comments on my journals
I am very grateful for your kindness, from bottom of my heart
I think that is why I can post journals everyday even if they are slight and not useful for anyone
Anyway, do you think we had better to request friends to someone who corrected our journals
But I can correct only Japanese post
What do you think about it
How is your place
To trim some branches of trees, to weed the garden, to mow the lawn, and to fertilize them with the chemical fertilizer
These were nicely done, and the garden got looked better
World cup soccer
The world cup soccer games is now held in South Africa
There was a game of Japan team against Cameroon late last night
Surprisingly, Japan team won the game
To tell the truth, I could not complete to watch the game on TV, I fell asleep at about the end of the 1st period
p) I am sorry that I could not watch the whole game in real time
This current Japan team is said to be not so strong as former ones
However, nevertheless, they won the first game
We, not only soccer fans, but also many Japanese people, are glad to hear the good news and will cheer the Japan national soccer team more than ever
Full moon and many thunders
I saw a full moon and many thunders at the same time last night
The full moon was in the southern sky and the thunders flashed far away in the northern sky many times
What a beautiful and funny summer night it was
The weather report said the state of atmosphere was not stable, so recordingly heavy rain fell in Hokkaido
But Kanto area, where we live in, we have very few rain these days
The plants in the pots are dried up
The unstability of the state of atmosphere shows the changing the season, I guess
My daughter and wife is quarreling now
It caused by a trivial thing
Such as, what time to wake her up, whether to make her lunch box, and so on
My daughter is annoying her injury on her shin
It prevent her from playing badminton at her school club activity
She is very nervous for it
This gives my wife the irrits at all
They started arguing and heated up
My wife got angry and mad at all
It is in a bad mood now
I wonder how I can reconcile them
What do you do for your old and unwanted clothes
We Japanese clean our house on the year-end
So did our family

So I have to bring them again this weekend
I got tired but I had a fruitful work
I will run Tokyo Marathon today
Breakfast, dressing, and so on, I gonna go now
I could not get up early as usual
Once, I got up, but I set an alarm and fell asleep again
The marathon in the summer burning heat made me worn out
My body needed enough sleep to recover last night
This is the excuse for getting up late this morning
It was my first time to go there
It takes about one and half hour to go there
Taking a local train, a super express for an hour, and driving a car for more than half an hour
I am wondering if I can get used to this commute
Started at 1pm on Saturday, ran laps in Hiratsuka Sougou Kouen Park, relayed among 7 members in our team, battled against the heat in the daytime and the sleepiness in the night, and at last finished at 1pm on Sunday with unmeasurable sensation
It was my first time to run the 24h relay, I was very excited and loved it
The committee includes representatives from some companies and works for about one year
We broke into some work groups to study issues
Surprisingly, I was appointed as a work group leader yesterday
It seems a big task
I think I will do my best
My wife I went shopping to Machida, where is a suburban city of Tokyo
It took about one hour by train from our home

It is certainly very good as expected
I will put on it for today's business trip

About a hundred of 5 to 10 centimeter cut of runners or stalks of vital lawn grass were planted on the dead area of them
After that, I water them a lot
I hope they will root and grow up soon
I wonder if it is so hot that they will be dried up
Well, the grass is a type of summer grass, so I guess they can grow up well, I'm sure
I love gardening even in hot summer
I can have a peaceful time
She becomes 71 years old
We will take the Shinkansen super express for about 3 hours
We love my brother and his wife
We wish they will have a very happy life forever
We are having a get-together at work tonight, so I didn't run but walk to work in 30min this morning
That's because I don't want to go the restaurant with my usual running gears on
When not running, It is too cold with them on enough to get a cold
I put on trousers, a knit, and a coat today unlike usual me
Excuse for today's overslept
I came home late last night from the business trip by packed train
It was very tough to take that much crowded train
It was so packed that I couldn't breeze well in the train
Is this an enough excuse for overslept today
He put some fishes into my tank, which were unfamiliar for me
This was a story in my dream several days ago

BTW, there is another one
My daughter will take the entrance examination to the high school of her choice in the week after next, too
They take the exam, not I
What can I do for them now as their father
To cheer them up, to take care of their conditions, 
no, it may be their own tasks
What I can do is only to be as usual
I went for cycling to Kamakura with my wife yesterday
This cycling is our annual event in Golden Week holiday

It is famous for very fresh seafood
visit to the shrine, Turugaoka Hachimangu
We could have a wonderful holiday
My LAN rooter has two networks
The PC and the printer were not in the same network, so the PC could not print any documents by the printer
I set them in the same one to make the PC recognize the printer on its network
One of my challenges finished
Straight days running finished finally
It was abnormally cold yesterday for a Spring day
Furthermore, It has been raining all the day
Thus, one of my challenge to run every single day at last
My record was the straight 123 days eventually
Another three days weekend
I will run 24 hour relay race at the Hiratsuka Park
We will compete in the distance how long we can run in 24 hour
It will be very fun
Actually I don't like to run soaking in the rain especially in early Spring
If I run in the warm season like Summer, I like running in the rain
Anyway, I prepared to get soaked during the marathon
Do you wear your wristwatch on when you go out for jogging or running
But I also felt free from the time, then
I have always ran while thinking how fast, how long time, how long mileage I run
Running must not be always an competition against someone
We can enjoy it more
We can enjoy just running, that is easier, more relaxed, as walking and hiking, for example
Put it off and leave it in your home, and go out for running
And then, you can probably feel very good
The Meteorological Agency announced the rainy season in wide area including Kanto was finished yesterday
I felt hotter and less humid yesterday than before
After working long overtime, I ran back home from my office for refreshing myself last night
New years days are seem to me as if they were yesterday
By the way, we should have a worth time every day and every month
My new months resolution is that I will write entries everyday on February
I am very sorry that my today's entry doesn't contain any contents
It seems just for declaration of my resolution
Which is correct, \"February begins\" or \"February starts\" 
To your family, to your friends ,to your neighbors, to your coworkers, to anyone, and so on
There are many people taking a morning walk or cycling
Most of them greet back, too
I feel happy to exchange morning greetings with warm smiles, don't you think so
I think It would be a nice day when I could exchange good greetings with people
I will go to the Yokota Air Base to run a marathon today
It's clear in the air
It's sunny in the sky
It's brightening and shining
It is her first date in her life
She went to the Tanabata Festival in Hiratsuka, which is one of popular festivals here
Well, this post is not about the date of Hikoboshi and Orihime, who are the couple of the Tanabata regend, but the one of my daughter and her boy friend
It took a long time for choosing clothes and for makeup
She asked me many times ifshe looked odd
Of course she looked very pretty for me

Do you remember of your first date
Of course it was my great sweet memory
Climbing Mt.Fuji, but couldn't finish 
My wife and I went climbing Mt
Fuji, but on the way, I felt bad and dizzy maybe because of the low blood sugar or high-altitude sickness
I had to go back after coming the seventh station
Difficulty of posting daily news
I decided to make everyday posts on the lang-8 journal at the beginning of this year as my new years resolution
But I found it very difficult to constantly post journals on every single day
At first, For what do I post
And I want to make friends with foreign people
The second, What do I post
The ordinary stuffs around me may be ordinary for me, but may not be ordinary for you especially in foreign countries
I always understand it
If I do it, I want to write interesting and useful journals, eh
Here
I could make today's post
I finished enjoying browsing boots which to buy, and decided to buy a good pair of boots at last
They are early Christmas present for myself
I ordered them at a shop on the web
I couldn't have found the same type of boots in stores nearby, so I ordered them at the web shop
I am slightly afraid that they will fit my feet
I think they can be fit because they are lace-to-toe boots
I am looking forward to receive them
A big and strong typhoon is coming
It is now near on the south of Japan on the Pacific Ocean and going north toward Japan very slow

We had an important meeting of our business yesterday
I could not wake up at usual time
anyway, TGIF

In Japanese, \"Ittekimasu\", which means \"I will leave home.\" and \"Tadaima\" : \"I just come back home
I ask your favor to tell me that
I also what to know those in other languages
Yesterday, I could complete the long distance ultra marathon
Fuji and beautiful lakes is great, many volunteers work for runners very kindly, and many local people in the area cheer very friendly and warmly
I ran this race for the second time, At the first time, last year, I had run 100km
It was very tough more than expected
But I got it
But it is even somewhat comfortable
We will discuss not only the team tasks and also individual tasks there
It is very important for us to do good jobs
I hope it will be a meaningful and worth meeting
I will make it
Did you make your new year's resolution in 2011
To be nicer to others around than before, especially to my wife
To put priorities not to myself but to others
I have to clarify the goal at first
To complete my first 112km ultra marathon on the end of April
I want to have friends of English speaker
Do I have some stresses
We enjoy running and viewing the beautiful sunset and the color changing of the sky to the dusk
We spoke various things while running
I am sure she is at the age of weight-conscious
Most women are sure to wish to lose weight, not at special age, but at all age
We have a fun time
I went to watch the Harry Potter movie yesterday
It was the last episode of the Harry Potter series
I enjoyed the movies of this series as well as Harry Potter books
The main characters grew up through the series in several years, the actors and actresses did, too
The last episode was interesting
But if you will go to see the movie, you had better to read the original work before going to the cinema
If you do that, you can enjoy much more
But it started raining late at night unfortunately
I could not run back home in the rain, so I took a train to home for about an hour
But I did not have usual cloth but only sports outfit for running, such as no sleeves and half pants
I took train with the outfits
So there were not many people in the train and at the stations
I felt ashamed, even I knew no one looked at me
I will dance at the year-end party of my devision tomorrow
It will be like a short performance of myself
I have to learn ,to keep in my memory, and to dance by myself in front of my colleagues at the party
I have some of not expensive pens
They cost not more than 10 dollars per each one
They are for casual use
I can write with them more smoothly than with ballpoint pens with the  viscous oil-based ink
I can use various beautiful colors of ink for fountain pens made by Mont
Blanc, Perikan, Sailor, and so on
The bottles of the inks are very beautiful, too
I enjoy writing with them at work and at home everyday
The last thing that I have to do is just only to write valuable things like articles, journals, essays, paintings, 
I like early morning in summer
It has distinct atmosphere, don't think so
Early birds are singing and the air is fresh before the sunrise
It seems to get hot today, but we can feel fresh in the early morning
The another hot day will begin today also
I am busy at work in these days
The monthly total of overtime was over 100hours in straight two months
I have to do many things on my job, to achieve many big and small goals
I have to do daily, weekly and monthly reports to my big bosses respectively
I feel time flies
My body feel sore here and there
And many other walking events are held in Japan
The Old and the young take part in the events and enjoy walking and the sceneries where we walk while walking
It was a very nice weather yesterday
Not so cold and hot, without chilly wind
We enjoyed walking in the rural area, orange field, riverside, oceanside, and so on
Those gave me some muscle sore
I make a habit to get up early and study English in the morning
However, I could not get up early these days
Even I wake up once, I get back to sleep again for about an hour
I want to get up early in my mind, but my body want to sleep more
It may be because I can't sleep well in the night
Well, It's all right
I don't think I have to blame myself for this oversleep
I want to rate all of them highly, but I can not do so, as you know
Some can be highly-rated, and others can not be
I feel sorry for them all the time
We came back home from Kobe right now
Japan National Team couldn't win the game with Paraguay yesterday
The game went into the penalty shoot outs and Japan lose in it, unfortunately
It has been growing very fast in these days
I couldn't cut them last weekend, so they have grown too high
I think I would cut them this weekend, but it's a pity that I can't do so due to the rain now
I should put off that till the next weekend
I start Lang-8
I'm student
Einlish is very hard
Japanese should wake up and recover identity to live humble and simple and withdrawing too much importing for food
So is my husband, Louis
★He said that Is it the world of SF
My boss said you must be today’s charge, well, they need to be able to talk politely
My boss said that you should plan if the content of the training didn’t change the basis
The bosses of this hotel were too strict with people newly, and a lot of new faces have left it so far
I wanted to make the training more cheerful and wanted to give new employees a good feeling, and I planned the training
My boss said that you should plan if the content of the training didn’t change the basis
By the way, the raining includes lingustic training
I'm not very good with one
Because only I have not lived abroad in all the employees
Therefore I have been study English, Russian, Korean, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese but they are imperfect knowledge
Next,I have to be fluent in Korea to use in a hotel
Thos are English which we practiced today
Anytime next week will be fine
Your room is 1230 on the 1277th floor
One in them said over laughing that it can’t be
Is it the world of SF
laugh also by another man it said
And a new employee said whether the hotel was in the space colony
I asked her what is so funny
One woman said that everybody who laughed in such a thing had low level of the brain
I thought that’s late to stop now 
Therefore,　I said I have more responsibility, but I get paid the same now
Then all new employees laghed again
However, I was serious a little bit.～～；
Maybe I think that I will apologize for having made it petty training to my boss
It is better not to be
【A so long episode】　P.S. So sorry, it is a too long sentence, it's all light only reading
I had been in a difficult situation all this week long
In my company, while I had gone to South Korea to take an official trip till yesterday, the problem was
I heard a problem for the first time yesterday
That is my boss A stage a workout and is not at our office any longer for three days
★The cause is because our company's a boss B decided to get fire his subordinatesr(=They are my colleagues
I asked me for my boss B after all because boss A was closed when I decided three people who made it restructure from your fellow workers
I declined it, and I was absent my job like boss A, too
My boss A was surprised to say that you have courage that you refused my request
Because boss B closed our company if even you who were calm were angry at me, boss B said that I forgave your the opinion
He became a severe look and was standing with a moment silence in front of me
The next day and I were invited to his room
He said to me,To that end,you must work of my instruction harder
Because of it,I did not give long national holiday of the May
So,I have been getting the National holiday of the taking the place since yesterday
Probably my character is cheerful, but I feel complicated for the problem unconsciously
I want be indespensable to our work place
I planing to go to Canada on business next week
But I go abroad, I suffer from jet lag on period of ※April and May
Even a Dr
didn't know the cause
If it is a Korean business trip, I do not make the worry near from our country to there
Maybe from now on, I am going to refuse the business trip
I am hesitating
Because I have never been to Canada
My comming back 1st time
It has been over one week that I do not sign in this corner, today I find that there is not any new friend visit here, perhaps I need spend more time on this platform, but how can I finish my works
My nickname \"Unicorner\" means \"the corner of you & I\", friends from all over the world are welcome to visit this corner and leave words
Usually students feel sleepy in the afternoon class, so the teacher asked us some interesting tests,

I don’t like online game, it has no good story, and all you need to do is beat the monsters again and again then it’s never end…
But many people enjoy that because they could make friends by beat boss monster or defend their castle together
It really provides good social function but just not what I’m looking for
If I’m serving on a jury, I will say that three remains were guilty, even the cabin boy as a volunteer to sacrifice himself, and even the cabin boy was the loser of their lottery game
Some people might said, the cabin boy just an orphan, and the remains have families, and the boy’s life made all three of them alive
But in my opinion, no one has power to decide other should be alive or die, if we consent to they were no choice to kill the cabin boy for living, does it means which we believe in human rights, such as all men are born with the natural right to life, could be breakable in special occasions
On last Tuesday, I felt tired from  morning, but I managed to go to the college

In contrast to my look, I'm arduous
Moreover, I tresured these days I do my best
I might be flying when I goal in
I'm confused means of them
For example, There is some sentence
It's very hot weather all day a long
I rode my bike and went along the sea
At last, I arrived \"A big zelkova\" in Galhwa
On my back way, I saw blue sky and green field when a sunset went down
That was beautiful I saw than ever
I thought that today is very special day
It's a long time
SO, I'm expecting to spend great time
At first, I buy some new clothes so that I attend my graduation ceremony
That is comes true
What I made me angry
I always enjoy borrowing some books
So I couldn't lend any books
It had very exhausted me
On my back way, I drop by the Academy Photoshop
I can't remind that I expressed the shop by English
There is the place which take a picture or sell some film
I had trouble taking my photographics 
because The shop owner let me waste my time
I hate to wait time
She said me, \" Please wait about 1 hours
As time goes by, She said me, \" Wait
some moment
She told me same thing over and over again
At last, I waited over time more than 30 min
She had better speak to me, \"Could you come back tomorrow
I can't stand wait for over time and tell a lie
I'll naver come again there
I studied TOEIC, but I don't know what sentence is correct
The cost would be compared\/ compable

However, answer is 'resistance

It's been for 4 years that I came to U

Tonight I saw the film version of \"The Phantom of Opera\" at home, which is played on TV for almost three hours
But its music is really fantastic, the leading actress' voice deeply appealed to me
Their beautiful voice have impressed me a lot, surely like a haunting melody in my mind
I was truly touched by the sentimental movie, especially when the phantom let Christine and Raoul go, I cannot help but shed my tears
I sympathize with the phantom a lot though he is sometimes too cruel, but I think it's the society that made him crazy
How solitude he was
It's a pity that he cannot bring his talent into full play
He is a genius
Well, since I will go to NY this summer vacation, I expect to go to Broadway for watching this show on the scene
Sometimes I may be confused when I am going to ask someone out for dining or accompany
Japanese is so charismatic and magical that can express what you want to say clearly but not so strongly
Through the language, I can relieve myself from the sense of unsafety in my interpersonal relationships
While I am exactly expecting to write in Japanese, I have found that I cannot type in Japanese in my computer
To polish my Japanese writing skills, it's time to download the software of typing in Japanese
And I have to do my homework
In the night, I will do a part time job
I'm a bakery
I will play with my friend this Sunday
Then I do a part time job too
I can't wait summer vacation
My summer vacation will start from September
I am looking forward to do all of them
I will go to Tokyo with my friends and go to the recreation with another friends
I have to do a part time job, because I don't have money very much
I want to do many things that I can do now while I am student

I said that this writing go on everyday, but I omit it right away・・・・lol
Well…today, the Japan was ringing with the osama bin laden
It was junior high school student that I have heard his name for the first time
Learning other language is a joyful thing
This situation writing some letters in English to here is a little step of the pleasure
The imagination that someone will fix my mistakes and wrong grammer make me so excited
I need to know a plenty of expressions and I believe these practices will give me many changes to getting some more
By the way, in Australia the heavy rain brought the flood, causing damage
Children is soooooooooooooooo cute T.T
I major art
Currently I got a part time job in child art institute
In Korean age is 4 to 10
I think the cutest age is 3 and 4 years old
They are more pureness and straightforwardness
Today in the morning, my face is puffy (a lot) because I drunk (heavily) last night
Then the cutest child came to me and looked at me for long time
And she tilted her head as if questioning this woman is who
And then she left silently
Yes, she scarcely recognized me
I went after her and asked her, who am I and how I look today
Her usually saying is “you’re pretty!” and I wanted to hear this word again
I want to deny my face is not puffy… so I want to deny I’m not ugly today…
But she silently said “you are
you look somnolently” (I didn’t open my eyes well because my eyes also puffy
so she thought that
I don’t write anymore
my eyes still puffy because of my tears
We are really nothing in the universe Part1
I didn't really know what to write about for my first Journal, so i decided to pick the first subject that came to my mind
Sometime  when I watch the sky during my daily walk to University I get this strange  feeling inside of me, it's like I'm getting sick of something
I don't really know how to describe the feeling, but it starts when I think about what lies beyond our solary system and how tiny we are
When I was a kid I always had an astronomy book in my hand, looking at picture of the Giant Jupiter, Saturn and all of her halos and learning about how universe in general without understanding the whole proportion and concept behind it
But since I saw the Ultra Deep Field, taked by the Hubble telescope, my vision of the universe totaly changed
The number of galaxies was so huge that I couldn't compare it to anything I knew
I'm going to post this journal in multiple parts, because I'm worried that it's going to be too long to correct
japanese culture
This year,in2010
I want to start to learn Japanese culture
For example,how to put kimono on
japanese tea,or japanese flower arrangement
Though I am Japanese, I don't know japanese culture well
My grandmother gave me some kimonos
but I don't know how to fold them
I want to enjoy japanese culture this year
I had no free time and I felt extremely bored, not just a moment, is all the day
I gave out most of the time for \"studying
Afternoon, I had to go school for the silly commencement exercises rehearsal
It just let us state in our sit and waiting
Nothing I had to do
In my feeling, waiting is worse than working
After the rehearsal, I thought it may go better
However, nothing was changing
I went to Tin Shui Wai for my Cantonese oral exam but I had waited again
When I arrived the exam site, I thought it will go very fast
Meanwhile, Icould go home and play basketball
Sadly, I waited one hour for the exam started and used about 45 minutes to finish my oral exam
Finally, it's easily to understand, I didn't have any time to do things that I wanted to do and I had been bored for a day
I had no idea that when will the weather become better
I also had to pick up my clothes on my body while going to school like yesterday
Now,I get worried and worried
I am worried that I cannot get the good results and I am afraid that I will have no exit if I make worst in this exam
As I am the last year examinee in 2010 HKCEE,I have no take two because the course will be change after the last HKCEE
Desperation is coming to me
I really don't know how to handle my desperated emotion,even if I make my effort for inhibit it
The devil is suffering me
Does anyone can helpme to run away from the hell
Liar game, which is a Japanese drama, is a interesting drama
If you haven't seen this drama, I suggest you to relish it as fast as you can
This drama is about the fight between intellect and intellect
And everyone in the game must lie to the other, and also not to be deceived by the other
There are many games in this drama and every games are the ordeal of intellect
Meanwhile, every games are the psychological warfares
Now, I had been watched season 1 & 2 of Liar games
And I'm looking forward to watch the movie of Liar game, the final stage too
Today was Friday
And I woke up at 7 o'clock in the morning and prepared to go to school
In the time of studing at school, it's very hard to go through
Most of the school time, I just continued writing and writing
Even I didn't have time for a rest
I had communicated and chatted with the foreign
I thought this was really a extremely good experience for me to improve my English level
Today was Monday, the first day to go in every week
But, first day is the hard day
Maths day
Since all of the day, I had used many time to practice and do Maths and A
I was very tired for calculate those difficult questions
After the school bell ringed, I really hope that I could back to home for a rest
However, the reality is always cruel
I must keep staying at school for making up a missed lesson in order to prepare the HKCEE
I was extremely tried today
Stop hidding!\", I told myself
Although I don't know if I am able to do it or not
Or maybe I will give up very soon
However, start from now, I told to myself that I must stop hidding
Just now, I have realize that I was hidding in my world of spirit
But I must stop hidding now
I must get out of this place, with brave
I have to be more confident to face the reality
Also, I should try my best to tackle the difficulties
I must come out of my little world which is simply inside my brain
Maybe keep staying in this world is a very great thing but I realize that is nothing help to me
Maybe I can still try to escape the reality, but now I really understand one thing, I must come out
I know, I know that prehaps I will give up and come back to my little world very soon, even worse
But whatever, everything must have a start
To say about friends, all of us will easily associate the persons who give you a room to express your emotions
Meanwhile, they're the persons who play with you, happy for your happy, sad for your sad
I don't know wheather I'm too intellective or I'm so ruthless
I want to know, I want to know that all
Maybe I'm just don't want to be too close to the other
Maybe my mind of self-protection is too strong
I can only ensure one thing, sometimes I simply want to be alone
That's a long time that I didn't online on my diary
Since there's a very big exam that I had to focus, I didn't have any time to do the other things
I can say that my exam is almost done because there is just oral exam only
In addition, I think I have to keep going on my online diary again
Keep training my English writing and make progress step by step
All of us choose to believe someone who we are near by and we share our secret to them, for the expression of our unbearable emotion
However, I choose to believe someone that I don't know
Someone who I'd ever seen, isn't very close to me
Since they are extremely close to me, I can't express all of my feelings and painful with them
I also can't share my secret to them, even through I want to say it loud
Whenever I'm facing them, I have to bear my desire of telling my secret
And my unbelievible feelings appear
In my mind, I'm pretty sure they'll tell the other after I tell my secret to them
It's so easy to imagine that they'll tell all the things to the classmates and thier friends, although I don't want anyone know it
So, I won't have any private in a short run
Base on the above reasons, someone that I have ever seen before and they're not very close to me is much better to believe
Since they're not know me, they're not study at school with me, I can express most of my feelings to them
I have no need to afraid that they'll tell the other because even if they do so, I won't be laughed by my classmates, friends for instance
Meanwhile, I can keep my own private
However, to be honest, I haven't believed someone completely
But we have to say, it's much better for you to express yourself to someone instead of friends, parents
etc, even if they're not faithful with you
PS: \"Someone is always better to believe
What's a bad day
Needless to say and no selection for me,I had to wear a lot of clothes and make my effort to keep my body warm before I went to school
Yes,I had act a snowman today
Actually,I didn't know and understand that why my school couldn't provide the warm water to all of the students after they had finish their physiologically need
Say it easily,it means that after you have pissed
Imagine that you have just finished pissing,when you are going to wash and clean your hands,you have to let the COLD water run through your hands
What's the 'great' feeling that is
The wind blowed my WET hands and I could feel my hands were shaking
Whatever,I know that I have to challenge the nature again tomorrow,even if I don't want to face it
I have to start my school life and face the reality again in this week
But unfortunately, it's not a good day
Although I was already used to do the heavy homework, I got a bad, bad prediction today
Since we were going to face the HKCEE, my teachers gave us a million of school work, and of course, also homework
However, today my English teacher told us that we had to stay after school for doing more and more exercises
So, you could imagine that how busy we would
To be honest, although I like studing English, I don't think this move can work
On the whole day, we are all exercising on different subjects
And you can understand it in ease, if you do too many similar works, just continue training and training, you will be very tried and you can't work up the enthusiasm
For these reasons, I think this action will just maltreat us and it can't make any help for our study
I want to study in the foreign
I hope to study in the other country, especially America or England
It's because in these countries' school, I can learn my favourite subjects such as philosophy and design
However, the most important thing is, I can learn the English by talking to the people there
I hate to be photoed
Topic: I hate to be photoed
And I hate to be photoed
However, there are always many people want to photo the other and I'm one of the victims
Even if they all know I don't want to be photoed, they ignore the situation
Yes, they ignore my feeling
Also, I cannot understand why I must cooperate with my classmates and take the photo together
Why I must take it
I can just feel that I'm in a jail
And my right, had been totally taken, even if just a small right

My occupation as private teacher started on December last year and I got the information about the vacancy from my friend, who also a private teacher too
On the first, I only had to teach a 3rd grade junior high school student who had to pass the national exam on April 2011
I was nervous on that day, because I didn't know why I was called, what topic that her mom want to talked, etc
And finally I came and we talked, she just asked me to come more often and also helped her to teach her 5th grade elementary school daughter and would arise my payment too
I came to their home not only for teaching but also be their friend
The exam had been passed and the result is very fantastic for me, for the beginner, for the newbie teacher
My first student is graduated with high score in Math and English, and my second student had her scores on report increased
From the previous experience in teaching, now I have some student

hello
I just joined lang-8
let me introduce myself here
I'm Jin, a 19-year-old man living in japan
I'm very lucky person
At first,I was in trouble
Many of my co-woker helped me to leran the new system 
They taught me kindly and speaking slowly
I'm very lucky person working with them.(or  I'm very lucky person to work with them
Because all of my co-worker is not Japanease
I said \"Thank you very much I'm very appreciate it 
But, I want to lean onother way
Are there any good word in English
Could somebady teach me

New Year's resolution
It's been 6 days since i returned from France
Nothing has changed here except that the visiblity is getting lower because of the sand traveling from the desert
I can even feel the sand between my teeth when i inhale
Which means, the sand storm is on the way
My English teacher once told me, an ambitious person only needs one resolution in his life while a person without ambition needs resolution every day
I just knew that i wasn't that kind of person with ambition
I don't even make a plan for a week let alone a life-time one
Live the life, make it simple
That's my philosophy which is also why i am now in the middle of nowhere,lol
I just wish things will be different in 2011, but i also know it will be just like other years
Things won't be different because you celebrated the last day with a bounch of unkown people drinking champagne
No new year's resolution for me, because i knew, i won't make it
Call me lazy, call me pessimist

Ashely is Korean famous family restaurant

This is my first entry to lang-8
My name  is yasu
I am urged to improve my writing, since I am having IELTS test next week
I took a mock test today, however, the result was terrible
I understood that the key to  advance it is simply writing a lot, making mistakes
Tough I can read many words, when it comes to writing it, I don't come up with them
To get high scores, it is crucial to use  more expressions than I have now as well as logical structure
I don't know how to use and make friends here in lang-8 well, as I have just registered
Anyway, I will submit now
How do you, people, think is there such a thing as the Russian soul
Some kind of a national character
I talked about it with foreigners twice
The first time it was a German guy, he had been seeing russian girl from Sankt-Pietersburg before our conversation, but they had broke down
But now although life is not as difficult, people are used to stay together to survive, and they don't feel themselves as independent as people of other nationalities do
Another conversation happened with Swedish guy, who is fond of Russia and whose dream is to immigrate here
We were talkind about different writers and he mentioned Bulgakov, I said Bulgakov is a Russion writer, he was surprised and asked me \"Really\", I answered \"OF COURSE
According to his opinion (and I agree with him) that feeling of superiority is very typical for Russians ( for example, OF COURSE all famous writers are Russians)))) but it is mixed with the feeling of insignificance of themselves -- such a paradox
That's just two features, two pieces of conversations I've had about \"Russian soul
my first \"hi-for-everybody\" here
Hi for everybody 
wanna write this first post about myself and my relationships with english
Firt time I got interested in it was when I studyed at school and joined an english study group
We read different english and american writers' books and discussed them from different points of view
Maugham, who is one of my favourite writers now
And there I read \"The catcher in the rye\" by J
Salinger in english (I had read it in  russian before and loved it very much
But I was complete fool in grammar then, so I couldn't express my thoughts the way I wanted it
Then, a few years later, I went to Germany by international exchange, there I had to communicate in english cause my german was even worse than my english, and my language barriere was broken there 
And the third point, I decided that the best way to learn something is to explain it to someone else
I started teaching young children and then adolscents english and finally got to know and learned something about english grammar
Prepositions and phrasal verbs - thats what driving me crasy now 
Last week, I made the panel for PC case with special tool (like picture
I used acrylic, LED, some connectors, and some electric parts
First, designing the panel with PC application
Next, cut the acrylic board with \"Auto cutting machine
And then, mount some LED and connectors
This is first time to write \" Lang -8
I'm DenDen in Japan
I want to learn English and to communicate with other persons
Living Japan

Eating ice-cream, photographing, spoking to good people
It's not be my diary
This school year I shall serious try to learn it

With love for comics

If I understood English well, I will be able to read many interesting books more than now
Or,I might be able to tell other people interesting point of Japanese
Those are why I learn English
 Valentine Day
It was a Valentain Day yesterday, so my child and I baked a chocolate cake
Of course we gave my husband a chocolate cake
At first I made
My summer is coming to the end
I will go back to school soon and I think it will be busy next term
I know i will start to learn French,which may be somewhat interesting anyway
But it was fine yesterday
Actually,I had tried to make cake before,but i never succeed
And when my girl asked me to do this with her,I thought i should try again anyway
Ice cream was not that complicated as we had imagined
We did have a rough time preparing for the cake
But guess what?The bottom was burnt,which really let me down
And what about the ice cream?I do not know
Hopefully,I will see what it is like from picture
Hope it will be better than the cake at least
Say hi to everybody
So just leave your message to me, than I'll add you to my friends
need more free to students! D
In Korea, most highschool students going home at 10 PM
so am I
There's no lesuire time on weekdays
I love watching dramas like Doctor Who, Sherlok, The Bigbang Theory
but I can watch these dramas on weekend only
It's horrible that restrain myself from watching dramas
and there are so many pressure about study
nobody loves study whole day
Many animals lost own habitat
Lately in Korea, Many environmental problems occured by Four River Project
the government said it will be helpful to Korea's economy
but many people didn't agree to government because it will be useless thing
the government insists that this project also makes tourist attraction, but it isn't
they destroyed famous place with great natural landscapes and also drived out many animals and plants from their habitat
the government didn't accept dissent of people because of their benefits
I want to many people in the world know about this and have interest more and more is this
I received 2 scam message in a week XD
Hi :) Have you ever received scam message in Lang-8

Social Networks make my world bigger
Lately, so many people are connected by social networks and messengers
so am I, I'm using Twitter, Facebook, Nateon and Skype :D
I think it's really worth to preserve what I did and what I'm thinking
and they are give many chances to make more relationships to me
it's funny to find different point between foreigners and me
sometimes many truth that I believed become lies
and also they give me knowledge about other countries that I didn't know before
literally they make my world bigger
Important of motivation
I found my old note which wrotedown some famous words by English
Maybe it is note of English subject
There are so many useful words like
The time when you think it's late is perpect time to do it.' and 'The man without motivation is not different from dead body
Anyway, after I saw this note I have some time to think about my motivation about why I'm studying English
It's really quiet simple
I'm studying English for play game which not translated to Korean
Although this is useless motivation, It was really important reason why I'm study English
Why did you started to learn other language
Before I started Lang-8 community
I just interested in English and Japanese
but since I started Lang-8 community
I wanna learn so many foreign languages
not only English and Japanese, but also French, Germany, some other languages
but it looks hard to learn these languages
so I decide to buy some language books after my exam has over
and I'll study some chinese character to read Japanese words
it's hard to read them 
need more study
My mid-term exams have done today
it was very hard time from wednesday to saturday

Even if I say \"我爱你\", it is an Italian speaking at that time
The Kannagi
I am watching the kannagi over PC
It is a story about the god in japan and a mere nymph-anime
I can't look up 美少女アニメ with English
I found it on the web and I'm watching it, and that it has tickers in Englsh and I can study English
I'm watching the kannagi which is found on the web, and that, it with English-tickers is useful for studying English
I'm wathching the kannagi is found on the web, and that, with English-tichkers is useful for studying English
Which is natural
It is so difficult that I can't translate the Japanese sentence into English one
I guess I use difficult grammars with Japanese or put away something for writing English
Nevertheless, languages are very difficult

We memorized a lot of English word and grammars at the school
We should learn how to express our thinking with simple English
The bus was almost fulled
I met a friend at Shinjyuku at first
it was the hottest day and I was lucky that the inside of art museum was cooler than outside
I felt relaxed to see many beautiful paintings taking a time
We had lunch Spanish restaurant near the museum as there were some people waiting for the tables at the restaurant in the museum
She has reserved the table in Izakaya
After eating, we went to Salsa lesson
I lately haven't practiced Salsa, but I enjoed it because there were nice people to lead me
I didn't drunk at all
I may be  strong to alcohol
I stayed with her place at night
I will talk about last Sunday(the next day
I check the mails and this site every day
I also like to read someone's ideas in daily life
Today I was wondering why I am taken up with reading diaries and correcting them
It happens to remind me
I was working in newspaper company
I was typing a lot of manuscripts after some jornalists wrote articles
Before publishing them, I had an advantage to read interesting news on the spot
So I love to read non fictions such as news,documents,life stories based on the real
I like to communicate with people ,not only talking with but also writting down ideas
I think it is easier to catch the personality and I am deeply affected by writting
In Japan,Japanese female like to think about blood type
There are some fortunetelling,such as palmreading,card reading,horoscope and so on
In your country, what is more populur about fortunetelling
I feel like a long way to talk with people in Spanish
When I practice Spanish,the words are not come out from my lips easily, insted of that,come up some english words soon
In my brain, it seems to be fulled up English and there are no capacity any more
I feel fool myself
Last Saturday, I went to eat out with my neighbers
We went to Japanese restaurant this time
We had one of typical Japanese seasonal dish(松茸土瓶蒸し
and Sasimi( raw fish), Crab,Tenpura and so on
I ate too much, but I believe that the total calorie is low
I am just thinking about breaking up
When people have to break up, what kind of things do they act
They are fighting ,swearng and arguing with each other
That kinds of things seem very unbearable
In my experience, I avoided fighting and swearing each other
 The case is not only man and female relationships but also friendsjps
Lately,I think I should have discussed the matter in details because I could let the person know what the problem was
I think it made the person more matured
Otherwise I would regrect that I didn't say anything
I go forward
Today  I had a tennis lesson in the morning
I usually have it every Tuesdays
I really like playing tennis with groups
I had two instructors,one is a man and the other is a woman
Feamale instructor is so nice and great
I appreciate her efforts to give me advices a lot
But male instructor is so strict
Please give me your addvice
More than 5years ago,I had a female friend  who lived and taught English to Japanese people
One day, I went to pick up her at her place
I thought she seems to be very tired
She suddenly said to me, My boyfriend dumped me
I was very supprised to hear that
She continued to say, we broke up
At that time I didn't say anything for her
I wish I had more English ability to encourage her, I would like you to correct this diary as usual
I also would ask all my Lang8 friends about it
Do you have some good expressions to give your friend who broke up with her boyfriend
My friend seemed very sleepy and she didn't seem to get up soon
I opened the curtain a little cause the room is dark and I didn't want to wake my friend up
I was reading the book for a while
And then she got up at last and toasted bread,made coffee for me
After having breakfast, We went to Ebisu( one of the city in Tokyo
The exbition was \"Look at me
Portrait photographs of nude.\" The photos were depicted various emmotions and relationships
First I thought there were many pohotographs which were depicted beautiful curves of figures of the object
I noticed there were many individuality or personality, kind of unique photographs in the exbition
It was nice experience for me
After seeing the art, we enjoyed the stage show which performed by amature musicians outside
How nice exploring in Tokyo
I finished to watch Japanese drama on Youtube today
The drama has 10 episodes
I started to see it from last Thursday, but I couldn't finish seeing all of them
I had other stuffs to do on weekends
I like Takizawa and Fukada who are Japanese actors
It doesn't cause any problem
I can be happy
I watched Japanese drama　流れ星 tonight
Today, the drama was climax and I was moved so much
So I desparately wanted to write my diary
Some girl was attempting suiside,another girl needs organ to be alive
Their lives are intertwined with( twisted around)each other
PS which is suitable expression
I happened to find this song, Yo ne se Manana, sung by Luis Enrique
Olympic games
Do you all watch Olympic games on TV or in Vanvouver
I watch it on TV
I was watching mogul games yesterday
I expected Japanese athelete 上村愛子 did her best
She did her great job,but unexpectedly,she was 4th rank
Actually,I am impressed by American skier  who gets the !st rank
She was perfect, She was very fast and performed beautifully
She showed us their dynamic movement
Bravo 
She deserves the gold medal 
I enjoy watching Prison Break Final on TV every Tuesdays
I usualy recorded it because the show is late to start
This tuesday, I forgot to record it
I am dissapointed with my forgetfulness
Today I had a chatting with my friend on skype
We sent messages each other on the real time
So I had some wrong spellings
I did wrong spellings a lot
Or I spelt a lot of  words wrongly
Or I typed wrong spellings a lot
Actually I  enjoy chatting with her and  I hope we had enough time to talk
Time diffrence is difficult to find the right time to talk each other
Yesterday I played tennis with some members  for about 7 hours
I have a little mascular pain on my body
Today is my relaxing time at home
In the program,it usually shows the great way to cook
It helps me a lot to cook for health and it takes only the short time
I like to cook delicious and healthy meels,not taking so long time
In the program, some guest like actor or actress come and have a chat
I like the situation as they show their actual face ,I think
I notice the colored leaves little by little
At the same time, I feel missing, somehow
Do you get the feeling like me
I saw the movie, the tytle is　魅せられて on cinema program on TV today
This is an American movie, but the location is Italy
The scene is beautiful
The actors are atttuctive and play the role great
I can't travel now, at least I enjoy seeing the movie in any locations
My allergy part 2
If I take some kind of medicine,my symptoms of allergy get well
But I feel dull,sluggish and sleepy which are side effects
That's the problem
I've heard vaccination is licenced in near future
I really expect that we can get it safely soon
I talk about my way to avoid the hottest days
I hooked on seeing the movies at home
I want to avoid the heat attack
So I lately see lots of movies at home daylight
When I am very moved by some sceans, I get gooss bumps and I can't stop my tears
It is no problem when I am seeing the movies alone at home, 
but it is embarransing for me to cry a lot in front of people at the movie theater
So I enjoy seeing the movies at home, I feel like leave me alone to focus on seeing the movies
Another way to avoid the hottest days, I enjoy reading books inside
Besides that,I have time to study English
That is great,isn't it
It is not so bad just to spend inside for a few months
I am patient to wait for Autumn
I would visit some places
Maybe I have a chance to walk around outside and I would visit some art museums in Tokyo and play temmis outside in my neighberhood
My friend always send me a lot of nice photos and told me some experience there
There are also some nice spots to go riding on bike
I want to visit her in my future
This summer was so hot, I avoided the strong sunlight daytime
I didn't get sunburned a lot
Japanese people usually say that Fall is the best for tasting seasonal foods and appreciating arts
I enjoy the both of them
After eating various foods, I know I should excersize more
I want to avoid to hold fat against the cold weather
I am tired of this hottest day
I like summer the best, but it is too hot doing outside
The other day, my friend emailed me that she would go to see the river side and swim there
I definetely wanted to join with her as I would avoid the hottest and I was bored just staying inside my house
He was a great driver in the narrow road headding the river
We found the nice spot where some people were already enjoying
When we were ready to go there changing the clothes in his car, some other people were leaving the spot
They already seemed to spend a lot
So we went there to soak ourselves, the situation is kind of owning the nice spot ourselves
The stream in the river is a little bit strong, so we just enjoy walking a little and soaking in the cold water
The cold water is comfortable to us
We didn't bring our swimming sandals,so we couldn't walk around because the basement was very slippery
I was very happy to talk with my friends seeing the blightening water splash
I had a lot of fun adventuring in the nature
I really like appreciating the nature
I'm happy because I like to cook the sesonal meal
After boiling chestnuts for a few minutes and peealed the skins
I made rice with some chestnuts seasoned with sweet sake, soysauce and salt
Before serving it, I sprincled のりand sesami & salt
栗ご飯is famous among Japanese people
It taseted fresh and good flavor
When I see the cherry blossoms, it reminds me the entrance ceremony
My farther took the photo of mine
I looked very proud smiling
My father gets older now
After his surgery, he gets better gradually and he enjoys meeting people and playing shougi(将棋)at the community center now
I was very excited to see new people and I was wondering how it was going in school life
High school life of mine is my most unforgettable one
I continue to talk about いきものがかりwho is a music band
When I listen to the lyrics of Yell, I get emotioned easily
Somehow I feel something,I can't express well,genuinely moved
Once I look for the songs on YouTube, I just can't stop
At least I suggest that everyone can practice Japanese with Karaoke on You Tube
I got the feeling that every skaters performed very well and they shawed their high techniques under all that pressures, many expectatons
I liked Miki andou's performance in the free skateing
I was moved to see Joannie Rochette' tears after the short skating
Mao Asada,the 19 year old captured the audience to complete a tripple axcel succcessfully
In her interview, it seemed that she was not satisfied with her free skating as she didn't it perfectly
I think she has got  a strong technique and she will challenge the competition again
Kim Yu Na is so strong to perform beautifully and perfectly
I like her perfoamnace in the short program
I haven't written a new entry because I had many things
Last month, I visited the art museum
I  had an appointment to visit there with my friend
I was late to arrive the museum because I was at a loss
Seeing the fine arts make me totally relaxed and it took me the old days
It also guided me some places I 've never been there, in  Europe
When I went to Paris, I didn't have a chance to visit surverb
I felt very romantic to see some paintings
Last sunday,I went to play tennis with some members
After a few hours, it's getting warm,and the sunlight became strong in the afternoon
Today was rainning and it was cold again
I think it is weird to have changeable weather here and there
The low of  nature is getting messed up 
I enjoy seeing cherry blossoms here and there now
I always drive my car to go out and I can naturally see beautiful cherry blossoms along the street in some places
We also enjoy seeing them in the parks,shrines,temples and bank along the river
There are cherry trees in line both side of the road, from the 甲府(Koufu)station all the way to takeda shrine
It seems a lot of cherry blossoms lead us to Takeda shrine
I will visit them and ask my mother to take a walk during this cherry blossom's season
The recipi of Japanese dish
Today, I talk about one of my favorite Japanese dishes
I have many favorote Japanese dishes
Although it it is difficult for me to choose only 1 recipe, I think this is a good one to bring to potluck party
Beef & Begetable Rolls
Salt & Pepper ( a little
Splead oil on the cooking sheet of oven plate
Bake for 20 minutes, occationally put soysause mixed mirin on 
and the taste comes into rolls very well
Serve them with tomatoes,lettuce or sliced cabbage
I hope you know or imagine this dish
It makes me happy to go out easily
I just wait for summer
I think spring is fresh and beggining in Japanese society
New grade is startng and new workers are joining the workplace
I feel like I get more energy this time of the year
Today I cooked {Boiled gut and liver of Chicken with soysause and suger
This dish is awarded by Japanese competition this year
This is original dish from Kofu city in Japan
I cooked it checking the recipe
I've cooked the similer one before, but it is the first time cook this one
The cooking way is very simple and it comes out deloicious
This dish is sustaining and nourishing meal
Olimpic Games 2
I was wondering if Kokubo ( Japanese snow boarder) performs very well
You may know it or not,he causes a lot of controversy in Japan because of some reasons
But he did his best and got the 8th place
I expect he is matured more and he has his future to challenge it next time
Aono ( Japanese boarder) also got the 9th place
They performed greatly although they had a lot of pressures there
My　dialy
It is the first time to write the dialy in this site
When i was a junior high student,I used to write my dialy in Japanese and I quit
After that,I sometimes write my dialy in English
It's instractive for me to memorize words
I think I am getting to used to speak English naturally little by little
I keep it up
Drama and movie
I lately hooked on watching drama and movie because i can watch them on cinema program on TV
I've got the trial from Hikaritv net
The trial system is only for 1 month
So I feel like I have to watch any program during this chance
At least,I get advantage to improve listening skill enjoying the movies
I noice that American movies have a lot of humor and Euroean and Azian movies have a great story line
My problem is that I can't stop wathing them
Moreover I have to be careful not to be fat staying in front of TV all the time
hooked on , addicted to , caught up in, Which is more common to use
Which is more natural to say
Some of my friends plan to go on a trip this end of year
I get envious, because I can't go traveling at this moment
One of my friends, she is planning to Australia
I wanna go there, I guess it is the middest of summer in Australia, the season is the oppsite of Japan
I like Summer the best,although we have to be careful not to get too much sunburned
Be careful not to get sunburned too much
He was a professional succer player
I rent the book because I like him very much and the book seems interesting, good material to learn new expressions
It seemed he wrote his mind in a natural way,straight forward
I admired his efforts and his potencial talents as a professional player
He played the succer match with his clever strategy
After his own decision to retire his career, he keeps his vision to encourage young player and children living in poor countries through playing succer
Nice to meet you, this is my fisrt entry and I hope to not make too many mistakes right from the beginning
The day after I will take an English exam, so I need to praticise a bit
Let me brifly introduce myself, firt
I'm studying English at University, not just because it's an important language to know, but also because I really like it
My main interests are cooking, travelling and listen to any kind of music, depending on my mood
I'm also interested in watching moto road racing, although I don't ride a bike
Currently I'm not doing any sport
But when I was small, I did a lot of them, like dancing, swimming, skiing, palying volley ball and tennis
Saddly, I had to quit bacause I didn't have enough time left to study
But now that I'm a University student I can start again
After becaming elementary school
It began to yearn for curly hair style, a cute girl who wear pierced earing
At that time, there are not many people who wear pierced earing even for adults around me
Of course I think nobody could not image that the guys became wear pierced earing like a Lady
Is that same as America
Even now it still do not see often the young girl wearing pierced earing in Japan
I think it is because of Japanese school rule
It seems are getting more mild from my school days but still have a \"school rule\" in Japan
Let me introduce \"What is a Japanese school rule for my school days?\" for next my diary
Hi everyone, I am really appreciate it you read my diary and your help
As you know we have a school uniform in Japan and also usually wear a T-shirt or a camisole under the uniform
But I had to be white color
It was not accept another color
Also we had a school shoes, everyone had to wearing exact shoes with a specified shocks
Which was must be all white color or one or two borderlines with white color
They checked out all of student every month…
Why did we have to be wear same things, have to be same hair style
But first I visited Paris myself for 2nights…to travel along was my first experience, feel was so lonely
It was not too bad more then I though, but always had to have foods along, did not able to share how much there are beautiful
After that, my friends joined my trip, it made me more fun
Have you been to travel your self
Did Japanese strict school rules made me a person with a half brain
I believe that I was learned how much important to have rules and follow a line to spend in many people with comfortable
After 16 years later, I could understand it…
Looking back, it is coming in useful for my common sense
However around time, I could not understand it
I wished if I were an American girl and I definitely wear in style cloths to school with stylish hair
From that time, it was started to have an interesting about America more than when I was young
You might have thought that I give up this diary after three days.(We called it Mikkabouzu:三日坊主 in Japan
But no~, actually I was taking weekend off
Today I will write some Japanese school rules when I was junior high school
It still make me a laughing at the memories.(LOL
Boys:clean-shaven head with maximum 7-8mm
I totally forgot exact number of length, but I am sure it was under 1cm
Girls:If you have a bangs, the length should be above the eyebrows
Also the length is your hair should be above your shoulders
Of course whatever you are boy or girl cannot have a hair color\/perm
Especially I had a long hair since I had a permission

I have never written a English diary in my life, but I will try to keep writing and hope polish my English skills at this opportunity
Why I started to learn English

I am just staring to have interesting in America and thinking America is like my dream land

What did I have an interst about America
The fabulous gifts my aunt gave me was always so fantastic
All of them I had never seen in my life, like an animal design bed cover be glow by electronic and lighter, colorful bathing costume etc
I had only a  ugly dark color bathing costume as it called \"school swimming suit
When I was young as more than 20 years ago, in Japan there are not really cute any fashionable children clothes I think
So my colorful some clothes was always my boast
And also some pictures, she showed me was made me shock
they are living big house with fancy interiors
And another thing, the street in town was so wide
It's was when I was 4 or 5 years old, I had never seen some foreign moves
In the picture, people have different color eyes, hair and skin
so cute! like a doll that I used to play 
to be continue
クラスマッチ　is  like the sports festival

Today, I went for an outing to a kind of theme park with my family
Unexpectedly, there was Japanese Drum Show
The show was performed by Ondekoza
which is one of famous Japanese Drum performaner groups in japan
Anyway, It was nice to listen the drum sound outside
If you look at each Katakana, you can find alphabet which shows the pronunciation of the word
Then I was inspired by those fonts and created \"TREE\" font
without those help

I wish everyone spend happytime on the Valntine's day
I want to learn English because i need it to my future
I want to go to a country which its official language is English to learn and improve my English
There are \"five senses\" very important to me
This sense is always the pride of myself.(I noticed that my hand writing was uprising while I wrote this article on papers) My recent writing is pretty well, I hope I can keep it up, and the flowing inspirations are always there when I am writing lyrics
Although I'd like to call myself an \"English lover\", I know my attainment of English is hilarious, when it comes time to write
Dear Rachel, my friend of language exchange, what are you busy at recently
You haven't sent me email for a while, I can't help myself to feeling lonely
In the recent six months, I was fascinated by the world of rhythm
I joined a band to play Djembe and Cajon last month
The band name is kind of porno, so I think it is inappropriate to translate it to English here.(actually, I have no idea how to translate it.) Seems like cynicism, but the band members are very earnest and play very well
The worth mentioning thing is, beginning from the last week, something inspires me when I was practicing the hand drums, I played a lot of new patterns and good at flamenco all of sudden
I wouldn't say I have sense of rhythm, I still have a long long way to go, but my hands have started to feel something, it is delightful
continue
I know there is full of mistakes in this article, please feel free to tear this to shreds

It must be more than a year that I didn't practice my English
It sounds like an excuse but I spent most time in studying Japanese
But now when I want to speak(or write) in English, I found that I think the sentences in Japanese first
After coming back to Taiwan, I usually stay home all day because I am so lazy to go out
Now, if I have free time, I'll just go downstairs and spend not very long time doing some exercise

To learning foreign language is too difficult, but I study hard
I want to speak English and Spanish, of course Japnese
Hey, guys
I've noticed that being polite in English-speaking cultures is extremely important, whereas it's not so in Argentina
For instance, I've been told that saying \"What?\" when you haven't understood what somebody has just said is not good manners
Instead, you should say: \"I'm sorry, could you repeat that?\", \"Sorry, didn't quite catch that
My friends will come to Singapore

When anything does not meet his expectation, he will throw lots of vulgar words on you with his temper tantrum just like one of those kids
Suck it up:  Whatever the client does to me and no matter how hard the job is, I have to suck it up for my career, but when the client runs off the edge in common sense or moral to hurt me, I will not just let him violate my dignity
Actually, it happened few times
On the other hand, the crystallized intelligence will full of my head to make the ability of learning new thing harder, and I guess that is why some people are getting stubborn as they get older
Some older people like to suggest you something or tell you what to do and they believe that they are right because they have as similar experience as yours or have more life experience than you
When I was 10, there was no the internet, but nowadays, 10 years old children starts touching PCs and using the internet, so if they have their own PCs, or parents allow them to use, they can know something they do not know from the internet without adults' help
